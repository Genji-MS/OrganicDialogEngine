No need to respond. Bye. There are no new messages. Thank you for using this terminal. {FF80}! Hitomi, too! You came to save me? You're such a klutz. Are you okay? Yeah, I guess... Did Leader tell you to do this? ...Y-Y'know, I've had time to cool off and think about things while I've been locked in here. Ratting us out and locking us up doesn't make sense, does it... You finally get it! It wasn't Leader. You see... Okay... So, Yu-Ichi... Crap, I can't believe myself! Is Leader being held somewhere in here, too? That's right. I thought you might all be held together, but... So you haven't rescued him or Six, then? Dammit! If only I'd believed Leader... ...It's not too late to start. Let's work together and find the others. All right. We need to find Leader and save him, no matter what. Let's see... {FF80}, I know it's dangerous, but we don't have time. Let's split up. I'll look around the L tower and contact you if I find anything. You check the other areas. Okay. Come on, {FF81}, let's go. {FF80}! Hitomi, too! You came to save me? You're such a klutz. Are you okay? Yeah, I guess... Did Leader tell you to do this? ...Y-Y'know, I've had time to cool off and think about things while I've been locked in here. Ratting us out and locking us up doesn't make sense, does it... You finally get it! It wasn't Leader. You see... Okay... So, Yu-Ichi... Crap, I can't believe myself! Is Leader being held somewhere in here, too? That's right. We've already rescued Six. He's investigating the R tower now. Dammit! If only I'd believed Leader... ...It's not too late to start. Let's all work together and find him. All right. We need to find Leader and save him, no matter what. Let's see... If you've got Six checking out the R tower, then I'll look around here in the L tower. You guys go see if you can find anything suspicious. I'll call you if I find anything. ...Okay. {FF81}, let's start looking elsewhere. ...Huh? {FF80}! Hitomi! What are you doing here!? What do you think? We're here to rescue you! Yeah? But why!? You've got no reason to help me now! You dumbass! We come all this way to free you, and that's all you have to say! Listen, Leader's not the one who tricked you. The truth is... ...It was Yu-Ichi? Then that mail from Kadokura was all a hoax? Exactly. You fell for the enemy's plan, hook, line, and sinker. Dammit! I shoulda had faith in Leader... It's not all lost yet. We're not too late. We can still save Leader and Lunch. You're right. I can't leave things like this! But still... If we stay together, it'll take too long... I'll investigate the Monolith's R tower. {FF80}, Hitomi, can you guys check out the other places? I want those two saved as soon as we can. That's okay with you, right? ...Yeah. All right. I'll let you know if I find anything. I'm counting on you. ...Huh? {FF80}! Hitomi! What are you doing here!? What do you think? We're here to rescue you! Yeah? But why!? You've got no reason to help me now! You dumbass! We come all this way to free you, and that's all you have to say! Listen, Leader's not the one who tricked you. The truth is... ...It was Yu-Ichi? Then that mail from Kadokura was all a hoax? Exactly. You fell for the enemy's plan, hook, line, and sinker. Dammit! I shoulda had faith in Leader... It's not all lost yet. We've already rescued Lunch, and he's looking around in the L tower right now. If you want to save Leader... Of course! I won't let it end like this! ...If Lunch is checking out the L tower, I'll take the R tower. You guys look around for anything that seems funny. ...Yeah. All right. I'll let you know if I find anything. I'm counting on you. Ugh... Wh-Who are you...? H-Hey, this guy's Kadokura. Hah. I've been waiting to meet you. How dare you make fools of us! Where is Leader? I... I see. You're from... Spookies... You made it, then... Made it... this far... Wh-What's wrong with him? Does he have a headache or something? Like I care. Let's start beating him until he talks. Wh-Why...? What makes people like this appear...? Why do my ideas crumble...? This is not what I wanted my network to bring to the world... What are you yapping about? You're the one who made that system that sucks out people's souls! My network... It was meant to be a place for people to communicate, to bring the world together... But... Ha ha, haha... Look at the reality... It simply digitized the dark side of man, and filled minds with lies. It caused the psychological decline of culture that denies the very existence of truth. And in the end... Ha ha ha... it even became a weapon... to take people's lives... I-I-I... Ha... I didn't mean any of this... Wh-What is wrong with him? Dude, are you okay? I... I'm sorry... I shouldn't have... created this horror... B-But... Nishi... Nishi tricked me... and this is how it ends... Nishi? As in the Vice Minister? It was him... He's a member of the Phantom Society... and the mastermind behind this project... He's on the upper floor of this central section. I'll unlock the door... Please... He has to be stopped... Hey, what should we do with him? There's no point in dealing with him if he doesn't put up a fight. Saving Leader's our top priority. ""Leader..."" Are you talking about Sakurai? You know something? I'm sure it was Nishi that lured you here... He, of all people, would know where Sakurai is held. Why don't we pay Nishi a visit, then? That'd be the quickest way. Yeah... All right, let's go. ...... Aaa-aaaaagh... It hurts... I-I... aaaaaaaagh... Kadokura's gone...! Where'd he go? Ha ha ha... Today is a day of splendor. You could call it... the start of our new future. Welcome, members of Spookies. This is the first time we have met, but is there really a need for introductions? I didn't think you were the one behind this stupid scheme, Vice Minister Nishi. This entire city was your plan! Ha. It is far more than some ""stupid scheme."" We are carrying out mankind's duty. What duty? Stealing souls? You're saying that's what we're here for? In the end, humans are but vessels. This city is bait to draw them together and expand the network. And what are you going to do now? Soon, with the antenna on this building's roof, we will begin to operate Paradigm X on a worldwide scale. Then, the number of souls we collect will grow at a simply unfathomable rate. You bastard! You're going to spread your disease all over the world!? Why? What are you going to do with so many human souls!? They will be offered to our Master... No... Not simply ""our"" Master, but the master of all. Tch, this guy's nuts! Listening to him's a waste of time. You cannot deny that we have collected a great many souls. With Manitou's help, it will be even easier. What is this ""Manitou""!? What's it got to do with Nemissa!? Nemissa? How do you know about Nemissa? I'M Nemissa! Now tell me what you know! Hitomi, what are you saying? Nemissa? You're Nemissa!? Hahahahaha! Of all the luck! The one factor of uncertainty, the missing piece that we thought had been lost forever... ...And you come right to us! This really is a great day. I have no more need to feign humanity. Your souls will be offered to my Master. Hahahahahaha! I am Azazel, testimony to darkness, and its king! Holy-! Looks like he's not gonna tell us where Leader is...! {FF80}, Hitomi, we'll leave him to you! We're going to the roof to destroy that antenna! We'll tear him to pieces! Be careful! ...Foolish humans. I will tell you what the Phantom Society is before you die. We are the ones who created you and what you call history. Mankind are mere chattel, created and raised by us... You created us!? Get real! Humanity's history is based on our free will! No one controls us! The conceit that keeps you from accepting that others have power over you is proof of your human foolishness. We have tolerated your ignorance and your insolence, but no more. The time has come. Your souls must be collected. For the sake of our coming Master... Enough. You will be destroyed in every way it is possible to be destroyed, and your souls thrown to Manitou. Ha... Young Summoner, and... black witch... So you were the ones who defeated Shemyaza. Very well. It has been far too long since I used this form in battle. This will be a worthy battle. Urgh...... I-I lost...? To... mere beasts... It's over, Azazel! For both you and your scheme! ...Ah... Ahahaha... Do you really think you've won!? Do you think our plans have truly been halted? ...You merely thrash against the bars of your cage... The Phantom Society is everlasting. We are with the Master of all... This is not the end... Know that my death is only the beginning of a never- ending battle. Hahaha... Ahahahaaa! ...Azazel knew about Nemissa, too. He said I was a ""factor of uncertainty..."" What I don't know about myself... and... Manitou... What would Hitomi say at a time like this... ...I'm sorry. I know this is all my fault... Anyway, let's get to the roof. Aren't you worried about Lunch and Six? Whoa... Ooh, Hitomi, {FF80}. You guys okay? Did you guys do this? Not bad! Heh heh, yeah. The Phantom Society's plans are down the drain! Hey, we can't celebrate just yet. We need to find Leader. Let's surprise him with our success. You defeated Nishi? L-Leader! What, you're all right!? ...... Check it out, Leader. Phantom's plans are completely crushed. We won. ...... Uh, Leader? What's wrong? You're not happy? Well... Er... You still angry at us? You know... for... Hey, we're not gonna make excuses. I'm sorry. We should've had more faith in you. ...Don't worry about it. I'm actually very happy. Because... heh... Because now, I... Heh ha ha... I can kill you myself! Ahahaha! L-Leader!? What's wrong with you!? Shemyaza and Azazel have fallen, and only I remain. But, I'm fine with that. As long as I have Manitou, I can collect souls. Even better, I can have the winnings all to myself. H-Hey! Leader, what're you talking about!? You... You're not Leader. Who are you? Huh? Hitomi... {FF80}, too? What's wrong, everybody? What am I--! Wha--M-My body's... Urrrgh! So there you have it. You should thank me for being merciful enough to allow you to die by your friend's hand. Hahaha! What the hell's going on!? Isn't that Leader!? What the--!? He isn't Leader!? No... He's been possessed by a demon... Get back to HQ, you guys. We'll deal with him. What do you mean, ""deal with him""? What're you gonna do to him!? We're gonna save him. ...I just don't know how. Just go! ...O-Okay. Please, save Leader for us. Let's go, Six! Tch... Why do we have to be so powerless when it's so important... Sorry, but we've got to count on you! Hee hee! You plan to beat me, Satanael? Ha, that's a good one. Do you think you're up to it? Can pathetic humans like you kill this man? We can save Leader, {FF81}. We can't let that demon do whatever it wants with him... Ugh...... Ughhh...... Leader, can you hear me? I... Ah, I see... The two of you stopped me...... Sorry about that. Ha... Haha... How pathetic... Letting myself get taken over... cough cough L-Leader... I... It's okay... I wanted it... this way... It's better than hurting you... I'm sorry... This was... the only thing I could do... But, it's funny... Only now, do I know my own heart... I was jealous of Kadokura's skill, but I pretended not to see it by hiding in my own little hacker world, Spookies. This was all for the better. You saved me...... Urgh... cough cough Leader! No... Hitomi! Hitomi! Please, come out. Leader's... Leader's dying...... Hitomi! ...Leader? I see... It happened... to you, too... Hitomi... I-I... Leader... Leader... I can't... remember who you are... No...! I know you... You're someone I know very well...! Why can't I remember who you are!? ...{FF80}... Save Hitomi... for me... And also... the girl... who's crying behind her... ......It'll be okay... I know you can do it... ...I feel better now... I... I'm tired... Let me sleep... Just for a little while... Huh!? No... No, don't die! Leader... Leader! Please don't die! Leader! Hitomi's... she's not coming out anymore... We stopped their plan, but with everything that's happened... Wh-What is this!? What happened to the antenna!? You! I can't collect souls like this! The Carriers can't come back! Was it you who destroyed it!? Wait, why are you talking about collecting souls? All you had to do was kill Azazel and Satanael! But this... Damn you! You were using us? You're not part of the Phantom Society! Why do you want to collect souls!? Manitou wants them. More and more souls! But, now that it has come to this, I'm done with you. I'll banish you to the digital world! What!? Who are you!? Goodbye, Nemissa, you alma of death born from Manitou! Ugh...... Ughhh...... Leader, can you hear me? I... Ah, I see... The two of you stopped me...... Sorry about that. Ha... Haha... How pathetic... Letting myself get taken over... cough cough Don't try to talk, you'll hurt yourself even worse. Don't worry, you're going to be safe. I promised everyone that we'd come home with you. I know you'll pull through. Lunch, Six, Yu-Ichi... They're all waiting for you. So have faith in us, and don't strain yourself. ...Gotcha. I can't go... making you a liar... Then... I'll take a... nap... He's breathing steadily. He'll be all right. If we take him to HQ, we can get him some medical care in time to save him. Let's hurry, {FF81}! Wh-What is this!? What happened to the antenna!? You! I can't collect souls like this! The Carriers can't come back! Was it you who destroyed it!? Wait, why are you talking about collecting souls? All you had to do was kill Azazel and Satanael! But this... Damn you! You were using us? You're not part of the Phantom Society! Why do you want to collect souls!? Manitou wants them. More and more souls! But, now that it has come to this, I'm done with you. I'll banish you to the digital world! What!? Who are you!? Goodbye, Nemissa, you alma of death born from Manitou! ...... ......You're all right now. You can open your eyes. This is the world that lives on inside of me, inside your mother's embrace. The world once sang us a song, and she quietly took me in. That is why we never forgot. The great voice of the land... Its sacredness, and its gentleness... However, as the years passed, man forgot how to hear the land's song. We became rootless. The calamity that has come to this world is something that humanity has beckoned. I am Kinap, the last ember of the spirits of those who lived in harmony with the land. This is the last time I will speak to you. I shall tell you of my memory. It was I who sealed Manitou away, so that a calamity such as this could never happen again. Manitou itself is like a stone. It has no soul, no self. It is... a pure spirit, infinitely pure. But purity without a self is like a river that never bends: if man tries to intervene, it rages. That is why I attempted to give all of myself to the mother land. Just as she did me, I thought I could contain Manitou. But, Manitou had already met humanity. And it learned of madness. My voice can no longer reach it. In order to stop Manitou, it must be destroyed. There is no other way. However, it does not know ruin. It does not know that just as all life awakens to song, all life ends with song. In order to destroy Manitou, it must learn the song of death. And the one who knows this song... is Nemissa. The memory within her has already been awakened. When you awaken, she will have found her path. , death is something possessed by all life. When it happens, it is because it is supposed to happen. But it is not sadness that surrounds death. It is a celebration of the cycle of life and death turning once more. Please, save Manitou. I am Kinap, a man who became a spirit to watch over Manitou since ancient times. The world once sang us a song, and she quietly took me in. That is why we never forgot. The great voice of the land... Its sacredness, and its gentleness... However, as the years passed, man forgot how to hear the land's song. We became rootless. The calamity that has come to this world is something that humanity has beckoned. I am Kinap, the last ember of the spirits of those who lived in harmony with the land. , you stand at the very balance between life and death. A common man would already have fallen into the land of the dead. But the strength in your heart lets you stay. Father, mother, siblings, friends, lovers... The feelings of those around you are the power one needs to live. When I see you, I see...  myself, in my own tribe, long ago. We turned our emotions in life into song, so that we did not feel regret, not even when someone dies. The Song of Death is what we would sing at the end of a life, but it is also a song for when one must be strongest. ...There will come a time when you will sing that song. But now is not that time. The one who should be singing it is Manitou, for the meaning of life has become lost to it. Manitou, has been defiled by the souls of humans who also do not know death. This cannot be reversed... But, if it can sing the Song of Death, it can be stopped. And the one who knows this song... is Nemissa. The memory within her has already been awakened. When you awaken, she will have found her path. ...My words end here. Without a body, I can only trust that you will be able to do what must be done. I am Kinap, a man who became a spirit to watch over Manitou since ancient times. That was Kinap's true form... Or more like, what he looked like when he was human... He opened the door to my memory. And he told me my past. Manitou is my... parent, for lack of a better word. Kinap split Nemissa from Manitou in order to destroy it. Because only I can destroy Manitou... It makes sense why Moowis would attack me. He was also a demon born from Manitou. And not just Moowis. Winpe at the airport, Malsum at Algon Soft... All of them were demons born from Manitou. Of course, the Phantom Society didn't want them to appear. They all sprang forth from Manitou as it went mad... Endlessly hungering for souls... and attacking anything that could threaten Manitou... The Phantom Society can't control Manitou any longer. But Manitou can't control itself, either... It will only continue to devour souls until it goes on a never-ending rampage. We have to hurry and stop it... ...... Heh. Do you think it's weird that I'm saying something like this? Me, too. I'm just so calm... It's like something has been lifted from my shoulders. But my thoughts are clear: this is the best solution. You think so too, don't you? This is something that only those of us who are living can do. Now let's go back to HQ. ...We need to inform everybody about Leader...... That was Kinap's true form... Or more like, what he looked like when he was human... He opened the door to my memory.

Now let's go back to HQ... ...This is a joke, right!? Leader's... This can't be happening! ...... I'm sorry... We couldn't... We had to... To hell with you! You had to do it!? You had to kill-- Six... It's not {FF80} and Hitomi's fault... ...I'm sorry. I don't mean to blame you. I-It's just...! Spooooooookyyyyyy! I'm so sorry! If only... I-If only I hadn't been b-b-brainw-washed! Dammit... I thought we were able to finally crush their plans... But Kadokura was behind it all... What're we gonna do? We can't back down now! We've got to avenge Leader! We interrupt the scheduled broadcast to bring you breaking news. The Amami Monolith in Nikamimon has been coated in an unknown material. ...And we have just received new footage. The material has yet to be identified, and the police have issued a statement to the following effect: ""Due to the unpredictability of the situation, the entire ward of Nikamimon will be closed."" The chief of police... What the hell is this? This that ""Manitou"" Hitomi was talking about? That thing... Hey, look at that! What's that on the roof? ...An antenna? It looks like an antenna. What!? But we just destroyed that giant antenna right around where that thing is...! Then, that weird material's being used to replace the antenna? It's Kadokura! He's still there. He hasn't given up! He's got balls, to pull this stunt. Let's crash his party and stop him once and for all! But the whole area's been blocked off. We won't be able to get inside the building. What'll we do? ......I'll ask Dad for help. He has influence within the company. You're gonna ask your dad!? Are you sure about this? Yeah... I'll call him right now. Hold on. ...Okay. He'll meet us in front of Algon Microelectronics. He said he has something to tell us, too. We should get a move on, then. Let's go, {FF80}. We were able to make it back. We need to hurry and rescue Leader... You don't need to worry. We saved him. Yu-Ichi... and you're... He begged me to take him to the Monolith, so I did. We were on our way to the roof after hearing that explosion... and we found him there, unconscious. ...... How is he!? I can't really say. Physically, he should be able to recover, but... ""But""? I can't say the same for what remains of his consciousness... or what you might call his ""soul"". Soul... ...We'll look after him. You have your own mission to complete. I'll be going now. If his condition changes, I'll contact you. Good luck, all of you. ...We're not out of the woods, but there's still hope... Thank goodness. ...I see. Leader's...... It's not the worst-case scenario, but we can't rest just yet, huh... I'm sorry, everyone... If only... If only I didn't go and get captured... What're you saying, man? Without you, Leader might not have been rescued. Yeah. You did well... for you, anyway. Still... I thought we were finally able to crush their plans... But Kadokura was behind it all... What're we gonna do? We can't back down now! They're gonna pay for what they did to Leader! ""Welcome to Paradigm X!"" There is new information on Summoner Net. You have no new messages. There is no new information on Summoner Net. Hey, {FF81}. Let's go to Algon Microelectronics first... Access to the R20F express elevator granted. Access to the R20F express elevator, Central Station, and upper levels granted. Yo, {FF80}. The code to get you up above is ""PIXY"". {FF80}, the code over here's been entered, but you need another one over there. The code for the other side should be ""FLY"". {FF80}, the code here is ""WIZ"". {FF80}, check it out! It's accepting the passcode! Code accepted. Unlocking the R20F express elevator. We've got a connection to Central Room 1-L and Central Station, and access to the upper levels. All you need is to enter the password for over on the right side... the password's ""FLY"". ...It looks like both passcodes have been entered. Now for the two upper codes. ""PIXY"" here and ""TWIN"" there. Just a little more... Let's do this for Leader, {FF80}. Yo, {FF80}! Great timing! I just got a call from Lunch and unlocked all the rooms in Tower R. You should be able to get into the rooms that you couldn't enter on the way here. Also, I've managed to dig up the layout of this Monolith. Listen up. Obviously, it's split into two large towers. Both towers are split at the 20th floor into upper and lower areas. So, there are four sections: L Upper, L Lower, R Upper, and R Lower. And each of these areas has a control room that grants access to the other areas, like the Central Section. We'll need a password for these control rooms in order to do that. It would seem that part of the password is entered on each of the floors, starting from the floor below us. But, there's a problem... I don't know the password. Hey Six, can you hear me? Oh, cool, you've got {FF80} with you. I can tell you both at the same time. Pay attention. I found some sort of scrambled code over here. I tried entering it into my decoder. ...And something came up! I'll spare you the details. The keyword is ""The Flying Wizard and the Twin Pixies."" ...What the hell's that supposed to mean? Hang on, I'm not done. I decoded it a second time. That time, it said TWIN, PIXY, FLY, and WIZ. But I think how they were displayed is the important part. Top-left was TWIN, top right was PIXY, bottom-left FLY, and bottom-right WIZ. Hm... Four sections, split by left, right, top, and bottom... Just like the Monolith, huh? That's what I was thinking. There should be a place to input those passwords. {FF80}, go look for somewhere you can input them. I'll keep investigating here. I'm counting on you. Upper-L TWIN, Upper-R PIXY, Lower-L FLY, Lower-R WIZ, huh... I'll check out this room for a while longer, so you go input those passwords. If you find out anything, I'll be here. We're counting on you, {FF80}. Yo, {FF80}. This place looks pretty suspicious doesn't it? I'm going to check this place out. I'll handle things here, so you go look around elsewhere. What is this place? It looks like a main server room, but we need to find everyone else. Well, here's how it boils down. The Monolith is split into the Left and Right towers, and each tower is split into Upper and Lower levels. Each area has a password, and each floor in that area needs to have part of the password entered somewhere. Once all of the passwords are entered, we should be able to gain access to all the areas and the Central Section. The passwords are: Upper-L: TWIN, Upper-R: PIXY, Lower-L: FLY, Lower-R: WIZ. If you find out anything more about these passwords, come back here. area is ""FLY""... Code accepted. Unlocking the L20F express elevator. We've got a connection to Control Room 1-R and the Central Section, and access to the upper levels... huh. Access to L20F express elevator granted. Access to L20F express elevator, Central Section, and upper levels granted. Hey, {FF80}. The code for above is ""TWIN"". {FF80}, you've entered the code for this side, but not for the other tower. The code should be ""WIZ"". {FF80}, the passcode here is ""FLY"". {FF80}, check it out! It looks like it accepted the passcode! Code accepted. Unlocking the L20F express elevator. We've got a connection to Control Room 1-R and the Central Section, and access to the upper levels... huh. Now for the right side... The magic word is ""WIZ"". ...Looks like both codes have been accepted. The ones you need now are the two upper areas... ""TWIN"" on this side, and ""PIXY"" on the other. Just a little more... Let's do this for Leader's sake, {FF80}. {FF80}! You couldn't have come at a better time! I just unlocked the rooms of the left tower. There were some rooms you couldn't get into, right? They should be open now. I called Six, so if it's the same situation over there, he should have them unlocked, too. Oh, and I think I found a code while I was searching this room. So I ran it through the decrypter, and... Well, check it out. .................. FRVÆ KVCAVÆ JG QANQENÆ MVJTAVÆ LYS .................. seiÆ xiPniÆ wTehT dnAdraÆ ziWgniÆ ylFehT ..................

TWINPIXY      FLYWIZ ...... Looks like this is the real message. I'm pretty sure those are passwords, but they'll have to be entered somewhere. Hey, Lunch! It's me! Can you hear me? Huh? {FF80}'s there, too? Then listen, both of you. I figured out the Monolith's layout, so I called. Obviously, it's split into two large towers. Both towers are split at the 20th floor into upper and lower areas. So, there are four sections: L Upper, L Lower, R Upper, and R Lower. And each of these areas has a control room that grants access to the other areas, like the Central Section. We'll need a password for these control rooms in order to do that. It would seem that part of the password is entered on each of the floors, starting from the floor below us. But, there's a problem... I don't know the password. You need the passwords? Ha! Let me handle that! {FF80}, with what Six and I have found out, this is what I'm thinking... Each of these four areas Six mentioned is going to need a password. And, this little diagram we have tells us what these passwords are: TWIN and FLY on the left, PIXY and WIZ the right. {FF80}, you go look for someplace where you can input those passwords. If you find out anything, come back here. I'm counting on you. Hey, {FF80}. There has to be something important in this room. I'm going to keep looking. Could you guys go check out someplace else? What is this place? It looks like a main server room, but we need to find everyone else. When we put together what Six and I have found, here's what we think is how this place works: First off, the Monolith is separated into four sections. Upper and lower L Tower, and upper and lower R Tower. Each of these areas has a password, which needs to be entered at the Central Station in order to access them. Apparently, there are devices on each floor that will let you enter part of the password for the area they're in. Upper L is ""TWIN"", Upper R is ""PIXY"", Lower L is ""FLY"", and Lower R is ""WIZ"". If you learn anything else about the passwords, come on back here. Password required. The passcode here is ""PIXY"". Let's hurry. Access to R20F-R39F express elevator granted. Connection with Control Room 2-L established. Access to Central Section granted. Hey, {FF80}? I can see from here that all the passcodes have been accepted. I'm going to head up to the Central Section. I'll contact Six as well, so let's meet up there. See you in a bit. Code accepted. Unlocking the R20F-R39F express elevator. Access to R20F-R39F express elevator and Central Section granted. Password required. The passcode over here was ""TWIN"", right? Access to L20F-L39F express elevator granted. Connection with Control Room 2-R established. Access to Central Section granted. Hey, {FF80}? I can see from here that all the passcodes have been accepted. I'm going to head up to the Central Section.
