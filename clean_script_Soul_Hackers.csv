0,"Hello. Welcome to the Amami Net terminal. You have 1 new message. Brother, this is a test mail. Did you get it? No need to respond. Bye. There are no new messages. Thank you for using this terminal. Ha... You made it all the way here after all, kid. What!? You can't even handle your own demons! I don't need to take that from you. I'm on my way to defeat Malsum. But before I do, I was thinking of a light warmup. A warmup? Get your COMP out, boy. I'll show you right here who's the stronger Summoner. Come on! I'll wash off the shame of losing to you! Urgh... I was planning... to finish you... and beat... Malsum... You might beat me... but can you... defeat it...? Even if you do... that monster can't be stopped. It'll just... happen again. If only... If only we could find N-Nemissa... then... maybe... ......... Huh!? How do you know me!? Answer me! ...He's dead. He won't be telling us anything. He did say ""Nemissa..."" What did he know...? ...I don't care what they say. I'm me. I'll do what I want! {FF81}, we're going to defeat Malsum. SOULS... GIVE ME... SOULS... HUMANS... YOU MADE IT HERE? SO... MY BARRIER HAS BEEN UNDONE... WHY!? WHY DO YOU DRIVE MANITOU MAD!? WHY DO YOU TRY TO DESTROY ME!? ARRRRRRGH... WHAT!? TH-THIS PRESENCE... NO! NOOOOOOO! THIS IS NEMISSA! THIS IS DESTRUCTION! GAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! Th-This is Malsum? How does it know Nemissa, too? What's going...? I... I feel...... How!? Finnegan, this demon... How does everyone know me!? What do they know about me!? What is this ""Manitou""!? Nemissa... You have to... calm down...  ...Hitomi? Are you all right? ...Hey you! Are you causing this!? Well, fine, then! I'll kill you right now! This is the machine, isn't it? If we break this, they won't be able to collect any more souls, right? Here goes! One... Two... Nemissa... Stop... If you do... what happens to... the souls inside...? They might be... lost forever... {FF81}'s father... Huh? What's wrong, Hitomi!? We beat Malsum already! ...I'm sorry, I'm... just... so tired... Just... let me rest...... Hitomi? Hitomi!? What's wrong!? Hitomi! Hey, wake up! What're we gonna do...? We're not done yet... ...{FF81}, let's head back to HQ. Then... let's figure out what to do along with Leader... Oh {FF81}, welcome back. You were out for a while. Did you finish whatever it was you were doing? This city is full of all the latest gadgets, but I can't use any of them, so I don't care much about it. Of course, your father just loves all this modern technology, so I can't blame him for wanting to move here. You know, Tomoko hasn't been studying lately. She spends all day on the computer in your room. She just doesn't listen to me, no matter how many times I warn her about her grades. Our HQ has moved to the South Parking Garage in Shibahama. Spookies, assemble.                     - Spooky Oh, hi, {FF81}. I'm borrowing the PC to play Paradigm X. Sorry, {FF81}, I'm at a good part. Just a little longer, okay? Oh, {FF81}, you're home? I'm using the PC. That's okay, right? I'm really liking the VR Art Museum in Paradigm X. Sometimes, I think... ""If only I could paint pictures like these."" Oh, {FF81}, welcome back. I was just wanting to ask you about something. Oh, what was it...? I'm not good at remembering these techie words... Oh, right! Servers! Oh, that's right. Hahaha! I'm getting old. I'd forget my head if it wasn't attached. Oh, I see. You really are a sharp kid. Right, honey? This city is full of all the latest gadgets, but I can't use any of them, so I don't care much about it. Of course, your father just loves all this modern technology, so I can't blame him for wanting to move here. If only I was a little younger, I might be able to enjoy it more. Walking around Paradigm X is like walking around in a real town, isn't it? I like being in the city, but I'd like to see a part where you could explore the ocean. You could be friends with cute little fish and dolphins, and play with them, and... Tomoko, get off the computer. Don't you have a test you should be studying for? MooooÔ«m, I was just about to! But now you're making me not want to do it. I wish Tomoko would realize that she needs to study more to get into a good high school. Yeah, yeah, I'll study. After this. I'm having trouble dealing with Tomoko. She needs to study, but she just sits at the computer all day. And your father want to play on it too, so he never scolds her. I feel like I'm the only one who cares about her! Why does this family love that computer so much? I don't even want to touch that thing. Whenever you three sit around talking about computers, I feel left out... {FF81}! There's something wrong with Tomoko. She won't respond, no matter what I say. I don't know what's the matter with her. She's in your room right now. Please check on her, would you? ...... Tomoko? Tomoko! ...... It's no use. She's completely unconscious. No... But why...? ...... Tomoko! Tomoko, can you hear me!? It's no use... She's not waking up... It's no good... She doesn't even notice us... What are you looking at? Oh, the PC's running Paradigm X... That's the VR Art Museum. You know, at the movie theater? That means Tomoko must have been playing Paradigm X when this happened. But, wait... I've seen this before... Oh! Why didn't I remember this sooner!? It was you! You were like this! Tomoko looks exactly like you did when you were on your Vision Quests. But still, I have the feeling like I've seen this before... Hmmm... Huh? The PC's been left on. This is... the VR Art Museum in Paradigm X. You know, at the movie theater? That means Tomoko was playing Paradigm X when this happened... Paradigm... X...... Oh! Why didn't I remember this sooner!? It was you! You were like this! Tomoko looks exactly like you did when you were on your Vision Quests. Hang on, are you saying that she's on a Vision Quest? She must be. She must've met Kinap in Paradigm X, like we did. But, if that's the case... Hey, let's go back to HQ. I have an idea. {FF81}? Welcome back... {FF81}, Tomoko's going to be okay, right...? ...... Oh, welcome back! Oh, {FF81}. Thank goodness Tomoko got better. But, you have to hear this. She was so lifeless one moment, then the next she was right back to normal. It was like she just woke up from hypnosis or something. I don't remember anything... Was I that bad? I thought I was just playing in the VR Art Museum... Oh! That's right! Did you run into me at the museum? I feel like you did. I think... Was it next to the dolphin painting? Or... inside it? Haha, I think that's just your imagination. {FF81}'s never even been to the VR Art Museum before. Aw, really? I really think I ran into you, though... That's because you've been playing too many games. You can't even remember what's going on... I don't want you playing that Para-dimex anymore. I know... I've got to study, right? Ugh. I've got to be a humble student... Oh, well. I guess I'll hit the books. ...Really? I thought she was going to throw a tantrum like she always does. I wonder what happened. Was it the hypnosis? Maybe it was for the better... I'm glad that Tomoko's better, but I'm still shocked that something like that happened to our family... Huh? Mr. {FF82}... ...... ......Hm? Ah, oh. Hi, Hitomi... {FF81}... Welcome... Huh? What is he doing? {FF81}, after what happened to Tomoko, I don't think you should use the PC in your house... You're always going out. Why don't you relax at home sometimes? Oh, {FF81}. I'm borrowing one of your study-aid books. Did you like studying when you were in school? I don't think I'll ever start liking it... but I have to try my hardest, right? Welcome back, {FF81}. ...Oh yes. Do you know where your father went? I haven't seen him home in a while. I wonder what happened. Where did your father go? I hope he's not out buying useless gadgets again. {FF81}, after what happened to Tomoko, I don't think you should use the PC in your house... We couldn't use this PC even if we wanted to, since you don't have an ID... {FF81}! Dad's... Dad's...! ...I heard from Tomoko. Your father is rioting at Akane Mall? But... I can't believe that. Is it really him? I mean, your father wouldn't hurt a fly. He's never raised a hand in anger, for as long as I've known him... But for him to act like this, now... sob ...Don't worry. We'll bring him back. Huh? We'll go to the Akane Mall and bring him back. You wait here, Tomoko. What are you saying, Hitomi? What if something happened to you!? ...Your father asked us to make sure you were okay while he's gone. If something were to happen to you... Don't worry, Mrs. {FF82}. I'm actually pretty strong. I don't think I'm going to have any problems. Well... Maybe you don't know this, but I've been taking self-defense classes. So, don't you worry about me. I'll be back without a scratch. Besides, with {FF81} by my side, I'll be just fine. ...Thank you, Hitomi. {FF81}, if you're going to find your father with Hitomi, you'd better keep her safe, you understand? Be careful, you two... {FF81}, please bring Dad back home... {FF81}... Mom's in the back. I think she's crying... Welcome back, {FF81}. Your father is still unconscious... He's not going to be like this forever, is he......? Oh... {FF81} and Hitomi... ...No, I'm not playing Paradigm X. Dad and I both started acting strange while we were playing it, huh. ...Is it me, or is there a voice coming from inside this thing? Like, something moaning... or chanting. It's scary... Welcome home, {FF81}. {FF81}, are you a hacker? ...The police called while you were out. They wanted to know where you are. I don't know about this complicated computer stuff, so I asked Tomoko to explain some of it to me. She said that not all ""hackers"" are bad. You're fighting the people who made me and Dad crazy, aren't you? Somebody as nice as you wouldn't get caught up in something that involves the police if it wasn't for good. Your father and I may not be the best parents... But we don't believe that we raised you to do the wrong things. We believe in you. So you do what you think is right. You might get caught if you stay here too long. We want you to prove your innocence. {FF81}, I believe in you. Good luck, Brother... You're actually kind of cool right now. Welcome back, Brother. Are you okay? The police didn't find you? Mom's with Dad. I told her about you... She said she didn't need to hear it. Welcome home, {FF81}. Have you heard? Something crazy is happening at Nikamimon. So many scary things are going on in this city. What's happened to this place...? I have faith that the city will return to normal, and that Dad will get better. Right, Brother? GRRRRRR... Huh!? What's with this guy? GRRRRRRR... NEMISSA... I HAVE FOUND YOU...... You know me? WITH THIS BODY OF STEEL... I WILL DEFEAT YOU...... This presence... I... I know you! You're... Moowis!? Moowis... That's the demon that possessed me at the Astro Museum? I thought he ran off, but I didn't think he was going to build himself a body like that. But how do you know Nemissa!? NEMISSA... I DID NOT THINK YOU WOULD BE HERE... A THREAT TO US... IF ONLY YOU DIDN'T EXIST... I-IT CAN'T BE... YOU ARE MUCH STRONGER THAN BEFORE... CURSE YOU... YOU MUST BE DESTROYED. YOU WILL BECOME A THREAT TO MY MASTER... A THREAT TO US... He ran away!? We were so close! But how does that demon know you, Nemissa? He must have something to do with those guys who locked me up. That has to be it. Finally, a lead! I'm going to get him, no matter what. Let's go, {FF81}. Hold on. Where do you plan to go catch him? Take a look over there first. There? Hm? There's something on the ground... What is it? It has to be a part that fell off of Moowis's body. It could be a clue to where he is. Oh, I see. You're smart, Hitomi. Let's go show it to the other Spookies. ...So, a demon dropped this? It's a demon that can possess things. That was part of its body. So if we find where this part came from, we might find where the demon is staying... I see. But I don't know what this is. I'm sorry. Hey, look. There's a mark here. Oh, I recognize this mark. It's a manufacturer's logo for the machines in the Leon Automotive Company. ""Leon Automotive""... So he has to be hiding there? All right, I won't let him escape this time. {FF81}, let's go. Whoa, whoa, whoa. You're going to rush into a den of demons? Just the two of you? That Moowis knew me. He has to know something more. I'm gonna grab him and make him tell me what he knows. But if there are demons there, then the Phantom Society may not be too far away. It'll be dangerous for just the two of you alone. We'll go, too. All right! I've always wanted to see a real demon! Are you dense? You only say that because you've never seen one. We can still help, even if we can't handle demons. Right. We may not be able to fight directly, but we can provide support. We can't let you two do all the work. The Leon Auto Plant is on the west side of Yurashima. Let's go. What're you doing? Let's get going. You have no new messages. There is no new information on Summoner Net. Big Sister... I can't sleep... Huh? Who are you? It's already nighttime... Are you ghosts? Is this Six when he was a kid? He was a cute little guy, huh. Who's Six? My name's Shingo. What are you doing here? You're not bad guys, are you? Aww. I wish I could keep him. What should we do, {FF81}? If we take him back with us, maybe Six'll return to normal. Nuh-uh! You're not taking me anywhere! I'm not going! You're trying to take me to the Night Kingdom, just like that monster does! Nooooo! Help me, Big Sister! Heeeelp! What's wrong, Shingo? You shouldn't be yelling this late at night. If you're not a good boy, the giant bug Goggie will come and eat your head! Now, you go to sleep. Your sister will protect you. I won't let anyone take you away... Huh, so you're not bad guys? Thank goodness. I know! Tell me a story. Something fun. But nothing scary, all right? Otherwise I won't be able to get out of bed to go to the bathroom during the night. What's wrong, Shingo? You need to go to sleep, or Mom will get mad at you. You!? What are you here for? Shingo, you know better than to talk to strangers. Now, let's go... Ohhh! You're back? You can't come in here. This is a secret base for me and Big Sister. What should we do, {FF81}? We need to bring him back... Huh? What's wrong? ...Are you taking me away? I don't wanna go. I don't wanna leave here... I knew it! You're bad guys! You're trying to kidnap me! I don't wanna go! Sister, help! What is this Shingo!? Are you making a fuss again? If you don't quiet down, the dwarf Lukoje will come and blind you! Who are you? Are you trying to take Shingo away? Don't worry, Shingo. Your big sister will make sure you're safe from these bad people... Oh, good. You're not going to do anything to me? Um, it's an airsoft gun my Dad bought me. It even fires real pellets. Let's see... how do I make it work...? Ah, there you are, Shingo. Huh? You people again? Hmmmm... Shingo, you're not supposed to let strangers in here. Now, let's go... sniff sniff sob I broke it... It broke... I broke the doll...... sob What should I do? What can I do...? The blood won't stop... It keeps gushing out, even when I press on it... ...Blood? The doll's bleeding? It's going to die... The doll's gonna die... It's all my fault... This is getting crazy, {FF81}. We need to do something or Six is going to... ...They're going to arrest me for murder. Then I'll be all alone... No... I don't wanna be alone... W-Waaaaaah...! Why are you crying, Shingo? That voice... It's that little girl... If you keep crying, the monster Bugs will come and take you away. sniff sniff I'm sorry, Big Sis. I broke your doll... No... No, I didn't break a doll! We were playing around, and I... I pushed... and Big Sister fell down the stairs... Ahhhhh, nooo... I'm sorry, Sister... After all, your sister now has a body that cannot die. Now, let's go. There are people here who want to take you away... ...No, I didn't break a doll. It... It was Big Sister... W-We... I was playing around, and I... I pushed, and she fell down the stairs... Oh, there's no helping you, huh. What's wrong, Shingo? That voice... It's that little girl... Sister... Big Sister, are you there? Haha... Are you surprised? I'm here because I made you a promise. I promised you that your big sister would always be by your side... Now, let's go play in the back. There are scary people here... You're so mean, Shingo. You've forgotten me all this time. ...... You'd always tell me that you were gonna be with me forever. And yet, you've completely forgotten about Erika. I feel betrayed. I guess humans just forget about people once they're dead. That's... not true. It's all a lie. You're the one who locked me away. I was in your heart all this time, in a place where no light could reach me... But it's okay now. Because now, Shingo and Erika will be together again... forever. But... This isn't the real world, and Sister... isn't really alive... That's not true. I can live in this world. You just don't know it yet. Plus, I'm the only person who knows your true heart. You may act tough, but you're actually scared and lonely on the inside... But as long as you're here, you don't have to pretend anymore. ...Who's there? You've come to take Shingo back, haven't you? I'm not going to let you have him. Shingo is going to stay here with me forever! What should we do, {FF81}? She might be a ghost, but she's Six's sister... No, she's not. She's nothing like that. I can tell. She's a... fabricated ghost. A demon, the memories in his heart that have been twisted and changed. Wait, that's what the guide said... The memories in Six's heart created a demon that appeared here in this world... If I eliminate you here, Shingo will be mine. ...Shingo, you stay here. Your big sister will protect you. I won't let you have Shingo! Come, terrors of the night! Goggie! Lukoje! Bugs! No one's coming... They've all been done in by the sound of the heart... I see... I'm alone. But I still won't let you have Shingo. I'm glad you came, Goggie. Bite them to pieces, okay? Lukoje and Bugs aren't coming... They've been done in by the sound of the heart...... Now, let's go. I won't let you have Shingo! I'm glad you came, Lukoje. Steal their vision, okay? Goggie and Bugs aren't coming... They've been done in by the sound of the heart... Now, let's go. I won't let you have Shingo! I'm glad you came, Bugs. Envelop them in darkness, okay? Goggie and Lukoje aren't coming... They've been done in by the sound of the heart... Now, let's go. I won't let you have Shingo!  I'm glad you came, Goggie, Lukoje. Goggie, bite them to pieces. Lukoje, steal their sight. Bugs isn't coming... He's been done in by the sound of the heart... Now, let's go. I won't let you have Shingo! I'm glad you came, Goggie, Bugs. Goggie, bite them to pieces. Bugs, envelop them in darkness. Lukoje isn't coming... He's been done in by the sound of the heart... Now, let's go. I won't let you have Shingo! I'm glad you came, Lukoje, Bugs. Lukoje, steal their sight. Bugs, envelop them in darkness. Goggie isn't coming... He's been done in by the sound of the heart... Now, let's go. I won't let you have Shingo! I'm glad you all came, Goggie, Lukoje, Bugs. Goggie, bite them to pieces. Lukoje, steal their sight. Bugs, envelop them in darkness. Now, let's go. I won't let you have Shingo! I... I forgot about my sister. All this time... I did such a horrible thing to her... and yet... ...... Hey Six, can you hear me? Huh? Who's there...? ...... Your sister might not be in this world anymore, but she's still in your heart, right? But... I killed...... What we saw of your sister just now was really scary, but that's because your heart has the wrong image of her... You don't have to think about her all the time, but if you reminisce about her once in a while, she'll return to normal. She'll be back... the real sister, who was always so kind to you... Right? ...You're right. I should think about her more often... Yeah...... Thanks, man. Phew... I'm glad it worked out. But I'm kind of surprised. Six never seemed like he was suffering to us... Hmm? Do you have something to share, Hitomi? A memory you don't want to remember? ...A memory? My... past? Huh...? Wait...? What's wrong? I don't know... I... I-I'm sorry. I just got confused all of a sudden. Maybe I'm just tired. Well, hang in there. Geez. Anyway, let's go check on Six. He should be waking up about now. It was a sad memory... I hope he isn't depressed... ""Welcome to Paradigm X!"" Let's go, {FF81}. You have no new messages. There is no new information on Summoner Net. beautiful melody. beautiful melody. beautiful melody. Welcome... I shall help you, drifter in this cyber world... What is this place? Who are you? ...... If you wish, I shall secure this memory in the rifts of the cyber world... What's with this place...? That voice is just repeating itself. Welcome... If you wish, I shall secure this memory in the rifts of the cyber world... Then go... Ahhhh... Guuuuuhh... It's here... soul... come... don't come... ahhhhhhh... ...souls... give me souls... yours... give me... disgusting, beautiful... power, power... gaaaaaah... Wh-What is that thing...?

I... guh... give me your soul... you will become... Omphalos... Whew... That was pretty unpleasant, wasn't it? Did I get any on me? I get the feeling like this Omphalos thing is more than just a program gone bad... Because it was going after souls, right? Maybe that's why. Demons want souls, the Phantom Society wants souls, humans have souls, souls are spirits... I wonder what this means? Maybe it's some kind of energy source... Congratulations! You have answered all the questions correctly and are now a certified Quiz King! {FF82}, you've also been put into the running for the title of Grand Quiz Overlord. The final results will be broadcast on the Air Vision blimp, so keep your eyes on the skies! Thank you for your participation. Now, I bid you farewell... Too bad! I hope you try your mind again! I saw a lot of effort and friendship, but you were still soundly defeated... Thank you for your participation. Please come back again. Hello. Welcome to the Amami Net terminal. You have 1 new message. Æ¸Æ»Æ¤ Æ¸Æ»Æ¤Æ¸Æ»Æ¤  ÆªÕ Æ³È¦ÈÈ¨エエエÆ¹ ェパÔィ Æ­Æ·ÆプÆ« ィÆ¤È Æ¸Æ¢エ  There are no new messages. Thank you for using this terminal. accessed at this time.  Huh? We sure got a lot of guests in here today. {FF81}... Who is this? Could he know where Leader is? ""Leader""? Is that the guy who was here earlier? So, you're the ones he called! Hey, that saves me the trouble of having to go look for you. Everything's goin' Carol J's way today! You already know about demons, so I can't just let you live. You did manage to get past all of mine, though... Oh, so you were the one controlling all the demons here? Tell us where Leader is! Good question. Maybe he's alive, maybe not. So, who are you guys? Your boyfriend looks like a Summoner, but I've never seen your faces at the Phantom Society. A Summoner? You mean {FF81}? Who else would I be talking about? You have a COMP, so you've gotta be a Summoner! Buuuuuuut... If you're a Summoner, and you're not in the Phantom Society, I gotta put you down. Let's rock! What a loudmouth. If you're picking a fight with us, I'm not going to hold back! Ugh... Wh-What the hell...!? The guy, okay, but how is this chick so rockin'!? Tch! Consider yourselves lucky! I'm lettin' you off easy today, but I'll be back! He never shut up until it was all over...! Huh, he dropped something. What is this? I wonder what this is... H-Hang on. This looks like a note. Let's see... ""WEFW\++PPP7JSW+3ER4+ZA+TQ\"" Is this a code? I don't know what this card's for, either. We should ask the others about these later. They might be able to tell us something about them. Huh!? Hitomi! And {FF80}, too!? Leader! You're all right! Y-Yeah. Did you two come to save me? Something like that. I'm disappointed that it was so easy, though. But, still, how did-- The gun-type PC! Did you get it working!? It's, uh... A-Anyway, why don't we get out of here? Lunch and Six are here, too. Yeah... Yeah, you're right. We shouldn't stick around. Let's go. Leader! You're safe! That's a relief. Hot damn, you're alive? I thought you were eaten by monsters for sure... I'll admit, it was a close call... But {FF80} and Hitomi stepped in and saved me. H-Hey, I helped, don't forget. I was taking those monsters down, one after an-- We aren't safe here. C'mon, let's get the hell out of this place. We can talk at HQ. ...... Hey, you can't blame me! We were dealing with monsters! ...Leader, why were you at the Algon NS building anyway? I went back to the junk dealer I bought the gun PC from, and asked him where he got it. ...He said that he just found it on the street by the building. I thought it might have fallen from up there... So you snuck into the building just on a hunch? ...Nobody would have thought there'd be demons inside. It was a strange building. It has to be something out of the ordinary. I'm wondering about that ""Phantom Society"" Carol J mentioned. Damn. Demons, Summoners... It's like something straight out of a comic book or a movie. I don't believe it. Hey there, everyone! Sorry to keep you waiting! Yuichi Haga Handle: Yu-Ichi A member of the Spookies. Childish and friendly, he can sometimes be annoying. Six often yells at him. Oh, so this is where we've moved to. Huh? What's with all the serious faces? Oh, look who decides to come waltzing in AFTER we've done all the work! What the hell, Six? What're you so mad about? Huh? Whatcha got there, {FF80}?  Some kind of fancy gun? Suh-weet! Lemme see, lemme see! You can touch it, but don't you dare point it at me unless you want a faceslap! Whoa, what happened to you, Hitomi? You look so different. ...Yo, I deciphered the code that was on that note. You did? Nice! What about the card? It's a license card for something, but that's all I know. The note is where the real treasure is. The code was a web address. Feast your peepers on this, people: ""Summoner Net""! To all the glorious Summoners gathered within the auspices of the Phantom Society: Our project is finally underway.

Never forget the failure at Amami Airport. It is currently unknown if the recent reports of a strange disease in Amami City are linked to us. ...And here's the latest posting, from three days ago. Notice: Urabe, the man who betrayed and eluded us, has been dealt with. We are currently investigating what events led to his being found on the roof of the Algon NS facility. So, what the hell's up with these guys...? This isn't normal. What're we gonna do? The Phantom Society... That's the group Carol J mentioned. Ha ha... Ha ha ha... This is big. I never thought we'd find a secret like this hidden beneath the gleaming facade of this supposed near-utopia. You were about to be killed a few minutes ago, and you're already laughing... N-Now hold on a sec. You don't plan on messing with them again, do you? What, are you scared? Chicken! Chiiiiick-ennnnnn! Wha--!? W-Well, what about you, Hitomi!? I'm fine. Heck, sounds like it'll be fun. If we hurry up and chase them, we might be able to get some real information out of them. R-Really...? W-Well... I don't want to have to worry about you guys. I'll come, too. Then it's decided. Our only clues right now are Summoner Net and the COMP... H-Hey! What's that sound!? I-I dunno, it just started beeping all of a sudden... Is that the COMP? Don't tell me you broke it... Lay off! It just started beeping for no reason! Give me that thing! Ugh, it's getting on my nerves. {FF81}, do something! Hey! It stopped when {FF80} touched it. Maybe it has a fingerprint reader or something? It says ""ERROR"" on the screen... Let's see what the detailed error report says... ""GO TO GOUMADEN"" ...Goumaden? I've heard that name somewhere before... Oh! It's the cruise ship chained up in the harbor. The Hotel Goumaden. But does that boat have anything to do with this COMP? We're going to have to find that out. I think we'll be needing a working COMP soon enough. {FF80}, you're the one who can make that COMP work. I want you to go to the Goumaden and see what's up. Isn't that dangerous? If it's something to do with that COMP, it can't be normal. That's exactly why I want {FF80} on this job. Only he can fight the demons. I'm going with him. This sounds like it'll be fun. Huh? But, Hitomi, it's going to be dangerous... I said I'm going, and I'm going! This place is boring as hell. You have a problem with that? O-Okay, then... Just... Be careful. Wait, let me give you the license card, too. Maybe it'll be useful somehow. All right, {FF81}, let's get going. To the Goumaden cruise ship! You have no new messages. To all the glorious Summoners gathered within the auspices of the Phantom Society: Our project is finally underway.

No need to respond. Bye. There are no new messages. Thank you for using this terminal. {FF80}! Hitomi, too! You came to save me? You're such a klutz. Are you okay? Yeah, I guess... Did Leader tell you to do this? ...Y-Y'know, I've had time to cool off and think about things while I've been locked in here. Ratting us out and locking us up doesn't make sense, does it... You finally get it! It wasn't Leader. You see... Okay... So, Yu-Ichi... Crap, I can't believe myself! Is Leader being held somewhere in here, too? That's right. I thought you might all be held together, but... So you haven't rescued him or Six, then? Dammit! If only I'd believed Leader... ...It's not too late to start. Let's work together and find the others. All right. We need to find Leader and save him, no matter what. Let's see... {FF80}, I know it's dangerous, but we don't have time. Let's split up. I'll look around the L tower and contact you if I find anything. You check the other areas. Okay. Come on, {FF81}, let's go. {FF80}! Hitomi, too! You came to save me? You're such a klutz. Are you okay? Yeah, I guess... Did Leader tell you to do this? ...Y-Y'know, I've had time to cool off and think about things while I've been locked in here.

Is Leader being held somewhere in here, too? That's right. We've already rescued Six. He's investigating the R tower now. Dammit! If only I'd believed Leader... ...It's not too late to start. Let's all work together and find him. All right. We need to find Leader and save him, no matter what. Let's see... If you've got Six checking out the R tower, then I'll look around here in the L tower. You guys go see if you can find anything suspicious. I'll call you if I find anything. ...Okay. {FF81}, let's start looking elsewhere. ...Huh? {FF80}! Hitomi! What are you doing here!? What do you think? We're here to rescue you! Yeah? But why!? You've got no reason to help me now! You dumbass! We come all this way to free you, and that's all you have to say! Listen, Leader's not the one who tricked you. The truth is... ...It was Yu-Ichi? Then that mail from Kadokura was all a hoax? Exactly. You fell for the enemy's plan, hook, line, and sinker. Dammit! I shoulda had faith in Leader... It's not all lost yet. We're not too late. We can still save Leader and Lunch. You're right. I can't leave things like this! But still... If we stay together, it'll take too long... I'll investigate the Monolith's R tower. {FF80}, Hitomi, can you guys check out the other places? I want those two saved as soon as we can. That's okay with you, right? ...Yeah. All right. I'll let you know if I find anything. I'm counting on you. ...Huh? {FF80}! Hitomi! What are you doing here!? What do you think? We're here to rescue you! Yeah? But why!? You've got no reason to help me now! You dumbass! We come all this way to free you, and that's all you have to say! Listen, Leader's not the one who tricked you. The truth is... ...It was Yu-Ichi?

We've already rescued Lunch, and he's looking around in the L tower right now. If you want to save Leader... Of course! I won't let it end like this! ...If Lunch is checking out the L tower, I'll take the R tower. You guys look around for anything that seems funny. ...Yeah. All right. I'll let you know if I find anything. I'm counting on you. Ugh... Wh-Who are you...? H-Hey, this guy's Kadokura. Hah. I've been waiting to meet you. How dare you make fools of us! Where is Leader? I... I see. You're from... Spookies... You made it, then... Made it... this far... Wh-What's wrong with him? Does he have a headache or something? Like I care. Let's start beating him until he talks. Wh-Why...? What makes people like this appear...? Why do my ideas crumble...? This is not what I wanted my network to bring to the world... What are you yapping about? You're the one who made that system that sucks out people's souls! My network... It was meant to be a place for people to communicate, to bring the world together... But... Ha ha, haha... Look at the reality... It simply digitized the dark side of man, and filled minds with lies. It caused the psychological decline of culture that denies the very existence of truth. And in the end... Ha ha ha... it even became a weapon... to take people's lives... I-I-I... Ha... I didn't mean any of this... Wh-What is wrong with him? Dude, are you okay? I... I'm sorry... I shouldn't have... created this horror... B-But... Nishi... Nishi tricked me... and this is how it ends... Nishi? As in the Vice Minister? It was him... He's a member of the Phantom Society... and the mastermind behind this project... He's on the upper floor of this central section. I'll unlock the door... Please... He has to be stopped... Hey, what should we do with him? There's no point in dealing with him if he doesn't put up a fight. Saving Leader's our top priority. ""Leader..."" Are you talking about Sakurai? You know something? I'm sure it was Nishi that lured you here... He, of all people, would know where Sakurai is held. Why don't we pay Nishi a visit, then? That'd be the quickest way. Yeah... All right, let's go. ...... Aaa-aaaaagh... It hurts... I-I... aaaaaaaagh... Kadokura's gone...! Where'd he go? Ha ha ha... Today is a day of splendor. You could call it... the start of our new future. Welcome, members of Spookies. This is the first time we have met, but is there really a need for introductions? I didn't think you were the one behind this stupid scheme, Vice Minister Nishi. This entire city was your plan! Ha. It is far more than some ""stupid scheme."" We are carrying out mankind's duty. What duty? Stealing souls? You're saying that's what we're here for? In the end, humans are but vessels. This city is bait to draw them together and expand the network. And what are you going to do now? Soon, with the antenna on this building's roof, we will begin to operate Paradigm X on a worldwide scale. Then, the number of souls we collect will grow at a simply unfathomable rate. You bastard! You're going to spread your disease all over the world!? Why? What are you going to do with so many human souls!? They will be offered to our Master... No... Not simply ""our"" Master, but the master of all. Tch, this guy's nuts! Listening to him's a waste of time. You cannot deny that we have collected a great many souls. With Manitou's help, it will be even easier. What is this ""Manitou""!? What's it got to do with Nemissa!? Nemissa? How do you know about Nemissa? I'M Nemissa! Now tell me what you know! Hitomi, what are you saying? Nemissa? You're Nemissa!? Hahahahaha! Of all the luck! The one factor of uncertainty, the missing piece that we thought had been lost forever... ...And you come right to us! This really is a great day. I have no more need to feign humanity. Your souls will be offered to my Master. Hahahahahaha! I am Azazel, testimony to darkness, and its king! Holy-! Looks like he's not gonna tell us where Leader is...! {FF80}, Hitomi, we'll leave him to you! We're going to the roof to destroy that antenna! We'll tear him to pieces! Be careful! ...Foolish humans. I will tell you what the Phantom Society is before you die. We are the ones who created you and what you call history. Mankind are mere chattel, created and raised by us... You created us!? Get real! Humanity's history is based on our free will! No one controls us! The conceit that keeps you from accepting that others have power over you is proof of your human foolishness. We have tolerated your ignorance and your insolence, but no more. The time has come. Your souls must be collected. For the sake of our coming Master... Enough. You will be destroyed in every way it is possible to be destroyed, and your souls thrown to Manitou. Ha... Young Summoner, and... black witch... So you were the ones who defeated Shemyaza. Very well. It has been far too long since I used this form in battle. This will be a worthy battle. Urgh...... I-I lost...? To... mere beasts... It's over, Azazel! For both you and your scheme! ...Ah... Ahahaha... Do you really think you've won!? Do you think our plans have truly been halted? ...You merely thrash against the bars of your cage... The Phantom Society is everlasting. We are with the Master of all... This is not the end... Know that my death is only the beginning of a never- ending battle. Hahaha... Ahahahaaa! ...Azazel knew about Nemissa, too. He said I was a ""factor of uncertainty..."" What I don't know about myself... and... Manitou... What would Hitomi say at a time like this... ...I'm sorry. I know this is all my fault... Anyway, let's get to the roof. Aren't you worried about Lunch and Six? Whoa... Ooh, Hitomi, {FF80}. You guys okay? Did you guys do this? Not bad! Heh heh, yeah. The Phantom Society's plans are down the drain! Hey, we can't celebrate just yet. We need to find Leader. Let's surprise him with our success. You defeated Nishi? L-Leader! What, you're all right!? ...... Check it out, Leader. Phantom's plans are completely crushed. We won. ...... Uh, Leader? What's wrong? You're not happy? Well... Er... You still angry at us? You know... for... Hey, we're not gonna make excuses. I'm sorry. We should've had more faith in you. ...Don't worry about it. I'm actually very happy. Because... heh... Because now, I... Heh ha ha... I can kill you myself! Ahahaha! L-Leader!? What's wrong with you!? Shemyaza and Azazel have fallen, and only I remain. But, I'm fine with that. As long as I have Manitou, I can collect souls. Even better, I can have the winnings all to myself. H-Hey! Leader, what're you talking about!? You... You're not Leader. Who are you? Huh? Hitomi... {FF80}, too? What's wrong, everybody? What am I--! Wha--M-My body's... Urrrgh! So there you have it. You should thank me for being merciful enough to allow you to die by your friend's hand. Hahaha! What the hell's going on!? Isn't that Leader!? What the--!? He isn't Leader!? No... He's been possessed by a demon... Get back to HQ, you guys. We'll deal with him. What do you mean, ""deal with him""? What're you gonna do to him!? We're gonna save him. ...I just don't know how. Just go! ...O-Okay. Please, save Leader for us. Let's go, Six! Tch... Why do we have to be so powerless when it's so important... Sorry, but we've got to count on you! Hee hee! You plan to beat me, Satanael? Ha, that's a good one. Do you think you're up to it? Can pathetic humans like you kill this man? We can save Leader, {FF81}. We can't let that demon do whatever it wants with him... Ugh...... Ughhh...... Leader, can you hear me? I... Ah, I see... The two of you stopped me...... Sorry about that. Ha... Haha... How pathetic... Letting myself get taken over... cough cough L-Leader... I... It's okay... I wanted it... this way... It's better than hurting you... I'm sorry... This was... the only thing I could do... But, it's funny... Only now, do I know my own heart... I was jealous of Kadokura's skill, but I pretended not to see it by hiding in my own little hacker world, Spookies. This was all for the better. You saved me...... Urgh... cough cough Leader! No... Hitomi! Hitomi! Please, come out. Leader's... Leader's dying...... Hitomi! ...Leader? I see... It happened... to you, too... Hitomi... I-I... Leader... Leader... I can't... remember who you are... No...! I know you... You're someone I know very well...! Why can't I remember who you are!? ...{FF80}... Save Hitomi... for me... And also... the girl... who's crying behind her... ......It'll be okay... I know you can do it... ...I feel better now... I... I'm tired... Let me sleep... Just for a little while... Huh!? No... No, don't die! Leader... Leader! Please don't die! Leader! Hitomi's... she's not coming out anymore... We stopped their plan, but with everything that's happened... Wh-What is this!? What happened to the antenna!? You! I can't collect souls like this! The Carriers can't come back! Was it you who destroyed it!? Wait, why are you talking about collecting souls? All you had to do was kill Azazel and Satanael! But this... Damn you! You were using us? You're not part of the Phantom Society! Why do you want to collect souls!? Manitou wants them. More and more souls! But, now that it has come to this, I'm done with you. I'll banish you to the digital world! What!? Who are you!? Goodbye, Nemissa, you alma of death born from Manitou! Ugh...... Ughhh...... Leader, can you hear me? I... Ah, I see... The two of you stopped me...... Sorry about that. Ha... Haha... How pathetic... Letting myself get taken over... cough cough Don't try to talk, you'll hurt yourself even worse. Don't worry, you're going to be safe. I promised everyone that we'd come home with you. I know you'll pull through. Lunch, Six, Yu-Ichi... They're all waiting for you. So have faith in us, and don't strain yourself. ...Gotcha. I can't go... making you a liar... Then... I'll take a... nap... He's breathing steadily. He'll be all right. If we take him to HQ, we can get him some medical care in time to save him. Let's hurry, {FF81}! Wh-What is this!? What happened to the antenna!? You! I can't collect souls like this! The Carriers can't come back! Was it you who destroyed it!? Wait, why are you talking about collecting souls? All you had to do was kill Azazel and Satanael! But this... Damn you! You were using us? You're not part of the Phantom Society! Why do you want to collect souls!? Manitou wants them. More and more souls! But, now that it has come to this, I'm done with you. I'll banish you to the digital world! What!? Who are you!? Goodbye, Nemissa, you alma of death born from Manitou! ...... ......You're all right now. You can open your eyes. This is the world that lives on inside of me, inside your mother's embrace. The world once sang us a song, and she quietly took me in. That is why we never forgot. The great voice of the land... Its sacredness, and its gentleness... However, as the years passed, man forgot how to hear the land's song. We became rootless. The calamity that has come to this world is something that humanity has beckoned. I am Kinap, the last ember of the spirits of those who lived in harmony with the land. This is the last time I will speak to you. I shall tell you of my memory. It was I who sealed Manitou away, so that a calamity such as this could never happen again. Manitou itself is like a stone. It has no soul, no self. It is... a pure spirit, infinitely pure. But purity without a self is like a river that never bends: if man tries to intervene, it rages. That is why I attempted to give all of myself to the mother land. Just as she did me, I thought I could contain Manitou. But, Manitou had already met humanity. And it learned of madness. My voice can no longer reach it. In order to stop Manitou, it must be destroyed. There is no other way. However, it does not know ruin. It does not know that just as all life awakens to song, all life ends with song. In order to destroy Manitou, it must learn the song of death. And the one who knows this song... is Nemissa. The memory within her has already been awakened. When you awaken, she will have found her path. {FF82}, death is something possessed by all life. When it happens, it is because it is supposed to happen. But it is not sadness that surrounds death. It is a celebration of the cycle of life and death turning once more. Please, save Manitou. I am Kinap, a man who became a spirit to watch over Manitou since ancient times. The world once sang us a song, and she quietly took me in. That is why we never forgot. The great voice of the land... Its sacredness, and its gentleness... However, as the years passed, man forgot how to hear the land's song. We became rootless. The calamity that has come to this world is something that humanity has beckoned. I am Kinap, the last ember of the spirits of those who lived in harmony with the land. {FF82}, you stand at the very balance between life and death. A common man would already have fallen into the land of the dead. But the strength in your heart lets you stay. Father, mother, siblings, friends, lovers... The feelings of those around you are the power one needs to live. When I see you, I see...  myself, in my own tribe, long ago. We turned our emotions in life into song, so that we did not feel regret, not even when someone dies. The Song of Death is what we would sing at the end of a life, but it is also a song for when one must be strongest. ...There will come a time when you will sing that song. But now is not that time. The one who should be singing it is Manitou, for the meaning of life has become lost to it. Manitou, has been defiled by the souls of humans who also do not know death. This cannot be reversed... But, if it can sing the Song of Death, it can be stopped. And the one who knows this song... is Nemissa. The memory within her has already been awakened. When you awaken, she will have found her path. ...My words end here. Without a body, I can only trust that you will be able to do what must be done. I am Kinap, a man who became a spirit to watch over Manitou since ancient times. That was Kinap's true form... Or more like, what he looked like when he was human... He opened the door to my memory. And he told me my past. Manitou is my... parent, for lack of a better word. Kinap split Nemissa from Manitou in order to destroy it. Because only I can destroy Manitou... It makes sense why Moowis would attack me. He was also a demon born from Manitou. And not just Moowis. Winpe at the airport, Malsum at Algon Soft... All of them were demons born from Manitou. Of course, the Phantom Society didn't want them to appear. They all sprang forth from Manitou as it went mad... Endlessly hungering for souls... and attacking anything that could threaten Manitou... The Phantom Society can't control Manitou any longer. But Manitou can't control itself, either... It will only continue to devour souls until it goes on a never-ending rampage. We have to hurry and stop it... ...... Heh. Do you think it's weird that I'm saying something like this? Me, too. I'm just so calm... It's like something has been lifted from my shoulders. But my thoughts are clear: this is the best solution. You think so too, don't you? This is something that only those of us who are living can do. Now let's go back to HQ. ...We need to inform everybody about Leader...... That was Kinap's true form... Or more like, what he looked like when he was human... He opened the door to my memory.

Now let's go back to HQ... ...This is a joke, right!? Leader's... This can't be happening! ...... I'm sorry... We couldn't... We had to... To hell with you! You had to do it!? You had to kill-- Six... It's not {FF80} and Hitomi's fault... ...I'm sorry. I don't mean to blame you. I-It's just...! Spooooooookyyyyyy! I'm so sorry! If only... I-If only I hadn't been b-b-brainw-washed! Dammit... I thought we were able to finally crush their plans... But Kadokura was behind it all... What're we gonna do? We can't back down now! We've got to avenge Leader! We interrupt the scheduled broadcast to bring you breaking news. The Amami Monolith in Nikamimon has been coated in an unknown material. ...And we have just received new footage. The material has yet to be identified, and the police have issued a statement to the following effect: ""Due to the unpredictability of the situation, the entire ward of Nikamimon will be closed."" The chief of police... What the hell is this? This that ""Manitou"" Hitomi was talking about? That thing... Hey, look at that! What's that on the roof? ...An antenna? It looks like an antenna. What!? But we just destroyed that giant antenna right around where that thing is...! Then, that weird material's being used to replace the antenna? It's Kadokura! He's still there. He hasn't given up! He's got balls, to pull this stunt. Let's crash his party and stop him once and for all! But the whole area's been blocked off. We won't be able to get inside the building. What'll we do? ......I'll ask Dad for help. He has influence within the company. You're gonna ask your dad!? Are you sure about this? Yeah... I'll call him right now. Hold on. ...Okay. He'll meet us in front of Algon Microelectronics. He said he has something to tell us, too. We should get a move on, then. Let's go, {FF80}. We were able to make it back. We need to hurry and rescue Leader... You don't need to worry. We saved him. Yu-Ichi... and you're... He begged me to take him to the Monolith, so I did. We were on our way to the roof after hearing that explosion... and we found him there, unconscious. ...... How is he!? I can't really say. Physically, he should be able to recover, but... ""But""? I can't say the same for what remains of his consciousness... or what you might call his ""soul"". Soul... ...We'll look after him. You have your own mission to complete. I'll be going now. If his condition changes, I'll contact you. Good luck, all of you. ...We're not out of the woods, but there's still hope... Thank goodness. ...I see. Leader's...... It's not the worst-case scenario, but we can't rest just yet, huh... I'm sorry, everyone... If only... If only I didn't go and get captured... What're you saying, man? Without you, Leader might not have been rescued. Yeah. You did well... for you, anyway. Still... I thought we were finally able to crush their plans... But Kadokura was behind it all... What're we gonna do? We can't back down now! They're gonna pay for what they did to Leader! ""Welcome to Paradigm X!"" There is new information on Summoner Net. You have no new messages. There is no new information on Summoner Net. Hey, {FF81}.

Unlocking the R20F express elevator. We've got a connection to Central Room 1-L and Central Station, and access to the upper levels. All you need is to enter the password for over on the right side... the password's ""FLY"". ...It looks like both passcodes have been entered. Now for the two upper codes. ""PIXY"" here and ""TWIN"" there. Just a little more... Let's do this for Leader, {FF80}. Yo, {FF80}! Great timing! I just got a call from Lunch and unlocked all the rooms in Tower R. You should be able to get into the rooms that you couldn't enter on the way here. Also, I've managed to dig up the layout of this Monolith. Listen up. Obviously, it's split into two large towers. Both towers are split at the 20th floor into upper and lower areas. So, there are four sections: L Upper, L Lower, R Upper, and R Lower. And each of these areas has a control room that grants access to the other areas, like the Central Section. We'll need a password for these control rooms in order to do that. It would seem that part of the password is entered on each of the floors, starting from the floor below us. But, there's a problem... I don't know the password. {FF84}Hey Six, can you hear me? Oh, cool, you've got {FF80} with you. I can tell you both at the same time. Pay attention. I found some sort of scrambled code over here. I tried entering it into my decoder. ...And something came up! I'll spare you the details. The keyword is ""The Flying Wizard and the Twin Pixies.""{FF85} ...What the hell's that supposed to mean? Hang on, I'm not done. {FF84}I decoded it a second time. That time, it said TWIN, PIXY, FLY, and WIZ. But I think how they were displayed is the important part. Top-left was TWIN, top right was PIXY, bottom-left FLY, and bottom-right WIZ.{FF85} Hm... Four sections, split by left, right, top, and bottom... Just like the Monolith, huh? {FF84}That's what I was thinking. There should be a place to input those passwords. {FF80}, go look for somewhere you can input them. I'll keep investigating here. I'm counting on you.{FF85} Upper-L TWIN, Upper-R PIXY, Lower-L FLY, Lower-R WIZ, huh... I'll check out this room for a while longer, so you go input those passwords. If you find out anything, I'll be here. We're counting on you, {FF80}. Yo, {FF80}. This place looks pretty suspicious doesn't it? I'm going to check this place out. I'll handle things here, so you go look around elsewhere. What is this place? It looks like a main server room, but we need to find everyone else. Well, here's how it boils down. The Monolith is split into the Left and Right towers, and each tower is split into Upper and Lower levels. Each area has a password, and each floor in that area needs to have part of the password entered somewhere. Once all of the passwords are entered, we should be able to gain access to all the areas and the Central Section. The passwords are: Upper-L: TWIN, Upper-R: PIXY, Lower-L: FLY, Lower-R: WIZ. If you find out anything more about these passwords, come back here. area is ""FLY""... Code accepted. Unlocking the L20F express elevator. We've got a connection to Control Room 1-R and the Central Section, and access to the upper levels... huh. Access to L20F express elevator granted. Access to L20F express elevator, Central Section, and upper levels granted. Hey, {FF80}. The code for above is ""TWIN"". {FF80}, you've entered the code for this side, but not for the other tower. The code should be ""WIZ"". {FF80}, the passcode here is ""FLY"". {FF80}, check it out! It looks like it accepted the passcode! Code accepted. Unlocking the L20F express elevator. We've got a connection to Control Room 1-R and the Central Section, and access to the upper levels... huh. Now for the right side... The magic word is ""WIZ"". ...Looks like both codes have been accepted. The ones you need now are the two upper areas... ""TWIN"" on this side, and ""PIXY"" on the other. Just a little more... Let's do this for Leader's sake, {FF80}. {FF80}! You couldn't have come at a better time! I just unlocked the rooms of the left tower. There were some rooms you couldn't get into, right? They should be open now. I called Six, so if it's the same situation over there, he should have them unlocked, too. Oh, and I think I found a code while I was searching this room. So I ran it through the decrypter, and... Well, check it out. .................. FRVÆ KVCAVÆ JG QANQENÆ MVJTAVÆ LYS .................. seiÆ xiPniÆ wTehT dnAdraÆ ziWgniÆ ylFehT .................. The&*$Flying(j13!Wizard+}<and +kn:the*^h\Twin%b#Pixies There's something there, but there's a lot of junk, too. Let me try changing the decoding parameters... ............ TWINPIXY      FLYWIZ ...... Looks like this is the real message. I'm pretty sure those are passwords, but they'll have to be entered somewhere. {FF84}Hey, Lunch! It's me! Can you hear me? Huh? {FF80}'s there, too? Then listen, both of you. I figured out the Monolith's layout, so I called. Obviously, it's split into two large towers. Both towers are split at the 20th floor into upper and lower areas. So, there are four sections: L Upper, L Lower, R Upper, and R Lower. And each of these areas has a control room that grants access to the other areas, like the Central Section. We'll need a password for these control rooms in order to do that. It would seem that part of the password is entered on each of the floors, starting from the floor below us. But, there's a problem... I don't know the password. You need the passwords? Ha! Let me handle that! {FF80}, with what Six and I have found out, this is what I'm thinking... Each of these four areas Six mentioned is going to need a password. And, this little diagram we have tells us what these passwords are: TWIN and FLY on the left, PIXY and WIZ the right. {FF80}, you go look for someplace where you can input those passwords. If you find out anything, come back here. I'm counting on you. Hey, {FF80}. There has to be something important in this room. I'm going to keep looking. Could you guys go check out someplace else? What is this place? It looks like a main server room, but we need to find everyone else. When we put together what Six and I have found, here's what we think is how this place works: First off, the Monolith is separated into four sections. Upper and lower L Tower, and upper and lower R Tower. Each of these areas has a password, which needs to be entered at the Central Station in order to access them. Apparently, there are devices on each floor that will let you enter part of the password for the area they're in. Upper L is ""TWIN"", Upper R is ""PIXY"", Lower L is ""FLY"", and Lower R is ""WIZ"". If you learn anything else about the passwords, come on back here. Password required. The passcode here is ""PIXY"". Let's hurry. Access to R20F-R39F express elevator granted. Connection with Control Room 2-L established. Access to Central Section granted. {FF84}Hey, {FF80}? I can see from here that all the passcodes have been accepted. I'm going to head up to the Central Section. I'll contact Six as well, so let's meet up there. See you in a bit. Code accepted. Unlocking the R20F-R39F express elevator. Access to R20F-R39F express elevator and Central Section granted. Password required. The passcode over here was ""TWIN"", right? Access to L20F-L39F express elevator granted. Connection with Control Room 2-R established. Access to Central Section granted. {FF84}Hey, {FF80}? I can see from here that all the passcodes have been accepted. I'm going to head up to the Central Section. I'll contact Six as well, so let's meet up there. See you in a bit. Code accepted. Unlocking the L20F-L39F express elevator. Access to L20F-L39F express elevator and Central Section granted. Man, no matter how many times I look at it, I'm always surprised by how big this place is. Is Leader really here? We don't have time to turn over every rock looking for him, and we can't afford to get caught ourselves... What should we do...? What are you muttering about? What a pain. Fine, I'll go on ahead. Hey! Don't go walking off on your own! I'm no good at sitting here and thinking! Besides, I don't have to take orders from you! Yes, you do! It's my body! {FF81}, help me out here! Hey, uh... You've been acting really weird today, Hitomi. What's wrong? Shut up! None of your business! Look, calm down. You're right that splitting up would be the most efficient plan here. Let's split into pairs, me with Six and {FF80} with Hitomi. Don't do anything stupid. Well, that's what my collection's for. Bwahahahahaha! Honestly, you're the one I'm worried about most. Anyway, you guys be careful. ...Hey, he IS here! Geez, what a pain in the butt! Shhhhh! If he hears you say that, he'll get mad again. We need to be quiet here. ...Hi, Six. Nobody answered the door, so we showed ourselves in. ... ...Are you still upset over what happened at the Amami Float? I do understand why you're so upset... But right now, Spookies is in danger. {FF81}'s ID was deleted... So, can you please forget what happened for now and come back? Please! We need your help! .........Still no? ...... Is he even listening to you? You need to show him who's boss in cases like this. Hey! You! Six! You need to listen to-- ...... It looks like they got to him... What is this? He looks like Tomoko did that one time... Look, I knew it. He's playing Paradigm X. What part was he in? I can't tell... It looks like an old house... Some kind of mansion? ...Come to think of it, we heard about something like this at the movie theater in Paradigm X, didn't we? Six is--well, was--playing the ""VR Haunted Mansion"". All right. If we know the problem, let's go and fix it. ...We can't. Why not? Don't you remember?  {FF81}'s ID is gone. He can't access Paradigm X any more. What should we do? We need to rescue Six... Oh. Well, we should at least tell everyone about Six's condition. Let's go, {FF81}. He's still in that catatonic state. Let's get back to HQ. Stop wasting time here and head back to the HQ. Hey, Six! Snap out of it! Dammit! Why'd he end up like this...? Lunch, check his PC. Maybe somebody's tampered with his machine. Oh, right. {FF80}, leave Six to us for now and go get your ID restored. ...It's no good. There's nothing wrong with the machine. So what the hell is this!? Some new kind of demon attack? I don't have a clue. It's not something in his PC, and if it's the work of demons, then we're stuck here. I really hope it's something simple, like him being hypnotized or something. What do you think we should do? We can keep an eye on Six, so what are you guys... Hahahaha! Hey, guys! I guess I caused you some worry there. You're finally awake? You seriously caused us some problems. Are you okay? I'm still kind of woozy. When I woke up, Lunch's face was right there in front of me... scared the hell outta me. Shut up! You freaked me out WAY more when you started moving out of the blue! Suddenly falling into a coma, jumping right back up with no warning... You don't ever ease into anything, ya know? But, still, I'm glad you're awake. I was afraid you might croak in your sleep or something. At any rate, we're all back to normal. We're going to head back to HQ. What about you, Six? I'll rest some more before I go. I'm still a little groggy. Hey, don't push yourself. We'll see you later, Six. H-Hey. {FF80}, Hitomi. Um...... Thanks. Huh? Er, n-never mind. I just... I just felt like I needed to say that. Oh, you came back at a good time. Lunch and I were just talking about that new disease. I hacked into some local hospital records. It seems there's been a lot of new patients showing the same symptoms. A few of them even started to get violent without warning. I guess Six just got off lucky. It looks like all the patients were playing Paradigm X when they were hit by the disease. Just like Six. I have a feeling that this disease is somehow connected to the Phantom Society. If Paradigm X is the cause, then the disease is limited to people within Amami City. The Phantom Society has plans for this city, and there's a disease that only appears here? It can't be a coincidence! But Algon Soft made Paradigm X. Besides-- Six and Tomoko had their souls stolen by demons... Wait. Is somebody outside!? Ah, I've been discovered. Excuse me, and you are...? Hmhm... I didn't think that your HQ would be a trailer. Locating it took time. I am Mayone. I have come to deal with some particularly loudly buzzing flies. Are you with the Phantom Society? I see... With the project underway, you can't afford to have the secret of Paradigm X revealed now. ...Exactly. You're much deeper into this than I'd first thought. I thought that I would send you out with a glorious bang. But since you discovered me, you ruined my big surprise. Now I shall have to deal with you with my own hands. Oh yeah!? Go ahead and try! N-No... I-I lost... to such... children...? Aw, poor wittle assassin! Looks like it's mission failed for you! Y-You think so...? I shall... complete... m-my mission... There isn't much time left... Will you make it...? Ha... ha ha ha... Are you... Holy crap, you two! Are you always dealing with people like that!? Six, you're back. Sorry for being late. So what just happened...? Hey, over here! She put something over by the fuel tank. Huh? What's this...? Oh crap. It's plastique! It's a bomb! So that's what Mayone meant... Dammit, we've got to get out of the garage. It's too dangerous here. ...Tch, don't sweat it. I've seen this kind of bomb before. I'll disarm it. What're you babbling about!? This is a real bomb we're talking about! You wanna die trying to act cool!? Get out of here, you guys... I'll start to disarm it... Stop it, you idiot! ...All right, everyone wait outside. Six and I will stay behind. H-Hey, Leader... I'll drive this thing a safe distance away. Are you sure you can disarm it? Don't be crazy, you two! You'd better be safe! ...You'd better! I wonder if Six can really deal with that bomb... The Phantom Society's starting their assault on us. That means we're getting close to the truth. Paradigm X... The disease... ...They're late... They should be back by now... ......! Phewwwwwww... That was close... Six, Leader! Thank goodness you're safe. Haha, talk about getting out just in the nick of time... Uh, didn't you say you were gonna disarm it!? Yeah, I tried, but there wasn't enough time. So I ripped it off and we high-tailed it out of there and chucked it. Haha! I knew you couldn't disarm it. But I'm glad you guys made it out. Not bad, for you! I'll tell you, though, I was really sweating! I can't have my trailer blown to bits... I haven't paid it off! Ha ha ha! I say we get a move on to somewhere else. If we're still here when the police show up, we're screwed. Right... I'm wondering how the Phantom Society found where we were. At any rate, we need to move our HQ. Hmmm... This is a big warehouse... I considered using this place for the last move, too. I need to let Yu-Ichi know... Let's get inside. I'll text Yu-Ichi the new location. I'll go research Paradigm X, then. Paradigm X? What about Paradigm X? I'll explain. Come over here. What should we do? {FF84}Oh, Brother!? It's me, Tomoko! Something's wrong!{FF85} {FF84}You see, Dad... He's in a riot with a bunch of other people at Akane Mall! I got worried when I didn't see him for a while. But I wasn't expecting something like this to happen! I tried calling out to him, but he didn't respond, and I'm too scared to go near him with the other rioters around... Please, Brother! Help him... Help Dad! Bring him home!{FF85} {FF81}, what's wrong? Your father's caught up in a riot at Akane Mall!? What's going on!? If Tomoko said it was him, then he has to be there, but I can't imagine your dad ever joining in a riot... Anyway, let's go to Akane Mall! We need to bring him home! Um, Leader, we're going to Akane Mall! ...Gotcha. {FF80}, Hitomi, be careful. {FF81}, we need to hurry, right!? You have no new messages. There is no new information on Summoner Net. Good evening. This is Paradigm X News. Days ago, a party was held to celebrate the content completion of Paradigm X's development. Vice-Minister Nishi, head of the Amami City ""model city"" project, was there and spoke about what more is to come. Every home in Amami City now has a free computer, connected to the citywide network installed by Algon Soft. Being able to celebrate Paradigm X's completion with all of you is a momentous honor and a pleasure. It has been five years since our project began... and now, Amami City has grown to become the envy of the entire world. What that means to you is that the people of this city are the most technologically advanced in the world. Think of the Citizen IDs registered to you as proof of this. We, and Algon Soft, promise you all a life of light and convenience. After Mr. Nishi's speech, Mr. Kadokura, director of Algon Soft, the developers of Paradigm X, spoke. The following was taken from his comments on the completion of Paradigm X. I can't be giving out details before the official launch, ha ha, but... It is perfect. Some of our beta testers may be viewing this broadcast in Paradigm X itself. Afterwards, the two shook hands and promised to expend all efforts to further develop this city. The people of Amami City definitely have a future to look forward to. Days ago, a party was held to celebrate the content completion of Paradigm X's development. The party was full of famous faces, including Vice-Minister Nishi, head of the Amami model city project... ...as well as Kadokura, president of Algon Soft, which was contracted to develop Paradigm X for Amami City. Both men promised to continue giving their full efforts on the project and shook hands. Next is this week's ""Dungeon Q Grand Quiz King"" corner. The person who answered these difficult questions to become the Grand Quiz King is... {FF81} {FF82} of Akanedai! Congratulations, {FF81}! Romero of Nikamimon!

That's interesting. There's nothing like this back in my country. Come to think of it, I believe that I first learned the rules of society in a bathhouse.

I mean, I could eat anything I wanted without having to worry about calories. I wish I could go back in time. I come here when I'm sick of my family. My son just doesn't respect me anymore. I... I don't... want to go back to my new job. I thought it was good in the beginning, what with the place being full of girls. I thought it was heaven. But... But then! They've been working me to the bone! They're all ""Pour me some tea,"" and ""My stockings are running, go buy me new ones!"" And someone stole my lunch! I don't wanna have to go back to that place anymore... I've been thinking a lot about my childhood lately. I never had to make my own dinner, I didn't clean the house or wash dishes... It was the good life. I come here when I'm sick of my family. My son just doesn't respect me anymore. My neighbors have been talking bad about me. They say I'm just a good-for-nothing kid who won't get a job, and they laugh at me when I pass by. So, I'm not going to leave my house anymore. So I really am just a bird in a cage after all... I can say whatever I want in here. But in real life, I can never get myself to spit it out. I come here when I'm sick of interacting with real people. My boss has been on my back... I feel like you're my only friend. You won't betray me, will you, Internet Friend? We should go to the VR Haunted Mansion sometime... I feel old. A woman's got to be young, or else she's not any good, right? ...Nah. I come here when I'm sick of interacting with real people. My boss has been on my back... UNDER_CONSTRUCTION Hey! Hey! I'm outta booze! Bring... Bring me s'more! Oh, wait... yer not really here. I mean, I live by m'self, so there's nobody who c'n do that f'r me. I don't hav' anyb'dy t' go drinkin' with... Isn't that jes' sad? We all notice our hardships in life, but there are good things in our lives, right? UNDER_CONSTRUCTION Come to think of it, last year I worked alllllllllllllllllll summer. And this year? Guess what! I worked alllllllllllllllllllllllllllll summer. Well, because of that, my skin is so clear, and I don't have to worry about being out in the sun! ...Yeah. sigh The sun is setting once again... My company is ""undergoing managerial restructuring..."" When I was small, I was good at knitting. We should knit together one of these days. I'm good at undoing tangled yarn. Coming home to an empty house is lonely. I want to get a cat, but I don't know if I'll be able to feed it every day... Maybe I'll get a Mecchi. What was my life about...? I don't even know anymore. I just feel like I want to stay here forever. Is my social studies test tomorrow...? No, wait... I'm meeting with the president of my company tomorrow! ...Or do I have a language exam? My mom's been nagging me about going to one of those matchmaker programs. Up until now, I've always said that I'll never go to one of those things... But lately, I think I'm coming around. Hahaha... I want to be here... like this... watching the sunset forever... Where... am I? I have to... go to school... Wait... Things are getting strange in here lately. It's creeping me out, so I think I'll stop playing. Plus... I've been kind of busy. I went to one of those matchmakers, and I got set up with a nice guy. With all these dates I'm going to be going on, I won't have time to play Paradigm X. Hee hee... Hahaha... I don't... need anything. Hmahahaha... Mommy... Mommy...... UNDER_CONSTRUCTION Ahah... Ha... heh hm heheheh... This forum's supposed to feel like you're at a beach resort. Nothing beats the real thing, but this place isn't half-bad. Hmmmmmmmmmmmm. So this is the Beach Forum. If it was an ugly place, I wouldn't come back, but I think I can live with this. This might be virtual reality, but even then I kind of stand out in this getup, huh? This place is pretty nice. I can even feel the gentle sea breeze on my face. I go to resorts like this all the time, so if there's anything you want to know, just ask me. I hear you can go into the paintings at the VR Art Museum. That's definitely something you can only do in cyberspace! Have you heard? Paradigm X is going to start something called ""VR Tours."" I'm sure it'll be pretty good, but it can't beat the real thing. Two years ago I was in California, and last year Cote d'Azur... I was planning to visit Phuket this year, but until then, this'll have to do. I hear you can go into the paintings at the VR Art Museum. That's definitely something you can only do in cyberspace! UNDER_CONSTRUCTION Two years ago I was in California, and last year Cote d'Azur... I was planning to visit Phuket this year, but until then, this'll have to do. I'm nocturnal by nature, so I don't actually hang out in the sun much. I'm usually dancing the night away at EL-115. To be honest, I've gotten into diving recently. Maybe one of these days, I'll ride a dolphin... I'm just kidding. Ah, this brings back memories of the wind off Santa Monica pier... Greeting, Netizen! Are you taking a short vacation, too? Captain Paradigm is here to relax! ...Is what I want to say, but there is no rest for the hero of the cyberworld! You just enjoy your stay! Ignore me! I heard that they're delaying those ""VR Tours."" The rumors are that it has something to do with the sponsor, Leon Automotive. When you reach my status, it's irritating to get lumped in with your average woman. My biggest complaint about Paradigm X is that nobody gets to see what I really look like! ...What's with that lady? She's pretty damn rude. People like her tend not to have as many friends as they think. Have you tried out the VR Haunted Mansion yet? I'm not very good with scary stuff... When you reach my status, it's irritating to get lumped in with your average woman. My biggest complaint about Paradigm X is that nobody gets to see what I really look like! You know that club, EL-115? The DJs there are known as ""Reticulian."" They're twins. Apparently the two of them were child prodigies. But once they turned 20, they turned out to be not all that different from you or me. UNDER_CONSTRUCTION When you're at my level, you don't go sightseeing or shopping when you're in a foreign country. The true way to enjoy a resort is to simply relax. But everyone gets excited when they're on vacation. They just don't get it. That lady keeps going on about ""Phuket this, Phuket that."" She should shut up and go already. Or is she the type who talks a big game and never actually comes through? UNDER_CONSTRUCTION Amami City's been getting dangerous lately... I want to sit back and relax in Phuket soon. I wish that lady would just shut up. Who would even want her ID? Cyberterrorists? I hope they don't ruin this fantastic place. Have you heard? There are cyberterrorists around! How creepy! Thinking about having my ID stolen by these thugs just gives me goosebumps. ""Phuket, Santa Monica, blah bleh blah..."" I bet she just picked all those names out of a guidebook. Just because people can't see who you really are doesn't mean you get to be such a snooty bitch. Woah, hey, let's keep it civil in here. It would seem that vulgar girl over there is badmouthing me. She's just jealous, poor thing. But she's getting on my nerves! If she keeps it up, I'm going to sue her for libel! UNDER_CONSTRUCTION UNDER_CONSTRUCTION I'm... I'm not like these people! I'm different! Don't you group me in with them! I'm the noblest, greatest, beautifulest woman in the world! Everyone should be worshiping me! Why am I being treated as one of the commonfolk!? Listen to me! I'm number one! UNDER_CONSTRUCTION UNDER_CONSTRUCTION I'm... I'm not like these people! I'm different! Don't you group me in with them! I'm the noblest, greatest, beautifulest woman in the world! Everyone should be worshiping me! Why am I being treated as one of the commonfolk!? Listen to me! I'm number one! When I'm in here, men start talking to me just because I'm using a female avatar. Is it like that in the outside world, too? That's disturbing, isn't it? Greetings, Netizen! Have you gotten used to navigating Paradigm X? If you can't move smoothly, try using the B Button and the L and R Buttons. But remember, you can't go through a door sideways or backwards! Farewell! Man, I didn't think I'd win a beta license. I'm so lucky! Even in this new city, urban legends are being formed left and right. The Red Cape that haunts restrooms, the Turbo Hag that terrorizes the highway, the Purple Mirror that eats your soul... I love stories like that. I wonder if anybody has any new ones... Love blossoming from two souls meeting on the Net... That's just so romantic. Hmhmhm... The president of Algon Soft, Kadokura, is a genius, or so I hear. Making Algon Soft one of the world's top software companies, a blink of an eye after founding it... That's a success story anyone would be jealous of. I've started using the online mall in Paradigm X to shop online. I used to go to Akane Mall all the time when I wanted to shop, but it's just so much easier here! Love blossoming from two souls meeting on the Net... That's just so romantic. Hmhmhm... The president of Algon Soft, Kadokura, is a genius, or so I hear. He founded Algon Soft, and only a few short years later he's pushed it into the world's top software company. That's a success story anyone would be jealous of. The explosion at Amami Airport has been ruled an accident, but there are rumors that it was terrorism. In this day and age, you can look up instructions on how to make any kind of bomb... The world's a scary place now. Huh? You want to meet me? Oh, what to say... I'll think about it. Have you heard? Apparently there's a ghost on the Amami Bypass along the bay. It's the reason why there's all that new construction going on. It's this city's own urban legend! The big tree at the VR Park has some program that makes it grow depending on who visits it. I mean, it was explained to me in all these technical terms, but that's really all I remember from it. Huh? You want to meet me? Oh, what to say... I'll think about it. Being able to connect to Paradigm X for free is incredible. I don't have to worry about being hit with some huge bill at the end of the month anymore. I... Me and my boyfriend split up. Was it because we went on a date at Nikamimon? We thought it was just a rumor, so we laughed at it... Hello there. To tell you the truth, I'm just a newbie at this. This is my first time on Paradigm X. You look like you've been playing a while. Can I come to you if I have any questions about this place? Do you know how UFOs fly? I hear they use the 115th element, which doesn't exist on Earth. I've been getting tired a lot recently. Maybe it's just me... Hi there. You know, I just started using Paradigm X. And I was thinking: all the people here sound very similar, right? Very polite, if you know what I mean. Well, maybe I'm doing it, too... I've been talking to one of the girls who comes here, and I've developed an interest in the occult. I don't really believe in that stuff, but... What if... you know... what if! What if ghosts, demons, and UFOs all exist, and we don't know it? That can't be good! ...Is it weird of me to be thinking about stuff like this? Hey... What if I said I was really a man? In this world, there's no way of proving it. Hmhmhm... UNDER_CONSTRUCTION Demons exist! They do! ...At least, I've been feeling like they do. I wonder if there's a demon database that could calm my nerves. I heard there was an explosion at Shibahama. They say it was an accident, but with the Amami Airport, too, I think something might be going on... UNDER_CONSTRUCTION Rumor has it there's some strange disease spreading around town. I'm sure it's just a hoax that some kids spread around just for laughs. So, what do these ""cyberterrorists"" do, exactly? I don't really understand. What, are they going to blow up the Internet? Hack the Megahertz? Steal our IPs? Have you heard this new rumor that there are actually a lot of missing people in this city? Hearing that makes me really excited. That riot at Akane Mall... It was such a big thing, so why wasn't there any more coverage about it? Hmhmhm... Nobody knows the real me... UNDER_CONSTRUCTION Poetry is with the opposition. I'll sing for the resistance. Oh, crap! Will my ID be deleted for saying something like that? UNDER_CONSTRUCTION UNDER_CONSTRUCTION UNDER_CONSTRUCTION UNDER_CONSTRUCTION UNDER_CONSTRUCTION UNDER_CONSTRUCTION Welcome to Paradigm X Bank. Both Amami City and Paradigm X use a new form of electronic payment.

That cyber gate is only the beginning of the catastrophe that will befall this city. The day of reckoning is near. I must speak with you in order to prevent that calamity from occurring. But words alone cannot convey the means to prevent it. You yourself must embrace the will to do so through a Vision Quest. Vision Quests are how souls communicate. Your own soul will touch with souls that have completed their lives on this world. At this point, you will be meeting the soul of a man named Urabe. You will become Urabe, and relive part of his own life. However, the Vision Quest is a perilous journey. Death within the vision means death for you, {FF81} {FF82}. Once you reach the point where Urabe's life truly ended, your soul will be freed. And, with his will, you shall return to reality. Now, {FF82}, go. Take up the will of this fallen warrior and make your own. ... Ah, it's you... ...Algon NS, right? I'm on my way there right now. Doesn't matter... The Phantom Society is my enemy, too. Think of it this way... I'm doing your job while I'm at it. Still, it's an odd assignment. You just want me to copy the data from a particular terminal in the building into this COMP? One program, that's it? ...""Her""? Whatever. I don't care about whatever you've got on that machine. Which terminal is it? ...The computer room... And you're sure that's the only one the data you need is on, right? All right.  I'm on my way. I have been waiting for you, {FF82}. This being your second time, I assume you are aware of what a Vision Quest entails. There are no words to describe the soul. You can only use your own soul to absorb the full experience. The next soul you will contact is that of a man named Judah Singh. He was a Dark Summoner. In a way, he was in the exact opposite position as yourself. But, the root of the calamity can be seen in his final moments. Now, {FF82}, open the eyes within your heart. Communication between souls is a question of the spirit. You must find the answer with all your body and soul. It's been a while, Judah. I need your services once again... I thought I was done cleaning up your messes before you started building this model city. Now there's a new demon at the construction site for your new airport? You're a magnet for demons, Mr. Nishi. Enough joking. This isn't a laughing matter. This must be an effect of the Manitou Net. It's intruded into the airport's main system. This is proof that our project is going well, but we cannot ignore the problem. And you want me to defeat that demon... When you say ""main system,"" do you mean the control room? That's where it should be. Do you accept the job? Excuse me. Finnegan... What of Urabe? We've found the body of one of the investigating members. Seems Urabe got to him first. He stands firm in his decision, eh... Hm. In the end, he just can't throw away his human emotions. I've dealt with the trouble that was going on because of the net. I'll go after him next. Go on... sigh We have some troublesome opposition. Sorry to hear that. The least I can do is kill the demon in the airport's control room. To the melody of my sax... So you have come, {FF82}. I have been waiting for you. As you know, many souls are about to be swallowed by the electric sea. It has... begun to walk the path of evil. You are the only ones who can stop it. Please lend me your power. Now hold on! Shouldn't you tell us who you really are, first? You keep changing forms and ordering us around, but just who are you, Kinap!? ...... Words change shape, blurring their meanings. That is why I have been inviting you to take the Vision Quests. As to who I am... Your enemy or not... This will all become clear to you as you communicate with souls. And Nemissa... Your destiny, as well... What!? So... you do know about me!? {FF82}, prepare yourself and go. This soul is the final Vision Quest. The final message of the slain warriors. Waiter, another order of the mango pudding, and the tapioca. Oh, and another of these tarts. Will you please stop this, Naomi? This conversation is going nowhere. Oh, but I warned you about the underground ruins below Amami before, Mister. I'd say this is your own fault. I didn't expect the demons sleeping there to be that powerful. My Summoners don't stand a chance. I see... Why don't you try changing locations, then? That system you're building, this ""Manitou""... Is there a reason you have to place it underneath the city? It's one of Kadokura's demands. I have left Manitou completely up to him. It has to be there, or there will be trouble for our plans. I don't know what your scheme is here, but ancient demons tend to be rather troublesome, you know. Yes, that's why I've come to you. I want you to deal with this. Well, now. That all depends on the offer... As you know, the path in the ruins splits into two, with both ways leading to a demon-- Tiamat and Apsu. Both of them fairly important beings in ancient Sumerian folklore. We need room to set up our main system. You only need to defeat one of them. I'll leave it up to you as to which one you'd rather fight. You will be paid handsomely, of course. ......Very well, Mister. I accept the job. ""Welcome to Paradigm X!"" Let's go, {FF81}. It's supposed to be here... But I don't see anyone. Where is everybody? Are we too early? Oh, you guys beat me here. Sorry for calling you here so suddenly. Masahiro Sakurai Alias: Leader Handle: Spooky The founder and chief of the hacking group, the Spookies. He is a capable man who is respected by the others. So, what happened? You moved the HQ without any warning. It's nothing, really. I've just got something on my mind. Come on, let's talk inside. ""Kinap"", huh... I haven't heard of any hackers going by that name, either. This guy even knew {FF81}'s name. That's what bothers me... Maybe you're just being paranoid. You got your name on the beta list without any problems, after all. Amami City's a fully network-integrated city. It wouldn't surprise me if there was a hacker that skilled out there. Still, I wouldn't think that you'd be all that worried about something like that... You're right... I guess I wasn't acting like myself, huh. But, you said you had something on your mind? What is it? You're right... Maybe I'm too worried about what happened. But, you said you had something on your mind? What is it? H-Hey! What are you saying!? Ha ha! Well, either way, I don't think there's any cause for concern. I suppose not... But, you said you had something on your mind before? What is it? Hmm... Well, I guess I'll show you two first. You see, I picked up something interesting recently. What is this...? Is that... a gun? Looks like one, doesn't it? But when you unlatch this part... Wait, so this is a PC? I'm calling it a ""gun-type PC"" for now, but that's really all I know about it. But what does this have to do with moving our HQ? Ever since I obtained this, I've noticed some suspicious people following me around. This PC is the only reason I can think of that would explain that. It's more just to soothe my nerves, though. But is this thing really all that special...? I don't know. I plan on doing some research. I'm glad you two showed up so early. I'm going back to the junk store I bought this thing from. Watch over the trailer while I'm gone, okay? If we can learn what this gun-type PC really is, we might be able to figure out who those suspicious guys are, too. I'll leave the gun PC with you. I don't want to risk getting back on those guys' radar. I'll see you later. Huh? Hold on, Leader... Geez, he called us just so we could babysit the trailer for him? Still, I doubt anyone else will show up soon... Exit Well, we can't do anything right now. We might as well wait for the others to get here. ......... It's not working. Is it broken? Well, we don't have anything else to do. Oh, I know! Let's check out Paradigm X. You just got the license, so let's see what the big deal is. That'll pass the time until Lunch and the others get here. Come on, let's do it! Ha ha, I'm kind of excited! Hey! We're gonna play Paradigm X, right!? Welcome to Paradigm X! This is the User Counter, your portal to accessing this virtual world. First-time users will receive an explanation of Amami City's network. Please listen carefully. Ah hah haaaaaaah! If you need to know anything about the 'Net, just come to me! I am this world's defender of justice! CAPTAIN PARADIGM! Let me tell you about the network that connects the beloved citizens of Amami City to Paradigm X. Paradigm X is a virtual city located on the massive servers of the Algon Soft corporation. The network that connects that server to your PCs is a city-wide broadband intranet that runs throughout Amami City. Thanks to this network, you can enter Paradigm X freely from your home PC and meet with your friends online. With no lag and a nigh-zero percent rate of packet loss, the intranet of Amami City makes Paradigm X truly another world! Now, allow me to briefly describe my home of Paradigm X, the dream city that resides within this network. Anything you want can be found on Paradigm X's virtual streets: a movie theater, pet shops... anything! Through your PCs, you can access these ""cyber-shops"" and use them at any time. The city of the future never closes! This is truly the life of the future, brought to Amami City by Algon Soft! But, enough from me. It's time for you to experience it for yourself! Now, have a goooooooood time! Hahaha! Did you enjoy the explanation? It's now time for you to actually experience Paradigm X. You may be surprised by the intense quality of the virtual city. When you want to end your time in Paradigm X, please return here. And... Have fun! What are you doing? Let's go, already. What are you doing!? We need to go help Leader! Let's go save Leader. Hey, Six! SIX! Ugh, shut up. What is it? C'mon, man, you promised me last time we met up. So give it! Give what? I don't remember promising you anything. What!? You promised! You said you'd give me a cool hacker handle, like everyone else has! You must've come up with something, right? C'mon, give me a name. You don't get a name! You're still a noob! Huh!? But... But you promised! C'mon, man! Name me! Ugh, shut up. Fine. From now on, your name is ""AAAA"". No! I don't want a half-assed name like that! C'mon, man, at least TRY to think of something clever for me! What, now you're complaining? All right, then, here's a name that fits you perfectly. You're obnoxious and you're constantly wearing that stupid hat... We're gonna call you ""Habr-r"", pronounced ""Haberdasher""! What!? No, that's awful! Don't name me that! Both of you, shut the hell up. Oh, {FF80}. How was the Goumaden? Did you learn anything? You have no new messages. There is no new information on Summoner Net. Sorry, {FF80}, but I'm using the PC to investigate the Phantom Society. All right, let's go to the Goumaden. ...Okay, Leader, I'm heading out. Oh, {FF80}, you're back. Nice timing, {FF80}. We've just found something new on this Summoner Net of theirs. To all Summoners: The Sea Ark has finally been completed and is now open. The Sea Ark will become an excellent training ground for Summoners. You can access the Ark using your license card. We hope that you will continue to hone your skills and become powerful soldiers for the Phantom Society. Phantom Society THE DAY IS COMING. I just tasked Six and Yu-Ichi with digging up info around town. We'll give you a call if we find anything, Leader. Hey, Yu-Ichi, quit wasting time! Heeeey, hold up! I'm coming! ...Oh, see ya, {FF80}. So, how'd it go on your end? Yes, about the Goumaden... Victor, huh... He didn't seem to be associated with the Phantom Society, but... He was a creep. From what it sounds like, he doesn't deal with people who don't have COMPs. We have no way to communicate with him ourselves, then... Sorry, but we'll have to let you deal with him. Oh, {FF80}. Did you find out anything? You have no new messages. To all Summoners: The Sea Ark has finally been completed and is now open. The Sea Ark will become an excellent training ground for Summoners. You can access the Ark using your license card. We hope that you will continue to hone your skills and become powerful soldiers for the Phantom Society. Phantom Society THE DAY IS COMING. Sorry, {FF80}, but I'm using the PC to investigate the Phantom Society. {FF81}, let's go to the Warehouse District. We need to find that doll for Victor. Yo, {FF80}. I found this on the Summoner Net, so I called you. Take a look. Man, this blows. I've been hearing people talking crap about me! Me, Carol J! Can you believe it!? I just underestimated that guy at NS! If I'd been serious, I wouldn't have lost to that kid or his airhead girl. For all you non-believers, come on down to the Astrology Museum and I'll give you a special live performance. How could I forget him? That's the Summoner who locked me up at Algon NS. I don't know what he's planning to do, but this is the perfect chance to find out more about this Phantom Society. But, he IS a Summoner. So what we'll do is... Huh? Are you listening? He just called me an airhead! Who does he think he is!? He's the one that ran away! That does it! I'll make sure he never talks again! ...I don't know what this Summoner is planning to do, but we can't just ignore this chance. I know it's dangerous, {FF80}, but I want you to check it out. Good. I'll let you handle this however you want. But, remember to be careful. Why are you getting cold feet now!? I'm not gonna let him diss us on the Net like that! Wh-Whoa, there. I'm glad you're going, but remember to be careful. Oh, and I installed an observer program to check Summoner Net for new info whenever it comes up. It'll let you know when they post something new. Make sure to check when it alerts you. {FF84}...Hello, Leader? It's me, Six.{FF85} {FF84}About that Sea Ark in the Summoner Net posting... It looks like that's the hotel under construction in Amami Bay. It looks like it's been completed, but they say it's still under construction. They aren't taking reservations yet. Maybe you can get in with one of those license cards they were talking about. We're going to look around a little more before we head back. Later, we'll--Yu-Ichi, don't touch th--{FF85} Looks like they've found out what the Sea Ark really is. A license, huh... Maybe that one I gave you earlier is the one you'll need to get in. I want you to check that out, too, but the Astro Museum comes first. I think we've figured out what the Sea Ark is---oh, yeah. You don't know about that yet, do you? We found some more information on the Net, so I had Six and Yu-Ichi investigate. I had them ask around, and we found what we think is the place. A license, huh... Maybe that one I gave you earlier is the one you'll need to get in. I want you to check that out, too, but the Astrology Museum comes first. You have no new messages. Man, this blows. I've been hearing people talking crap about me! Me, Carol J! Can you believe it!? I just underestimated that guy at NS! If I'd been serious, I wouldn't have lost to that kid or his airhead girl. For all you non-believers, come on down to the Astrology Museum and I'll give you a special live performance. Sorry, {FF80}, but I'm using the PC to investigate the Phantom Society. Let's go, {FF81}. I won't back down until we crush that guy at the Astro Museum! Oh, welcome back, you guys. Oh, Yu-Ichi. You're back? Yeah. I'm studying how to hack right now. Hmmm, good for you. I want to become a full-fledged hacker and get myself a cool handle name. Then I can work with all of you as a member of Spookies. Man, I can't wait. Oh, {FF80}. Find out anything at the Astro Museum? You have no new messages. WTF, man. I've been hearing rumors that say Carol J is weak. I just underestimated the guy at NS! If I was serious, I wouldn't lose to that kid or that airhead bitch. For all you non-believers, come to the Astro Museum. I'll show you a very special live performance. Sorry, {FF80}, but I'm using the PC to investigate the Phantom Society. C'mon, {FF81}. We're going to the Astro Museum! Oh, {FF80}.  Hey, your sister... Tomoko. Is she... Is she okay? What's this, Yu-Ichi? Trying to hit on {FF80}'s sister? Ha ha ha! No, I'm not, Six. Don't say things like that. I'm an only child, so I'm just jealous of people who have siblings. Don't you feel that way, too, Six? What're you talking about? I'm... I... Huh? ...Yeah, I'm not jealous. Now come on. If we're heading out, let's hurry up. Damn, why do I always have to do the babysitting...? See you later, {FF80}. You too, Hitomi. You have 1 new message. From ""Tomoko"": Hey, brother! How are you? I'm doing well. Um, I'm borrowing your PC to play Paradigm X. I'm really interested in the VR Art Museum. If I find anything really neat, I'll let you know. Bye! There is no new information on Summoner Net. Oh, sorry for calling you out here without warning. I contacted you because I found a good deal. Have you heard of the club ""EL-115""? It's just north of here, and it's pretty popular. There's a pair known as Reticulian there. To the public, they're known as the club's DJs, but they're actually both incredibly skilled hackers. Their code is pure brilliance. They can even hold their own against Algon's resident genius, Kadokura. I've asked them to improve the software you're using. Everything's been taken care of. Just go talk to them. I'll take you there. It's pretty much around the corner. Hey, {FF80}, cut that out and let's get going. You have no new messages. There is no new information on Summoner Net. All right, off to EL-115. Hey, {FF80}, cut that out and let's get going. Oh, hey, you two. I've been poking around for any useful information, but their security is tight. I'm going to have you investigate something that might be incredibly dangerous. Be careful, and don't do anything to put yourselves in danger. You don't need to worry about us. What about you? It might be dangerous for you to get involved. Ha ha ha. Thanks for worrying about me, but I'll be all right. In any case... I think we've already passed the point of no return. So no matter what happens... Uh... Leader? You were saying? Oh, nothing. Now be careful. You have no new messages. There is no new information on Summoner Net. Hey, {FF80}. Let's just go to EL-115, okay? Let's hurry over to EL-115. Hey, {FF80}. You're back. Ah... You saw Lunch and his father, huh? I'd heard they weren't exactly on friendly terms, but... That's good to hear. Well, you can trust those guys. Their work is guaranteed. Oh, that's right. We got new information from Summoner Net. From the Systems division: The Demon Trading System is complete. The system can be accessed within the pet shop in Paradigm X. To use it, input the password there. The password is: ""THXDVL"". ""Thanks Devil,"" huh? Nice password. It looks like you're the man for this one. Now... I'm going to keep investigating outside. I'll talk to you later. You have 1 new message. From ""Resident Administrative Bureau"": Good day, citizens of Amami City. Have you become acquainted with the ID system? Your Citizen ID is an important part of your life in this city. Please report any abuse or illegal uses to the Resident Administrative Bureau. From the Systems division: The Demon Trading System is complete. The system can be accessed within the pet shop in Paradigm X. To use it, input the password there. The password is: ""THXDVL"". {FF81}... Let's go check up on Tomoko. ...It looked like Tomoko lost consciousness while she was playing Paradigm X. You did, too. It was when you were on that Vision Quest in Paradigm X after meeting Kinap. There must be something about Paradigm X. If we use Nemissa's power to dive inside, we might be able to save Tomoko. H-Hold on. Why does Nemissa have to do that? You want to know about Kinap, too, don't you? If we go now, we might be able to meet him. I don't know what Kinap is trying to do, but I can't forgive him for getting Tomoko involved in this. The PC was left at the VR Art Museum, so there should be something going on there. Hmmm... I feel like I'm being tricked here, but fine, I'll help you this time. Huh? Hold on, {FF81}, there's new info on Summoner Net. From the Systems division: The Demon Trading System is complete. The system can be accessed within the pet shop in Paradigm X. To use it, input the password there. The password is: ""THXDVL"". A Demon Trade System? I wonder how that works. But, let's remember that password: ""THXDVL"". Hey, stop wasting time. We're going to the VR Art Museum, right? Hold on, {FF81}. We need to go save Tomoko. You have no new messages. From the Systems division: The Demon Trading System is complete. The system can be accessed within the pet shop in Paradigm X. To use it, input the password there. The password is: ""THXDVL"". Do you need time to prepare? That's good thinking, but... Let's be sure to hurry so we can save Tomoko, okay? You have no new messages. There is no new information on Summoner Net. Do you need time to prepare? That's good thinking, but... Let's be sure to hurry so we can save Tomoko, okay? {FF81}, let's go see how Tomoko-chan is doing. Oh, hey, guys. I just finished eating Lunch's fried rice. It was good. We're about to head out to the parts shop together. Lunch, are you done cleaning up? I'm almost done, so just hang in there. Hey... Now that I think about it, why are you so good at cooking? I mean, you can make anything. ...When my mom got sick, I had no choice but to cook for us. I started to enjoy it. But she was always apologizing to me for making me do it, though... ...... Yeah, well, I love your cooking. It has that ""just like Mom used to make"" taste. I doubt anything your mother could make would taste as good as what you can do! You've had his fried rice before, don't you think I'm right, {FF80}? Ha ha, maybe. Now let's get going. Seeya, guys. Bye now. You have 1 new message. Message from ""Reticulian"": We've come up with some new software, so we're contacting you. It's called Steiner, and it expands the fusion functions of the COMP. With this bad boy, you can fuse Spirits, Mitama, and Zoma. So come to EL-115 if you want it. There is no new information on Summoner Net. Hey, {FF81}, let's go see how Tomoko is doing. You have no new messages. There is no new information on Summoner Net. We've got to hurry to Leon Auto Plant. We need to catch that Moowis. Let's go to the Goumaden. Dammit... That idiot is gonna get himself killed. Oh, {FF80}. This isn't turning out good. First, take a look at this. To the young Summoner with the gun COMP. I see you took care of my demons at the airport. I want to thank you. Let's settle this, one-on-one. I'm waiting for you at the Amami Float.                          Finnegan Do you know this Finnegan? How can I forget!? He's the Summoner who sicced his demons on us and left. So this WAS about you guys... To tell you the truth, there are signs that this posting has been accessed before we found it. Dammit... That idiot. Don't tell me... Yu-Ichi... He went to the Amami Float by himself? That's so reckless! Finnegan's a killer. At this rate... Yeah. We need to save him... Six, this is because you yelled at him at the plant. I just told him the truth! Enough! There's no time for this. Let's just go. We should be able to take the shuttle beneath the airport to get to the Amami Float. Hey man, we don't have time for that. You have 1 new message. Message from ""Reticulian"": Oh, hello there, {FF80}. Is everything rosy? We've developed some new software, and I just wanted to let you know. I recommend the ""Dark Man"". It's a revolutionary new program that allows you to speak with Dark Demons. I'll be waiting for you at the club. Ta-ta! To the young Summoner with the gun COMP.

We have hired a Summoner to take care of it. The bypass should reopen within a few days. We have hired a Summoner to take care of it, but it would appear that someone else has already defeated it. We are currently seeking out the identity of the one who did this. It might be the work of a non-Society Summoner. In any case, the bypass should reopen within a few days. What are you waiting for? I need you to bring Six here. You have 1 new message. Message from ""Resident Administrative Bureau"": Official notice from the Resident Administrative Bureau. The following ID has been deleted based on Amami City regulation #207, clause 4. {FF81} {FF82} ID-ZD495401E This account's access to Amami City's communication and information networks is now cut off. You cannot access Paradigm X. You cannot access Summoner Net. Let's go to Six's place. What? Why do we need to see Six? What happened? His soul's been taken by a demon. So... Is that the unknown disease that's been going around? What? What unknown disease? I don't know about... Oh, right. Okay, tell me what this is about. I heard rumors about people having the same symptoms as Six all over Amami City. Really? But if this is the work of demons... What's actually going on? Well, at the very least, we'll need to check on Six, too. {FF80} and Hitomi, head to EL-115. EL-115? Where those Reticulian guys are? It's for the ID problem. I completely forgot that we had such powerful allies. It's best to leave trouble like that to them. It should be done by now. Done? You mean, they made a fake ID for you? It's like Lunch said before: we're all just bits, right? You'll understand once you talk to them. We'll see you later. Let's go, Lunch. Names, numbers... Humans place so much value on superficial labels. It's so stupid. That's just the way things are. There are so many people, we need a way to keep them straight. Let's go to EL-115. Hey, {FF81}. Do you hear voices from outside? ...Yeah, there's definitely someone out there. Let's see who it is. I told you, I don't know what you're talking about! Yes, you do! You and I were the only people in that room. You stole it, didn't you? H-Hey, what's going on? Weren't you going to Six's place? Hm? Y-Yeah, but Lunch's father was waiting for us outside. Apparently a chip prototype from the factory he works at went missing. Hmm... Could that be the chip Lunch brought here a while back...? That's my guess... This is your problem! Don't be bugging me about this! Find it on your own! I'm outta here, Leader! H-Hey, Lunch, wait. Oh, well... Hnnnn... If he's reacting like that, Junnosuke must be the thief... Lunch is pretty cold towards you. He's not like that to anyone else. Ha... He has a grudge against me. I can't say I entirely blame him, though. By the way, Miss, would you know what Junnosuke did with the chip? When I first saw it, he was replacing some other chip... Kry... something. Krypto? I see. Well, in that case... I must be on my way. Goodbye. I feel sorry for him... Huh? Someone left mail open. Paradigm X VR Park Operator Code: ""PK0930PX"" What's this? ""VR Park""? Does this need decoding? Did Leader find something important while he was hacking? He could've told us... Oh, yeah. No ID... The code is ""PK0930PX"". I've memorized it. You have no new messages. You cannot access Summoner Net. Let's hurry to EL-115. No one's here. Hee hee! Nemissa has an idea! Maybe I'll let you two have some private time together. I'm cheering you on. ...Ah! What's with Nemissa? She's always causing trouble. ...I'm kind of nervous. Is there something we should talk about, {FF81}? You know I'm fine with being alone. I'm used to it, and I've got a loud partner all the time now, too. ...But I've been really forgetful lately. I'm not lonely, but maybe I'm a bit tired. Oh, I'm fine. I've been really forgetful lately, though. Maybe I am a bit tired. Oh, you! ...I guess I do get hungry, even when I'm sad. But eating doesn't seem to be helping me with how tired I've been... Plus, I've been really forgetful lately... I wonder why? I wonder if I'm so tired because of Nemissa... I wonder if she's the reason why it's so hard to remember things... Nemissa, it's okay. Being forced to talk together like this makes it too awkward. ...What, you're done already? I thought it'd be more interesting than that. Let's go to EL-115. You have no new messages. You cannot access Summoner Net. All right, I'm set. Now we can dive back into Paradigm X whenever we want. We should go to the VR Haunted Mansion. If we're dealing with demons, I'm worried about Six. You have no new messages. There is no new information on Summoner Net. We need to save Six! Let's hurry to the VR Haunted Mansion. You have no new messages. There is no new information on Summoner Net. All right {FF81}, let's go see how Six is doing now. Welcome to Paradigm X. Please enjoy your stay here. This is the Goumaden? It's pretty big... I can't believe this thing even floats. Is this really the same Goumaden as was in that message? You think we'll be okay in there? Heeheehee. Looks like fun. Let's take a peek. Wow... It's huge in here. I don't see any demons, though. Welcome to the Goumaden. Excuse me, but who might you be? O-Oh, we're...... I'm afraid that I cannot allow you to pass without a reservation. Please leave. Huh, oh, but we're-- Please leave. Ugh, you're like a lifeless doll! We're here because the COMP told us to come! This is the Goumaden, right? Ho-ho... You wield a COMP. Pardon our impoliteness. Master Victor... I apologize, Mary, but these seem to be my new guests. Allow them to enter whenever they wish from now on. As you wish. Now then, guests. Would you show me this COMP you mentioned? ...I see. It's seen a bit of damage, but I should be able to fix it easily. You seem to know a lot about the COMP. Are you guys Summoners, too? Ha, I see. You have only recently set foot in this world, I assume? The doors to the Goumaden are open to all who have COMPs. Allow me to show you my sanctuary, my demon workshop... Madam Ginko... Rei said she's their overseer. I wonder what kind of person she is. You shouldn't let your guard down. It may be a trap. Precaution is necessary, but if you see everyone as a foe, you will lose sight of the true enemy. Huh? Who are you? It's a pleasure to meet you. My name is Ginko. I heard about you from Rei. So, you're {FF81}. And this must be Hitomi... It would appear that both of you have stepped onto a harsh path. Wow... She's so beautiful... I expected someone scarier...... Quit gawping at her, geez. Are you just gonna stand there staring all day? Get a hold of yourself. Hey, lady, if you've heard about us, then you know we're here to find out about the Phantom Society. Oh, I know. But Phantom is a much bigger and more fearsome organization than you think. Pursuing them will result in even more perilous battles. Especially for you, {FF81}... {FF81}, do you have the courage to carry out your will? Carrying out one's will is the only way to learn the purpose of existence. Perhaps that is humanity's worth... It may be too late to stop you. Man is a sad being, unable to know his own life's path without looking back into the past. This battle is a quest for your own self. My question meant nothing. The Phantom Society is an organization that has controlled the world from the shadows since long, long ago. Its power stretches across the world, and now this society can even control an entire nation. And what do goons like that want to do with this city? I do not know the full extent of what Phantom's plans are for Amami. What I do know is that the principles behind their actions transcend the common ideals of morality and justice. So they're not doing it for good or for evil...? ""Good"" and ""Evil"" are only ideas, created by human weakness, to support what drives our hearts. But Phantom is motivated by control. Their fight is for a completely different cause than yours. Control... Rei did not want to see you killed. That is why she introduced you to me. Your reason for fighting Phantom is not for me to know. However, as one who shares your objective, I shall cooperate with you as much as I can. As proof, I give you this. ...A sword? It doesn't look like much. The Nameless Sword. Much like {FF81} himself. Just as {FF81} obtained the COMP and became a Summoner... This sword will grow, too... Take this to the kitchen within the Goumaden. It will be of great use to you. Perhaps Rei saw something of that young man in you, {FF81}. What young man? Three years ago, there was a young man who had no choice but to become a Summoner. He was killed by a Dark Summoner, but his soul possessed the body of another Summoner... Before he gained his Summoner powers, he had lived a normal life. Rei knew that young man, very well. How strange... That sounds a lot like {FF81}'s situation. The two of you are too young to die. Do not act rashly! Thank you very much, Madam Ginko... About that young man... whatever happened to him? ...He is still working hard, believing in himself. Rei and Ginko... It's odd seeing so many women involved in dangerous demon things. What are you saying? You're involved in it, too. If you weren't here, I'd be a normal girl! ...Still, meeting at the Goumaden, huh? The world seems pretty big, but it's small in a lot of ways, isn't it? So, you're {FF81}. And this must be Hitomi... Oh... Are you Madam Ginko? It's a pleasure to meet you. My name is Ginko. I heard about you from Rei. ...It's just as Rei said. You two are so young, and yet hold so much power. Huh? But we just met... When you have amassed as much experience as I, one can tell how much power someone has simply by looking at them. She's definitely in the same business we are... {FF81}... May I ask you just one thing? Just as you know, the power you wield is something very powerful, beyond the reason of ordinary man. But, too much power can sometimes attract fate, no matter what its wielder wills. This fate may destroy not only you, but those dear to you... Knowing this, can you hold on to such power? ...You are a strong person. Perhaps that is why fate has chosen you. ...Good. Your weakness is what gives you power. It is because you are weak that you seek strength. I am sure you will become an even more splendid Summoner than you are now. You wanted to know about the Phantom Society, correct? I shall tell you what I know of them.  Hello.

Even Old Man Finnegan's making fun of me! But this is just perfect. Once I've killed you guys, I'll be back on top of the charts! I'll summon up a rockin' demon, and then I'm gonna shred licks 'til your faces melt! WoooooooOOOOOAH YEAH! CAN YOU HEAR IT!? The beat of my soul! Now, stars! You're just a bunch of crap, but you still have power! Call upon your master! Come on now! O great angel, Kokabel, I summon you! Um... Hey! Yo! Kokabel! Get your ass here! URRRRRRRRRRRRGH...... HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA...... ...Kokabel? Is that you? I... I AM... MOOWIS. I NEED... A-A BODY... ""Moowis""? What the hell! I summoned Kokabel! Wha--! Hey! Whaddya doing!? What the heck? What kind of a loser gets possessed by the demon he summons? SOUL... I SENSE... A STRONG SOUL... I WANT... I WANT... Huh? You want some? Come on, then! I'll kick your ass! M-MY BODY... URRRRRGH... N-NEED... A STRONGER BODY... STRONGER... LIKE... THAT WOMAN... Huh? What do you mean? H-Hey! This body's mine! Are you listening!? Ahhhhhhhhhh! ...I'm done. My flame's burned out, man... You beat me, buddy. I've never met a Summoner as rockin' as you. Guess it's time I retired... By the way, I think that demon maybe possessed your girl. I've never seen a demon like that before... Sorry, man. Look, you can have this. I'm not gonna need it anymore. software. I guess I'll have to start playing for change on the street... {FF84}Oh, hello? {FF81}? It's me, Hitomi. Y-You won't believe where I am right now...{FF85} {FF84}Geez! Don't do that! Hello? {FF81}? It's me, Nemissa.{FF85} {FF84}This is that Paradigm X place, huh? Hahaha! It's interesting. Hitomi keeps bugging me, so I'll make this quick. Meet up with me at the HQ. See ya!{FF85} Oh, you're back. Then I should return, too. Stand back a little. Wheeee! That was fun. Hm? You have to hear this! Nemissa can enter Paradigm X now! Bwhahaha! Surprised, aren't you? I was pretty surprised myself. You see, Nemissa can enter Paradigm X now! I think it was one of that Moowis demon's powers. I was suddenly able to do that after he tried to possess me. I don't know. When we got to Paradigm X, he wasn't there anymore. Y-Yes... I'm surprised, too, but I'm fine... Don't worry. That Moowis guy disappeared once we got to Paradigm X. ...Well, it'd be easier to show you instead of trying to explain. Let's go to Paradigm X together, {FF81}. What? No. I'm happy just watching through the monitor, thanks. Oh, you were crying the entire time, huh. ...... But too bad! I say we're going, so we're going! You have no new messages. There is no new information on Summoner Net. Hey, where do you think you're going? Here we go, {FF81}. Hold on tight! Thank you for visiting the Amami Astro Museum. Please, enjoy your visit. The door to the Planetarium is open. Please go on in. Thank you for visiting the Amami Astro Museum. To coincide with our new exhibit on the Zodiac, we are holding a ""Star Quiz."" There are five questions that you have ten seconds to answer. If you can answer all five questions correctly, you will be allowed to enter the Planetarium absolutely free! Goodbye. Then, let's begin. Are you ready? Question 1! Question 2! Question 3! Question 4! Question 5! Congratulations! You have answered all five questions correctly. The door to the Planetarium is now open. Please enjoy your visit... Correct. Time's up. I'm sorry. Please study harder and try the quiz again if you like! That is incorrect. I'm sorry. Please study harder and try the quiz again if you like! The password you entered is incorrect. {FF82}. You must not run. You have yet to hear the voice of this soul. Return... ...Debug mode is on. You may go outside. I welcome you, {FF82}. If you wish, I can heal your wounded body and remember how you lived. at this time. Close your eyes. Ugh. It's not done yet. ......Bon voyage. I pray for your luck. Hello. Welcome to the Amami Net terminal. There is 1 unread message for {FF80}-san. Testing, testing, 1-2-3... Onii-chan, this is a test mail. Did you get this? That's it. Bye-bye. There are no unread messages for {FF80}-san. Thank for using this terminal.  If you wish, I can heal your wounded body.  (You cannot be healed yet) Then farewell... I pray for your luck. Well, this is the place... Now to just rip the data from that terminal... ...VALIDATING ...CHECKSUM VALIDATED ...NEMISSA PROGRAM Nemissa... This is it... What kind of program is this? The file size is massive... It won't fit in my COMP... Crap... If I delete the demons in my summoning program, that should give me enough space... Nemissa... This is it... What kind of program is this? The file size is massive... ......... SUMMON PROGRAM DELETED. TRANSFERRING DATA. .................. ...... Hmhm... Hehehehe... Huh!? What was that!? Is this program... alive? I didn't think you'd have the spine to come waltzing back in here... Now, what's a traitor like you doing here? ...!? Who's there!? You've eluded the Society's grasp up 'til now... And it all ends with such disappointment. Tch, Finnegan! Your name used to strike fear in your enemies and look at you now. What happened to you? I don't know why you betrayed us, but it's a bad joke. You're nothing now. Hmph, I see the Society's still using the power of Summoners for evil. Heh. You're in no position to talk. Has the tragedy that took your family finally scared you? Y-You miserable cretin! Don't you dare talk about my family! Oh? Are those fighting words? You want to challenge me? You, of all people, should know my abilities... I... I can't die here! I must get this data to Kinap... Tch! Is this it for me!? ...But I won't die in vain. Luckily, they haven't realized I took the data... Are you done with your pointless struggling, Urabe...? Tch, dammit! ...Just one last question before you have to leave. What were you doing in that room? Hmph. I figured I'd get one last shot in against you scumbags. Heh. As if the actions of a worm could affect our organization in the slightest. Pathetic. When you meet your disappointed family in the afterlife, be sure to say hi for me. They'll know who I am. Keep hell warm for me, Urabe! ...So my life ends here... How pathetic. I lost myself in my family's deaths... I thought that my life was meaningless... Yet now... I only want... to live...... And now I ask you: who are you? Do you call yourself Urabe, resenting the mistake you made which led to your family's death, yet still yearning to live? Or are you {FF81} {FF82}, a soul ready to awaken again with newfound resolution born in your heart? Life is just a string that drags lasting will along. That is how will transcends lives and endures through time. Now, {FF82}, awaken. Call on the soul that is sealed before you. I am Kinap, he who talks with souls, he who guides souls. The souls of fallen warriors will lead you to your next Vision Quest. Until then, farewell. {FF81}...... {FF81}......? {FF81}, {FF81}, can you hear me!? Oh, you're finally awake! Thank goodness... Are you okay? You stopped moving all of a sudden, like you died or something. What happened? I kept calling you, but you didn't respond. I was really worried. Really...? I hope that's true. We're at Spookies HQ. Are you really okay? Hey, where are you going? Phew... giggle I'm finally out! The outside world at last! So you let me out... ummm... {FF81}, was it? Thanks! I really owe you one. It was soooo stuffy in there, being crammed in that tiny place for so long. It's a bit cramped here too, but it's way better now. Oh, my name's Nemissa, by the way. Nemissa, the demon. That's right. Why do you look so surprised? You're the one who summoned me. Hitomi? Oh, you mean this body? From now on, it's Nemissa. I can't move around without a body. I'm glad there was a body just within reach. But still, who locked Nemissa away in there? Whoever it is has some nerve. I gotta go find that jerk. When I find him I'm gonna beat his face in. Huh? What? Is there still something you-- Huh? No way! Not when I'm finally free! Don't you get in-- {FF81}, help me. I can't move. Nemissa, was it? Please, get out of my-- H-Hey! What's with you two!? U-Um, maybe if we use the gun-type PC again, we can seal her again. Huh? Y-You're kidding, right!? Hey, stop it! ......... COMP FUSION IS UNLOCKED. YOU CAN NOW FUSE DEMONS ON YOUR COMP. Huh? What was that message? That's not what it did last time! Is it broken? Wh-What's with you!? Don't be so mean! You're going to lock Nemissa up again!? Even if you saved my life, I won't let you do that to Nemissa! Whoa, whoa, whatcha fighting over? Shingo Sako Handle Name: Six A member of Spookies. Six is curious, easygoing, and always true to himself, while also being a bit rash. He's a noted gun enthusiast. It's pretty rare to hear Hitomi raise her voice. Junnosuke Kitagawa Handle Name: Lunch A member of Spookies. Lunch is earnest, but short-tempered. He's a master of machines who excels at modding hardware. Sorry I'm la--whoa, you dyed your hair, Hitomi!? Shut up! Who asked you! S-Sorry! It looks good on you, I didn't know you were so upset about it. Where are Leader and Yu-Ichi? Probably just lagging behind as usual. I think I have a good way to kill some time. Hey, {FF80}, you using the PC right now? I'm gonna shut it down for a sec. I got my hands on the latest and greatest model CPU. I was thinking about putting it in this PC. Let's see... It was here... All right, it should fit in the same slot... Just gotta pop this sucker out... Okay... Got it... Now to just put this in... And that should boost the processing speed. Not that I care, but all the PCs in the city are using the designated parts, right? Is it cool to swap it out like that? Who cares about this old and busted Krypto chip? It's all about the new hotness. What kind of hacker obeys the rules, anyway? I'm just saying. It's not my fault if Leader gets ticked at you for taking an unnecessary risk. So, it's all good as long as he doesn't, then. We'd be a lame hacker group if we all just used standard equipment. Eh, suit yourself. I'll be cleaning my guns. Whatever, I'm gonna take off. I can't waste time sitting around like this. Hm? Who's that? {FF84}H-Hello!? Is that you, {FF80}? It's me, Spooky. I'm at the Algon NS building right now, but something's gone wrong. Th-This place is full of m-monsters...{FF85} ...!? {FF84}Whoa--{FF85} ...... {FF84}H-Hello!? Is that you, {FF80}? It's me, Spooky. I'm at the Algon NS building right now, but something's gone wrong. Th-This place is full of m-monsters... {FF85} ...!? {FF84}Whoa--{FF85} ...... Is Leader okay...? Did he say monsters!? Why are you just staring into space? Whatever, fine, I'll answer it... Again. Hello? Hm? That you, Six!? It's me, Spooky!{FF85} Spooky? Why the hell'd you call us here and not show up? Where the hell are you? I'm at the Algon NS building right now. S-Something's gone totally wrong. This place is full of monster--Whoa!-- ......... H-Hey, Leader? You still there? He got cut off... What's going on over there? Leader is your friend, right? He was talking about monsters... Algon NS is a branch office of Algon Soft, right? What's Leader doing there? I don't know, but... That call was no joke. Leader was dead serious. What'd he mean by monsters? Is that code for cops or security? That's the most confusing part, but... We can't ignore this. We gotta go help Leader. Help? At the Algon NS building? You sure about this? Kyahahahaha! This sounds fun all of a sudden. Let's go, let's go! (Hey, I thought you were leaving!?) (Oh, shut up! I wanna go, so I'm going!) (I haven't been outside in such a long time. I'm aching for a fight. Don't worry, your body is ready!) (You don't need to use my body! Find another one, please! I don't like fighting!) (You can't tell Nemissa what to do! This is my body now, forever! You should just get used to it!) H-Hey, no need to start hopping around over there. We can all tell you're ready to go. You can come along. Aren't you guys worried about barging in empty-handed, though? I'll lend you all some of my collection. I never thought I'd ever use these in actual combat... Haha, is my collection badass or what? Well, we're all ready to go, then. The Algon NS building is at the north side of Nikamimon. Let's roll. What're you doing!? Leader's in trouble! We gotta go save him! Urabe, I modded your GUMP to the specifications you asked for. The programs  and  have been installed. You can start  from the submenu.  can be booted at any time by touching the bottom screen. Have fun with the new functions. Welcome. this is the Paradigm X User Center. Thank you for visiting Paradigm X. We await your next visit! Hey, {FF81}! We haven't seen everything yet!

I... NEED... SOULS... GIVE ME... YOURS... ...{FF82}... {FF82}.  You're awake... As I'd thought, there is no way for humans to escape that light today... If I hadn't been here, that light would have stolen your soul, too. But, you aren't the only one. All humans have forgotten their souls. ...Do you wonder who I am? This is not the first time our paths have crossed, {FF82}. My name is Kinap. Please accept my apologies for what happened last time. However, this time I have come to warn you of this city's coming catastrophe... It seems I must hurry. There is someone thirsting for human souls, and that light was its doing... At this rate, the souls of all who live in this city shall become his. While I can see that the day is coming, I am powerless to stop it. I need your help. But, right now you cannot understand me or the light that is stealing souls. Therefore, I invite you on a Vision Quest. Your journey into the past begins here. Vision Quests are how souls communicate. Your own soul will touch with souls that have completed their lives on this world. You will learn the truth you need to know during this time. At this point, you will be meeting the soul of a man named Urabe. You will become Urabe, and relive part of his own life. However, the Vision Quest is a perilous journey. Death within the vision means death for you, {FF81} {FF82}. Now, go. Open your eyes to the memories laid out before you. Let me know if this message appears - MM ...Ah, it's you... ...Algon NS, right? I'm on my way there right now. Doesn't matter... The Phantom Society is my enemy, too. Think of it this way...

Let's just hurry up and cut off that damn noise. Well... Hey look, maybe you can stop it from that PC. Let's see... Huh, password? This PC's locked. We can't stop anything while it's like this. What!? Then why'd we come all the way here! ...It doesn't look like even {FF81} can crack it. So what can we do? At this rate... What!? You can't make it work? Then what are we supposed to do!? I'd suggest trying... this. Huh!? Who's there!? S-Sukeroku... I destroyed the main power source. That should calm down the guys above. What are you doing here, Sukeroku? Hm? You're here to investigate the unknown disease, too? Yes. And since you Kuzunoha are here, that means the unknown disease is being caused by Phantom, right? I don't know for certain, but it's only natural to think so. The timing's just too perfect. Also, they're the only ones with enough resources to have a cold sleep chamber like this ready. Cold sleep? You mean, like cryogenic stasis? It seems they stuffed the victims of the unknown disease inside here. I don't know why, though... But it seems you've learned a bit about the unknown disease. I suggest you turn your focus to Krypto. Krypto... The chip inside the Amami City PCs? Why would we look there? I'm afraid I don't know the details. Madam just told me to tell you. Well, I don't see any other traces of Phantom here, so my business here is concluded... I'll see you around. Krypto... The infected people had their souls stolen by demons, right? What could Krypto have to do with it...? Are they trying to use us or something? Nemissa doesn't appreciate being sent to go fetch.  I don't think it's like that. We can trust Madam Ginko. It's definitely something we should check out. Anyway, let's get out of here. We need to take your father home. Brother, Hitomi... Thank you so much. Cheer up, Tomoko. I'm sure he'll get better. Yeah... I hope so... He's sleeping quietly... First Tomoko, then him... Why is this happening to my family...? Don't worry, Mrs. {FF82}, It's not like it's a terminal disease... I'm sure he'll be all right. You're right... I need to be strong right now. I'll trust your words. But please, don't be so reckless. Oh, don't worry about me. No matter what demon comes along-- Oh, don't worry... E-Excuse us. {FF81}, let's go. Who are you guys? What do you think you're doing on our streets? Don't tell me you punks are trying to stop me, too! Get outta my face, or you're gonna be kissin' the pavement! Ah... Are you Nose? Nose...! AHAHAHA! Nose's dead, baby. Before you is the man who exchanged his soul for a never-ending rush. The eternal rider, the legendary Speed Demon! Wha... I'm going to die...? Again? What a drag... Hahaha. But hear this... This city... The place that turned me into this. This city will never sleep easy... How pathetic. He couldn't control his desires. He couldn't master his need to go faster, and he lost his own soul... A human that transformed into a demon... It happens sometimes. Um... I don't think it's all that common... Shhhh!  Was someone watching us just now? You must not run. You have yet to hear the voice of this soul. Return... I welcome you, {FF82}. If you wish, I can heal your wounded body and remember how you lived. Close your eyes. I pray for your luck. (SAVE point planned here) {FF81}, I can heal your wounds, if you wish. (You cannot be healed yet) Then farewell... I pray for your luck. ...It seems Tiamat is the one sleeping here. The power of the grand sea... If she is fully awakened, even I might not be able to stop her... My choice, huh. Well... If I'm to defeat her, fighting her now before she fully awakens is my best bet. Now! O, ancient goddess Tiamat! I challenge you! Begone from here without a curse! ...WHY DOST THOU AWAKEN ME? I HAVE LONG FORGOTTEN BATTLE... FOOLISH ONE... THE POWER OF MAN IS NOT ENOUGH TO DEFEAT ME... Yeah, I shouldn't rush things. I should check out Apsu, as well. Phew... That was tough. And she wasn't even completely awake yet, either... I wish I could have made her my demon ally, but... That wasn't really a likely outcome. Still, does the main system really need this much space? Manitou... That's what he called it... ...CURSED DESCENDANT OF AMEL, THINKEST THOU I COULD BE KILLED? Tiamat!? I AM POWER. MY SHAPE MAY CHANGE, BUT I SHALL NEVER DISAPPEAR. FOOLISH DESCENDANT OF AMEL, CURSED BEING OF FLESH. FEEL THE WRATH OF YOUR OWN SIN...... ......!? cough cough cough What the? The air's... N-No... What's- This can't be! I'm being pulled in... Ugh... ...I won... And yet... Why...? I still... have to... ...It seems Apsu is the one sleeping here. A water that created all... What kind of power awaits me...? My choice, huh. If I'm to defeat him, fighting him before he fully awakens is my only chance. I need to do this now. O, ancient god Apsu! Heed my call!  I challenge you! Return to the darkness where neither time nor light exist! ...SHE WHO WAS BORN FROM CURSED BLOOD... TURNEST THY BLADE ON ME...? THOUGH IT BE AGES SINCE LAST I FOUGHT, I STILL SHALL NOT LOSE TO THEE... Yeah, I shouldn't rush things. Let me go check out Tiamat, as well. Phew... That was tough. I'm glad he hadn't completely awakened yet...  It would've been nice if he became my demon ally, but I don't think there was any realistic way that would have happened. Still, does the main system really need this much space? Manitou... That's what he called it... ...THINKEST THOU THAT MAN CAN END THE LIFE OF A GOD? Apsu!? I AM POWER. MY SHAPE MAY CHANGE, BUT I SHALL NEVER DISAPPEAR. FOOLISH DESCENDANT OF AMEL, CURSED BEING OF FLESH. TAKE THE RETRIBUTION FOR TURNING THY BLADE ON ME... ......!? cough cough cough What the? The air's... N-No... What's- This can't be! I'm being pulled in... ...I won... And yet... Why...? I still... have to... The woman who lived between gods and demons made a grave mistake in the end. The god died, but so did she. Man and god... If the harmony is in ruins, the skies will crack in violent turmoil... No matter what day and age, this never changes. Manitou is deep within Mother Earth, in a place where the voice of Father Sun cannot reach. Stealing away all life from humans in this land... Man and Manitou... One must perish... They cannot both live in harmony. {FF82}. You are the son of man, born from the land. Thus, you should live as the son of man. Find your path. Nemissa too, will one day awaken to her fate. The moment of truth is close. Now, show me your soul's way of life, {FF81} {FF82}... The voices the warriors left behind are all with you. Now go, {FF82}. ...{FF81}. ...Wake up. {FF81}! ...Are you with us again? Ugh, what's up with this!? I got kicked out right at the beginning. So what'd you learn this time? {FF80}... Wh-What did you...? What? I just told you, remember? He was on a Vision Quest. Oh, er, sorry. To tell you the truth, I'm still not sure I believe everything yet... When I was reading the files on the Krypto chip, I thought they were using ""souls"" as code for something else. Reliving someone else's memories through their soul is... a bit hard for me to comprehend. Well, it really doesn't matter whether you understand or not. So, what are we going to do now? We may know the secret of the Krypto chip, but that's all academic if we just sit here twiddling our thumbs. That's true, but what exactly is our next move? Leaking this to the internet isn't going to work. Everyone will just dismiss it as an obvious fake. Well, that's for certain, but that's not our only option. I still have some cards left to play. Just sit back. Time to show them that hackers really ARE a threat to their system security. Welcome to the User Counter. Uh, now's not the time to be playing Paradigm X! According to that doc for the Krypto chip, they're carrying stolen souls through the net, right? In other words, the carriers are like cargo trucks hauling souls to Algon Soft's main server. Paradigm X here is on the same server. I'm going to insert a virus and bring Paradigm X and the soul-stealing superhighway down. C-Can you do that? All I need to do is have access to the main system... Which I do. Oh yeah, from when you were working for Algon Soft... Unauthorized personnel are not allowed into the main system. Please enter your password. PASSWORD BURNSESAME Verifying.................. Access granted. Phew, all I need to do is upload the virus and I'm done. All right! We'll show that Kadokura guy who's boss! We might also be able to clear up the misunderstanding with Lunch and the rest of the Spookies members. I originally developed this code to be used as a vaccine. In the end, it's now a virus... Viruses can be vaccines and vaccines can be viruses, it all depends on how you want to use the code. This bad boy will become Amami City's--and Spookies'--vaccine. Uploading now. Huh? Is something wrong? It looks like it stopped. Muahahaha. Missed it by THAT much. What a shame, Sakurai. Dammit! Kadokura! This is your doing, isn't it? So what were you trying to do with this, Sakurai? Were you trying to shut down the soul transfer network? Tsk tsk! That's so like you, just as I thought. No, just as I planned... Didn't you wonder why your password still worked? MUAHAHAHA! Dammit! He played us the entire time! Aw, poor Sakurai. If you'd only followed orders, you'd never have to taste such crushing defeat. Ugh! What an arrogant jackass! I hate him so much! What are you scheming!? Why are you gathering souls, anyway!? ...What, you actually had members who stuck by you? Good for you, Sakurai. Answer the question! Hahaha. Even if you kne...w... you... co...uld...n't... Hm? What's going on? Tch... Lo...sing control... Aga...in...!? Now why's... this thing... not working...!? Whe...re... is... Finn...egan...! Dammit... Amami Net is currently experiencing some server instability. Please log out of Paradigm X immediately and wait for further information. We cannot guarantee data integrity for your Paradigm X account if you continue playing. What happened? Kadokura stopped my virus transfer... Did something happen at the main building? Kyahaha! I don't know what happened, but this is going our way for once. We'll go to Algon's main building and check it out. That's going to be a problem. You're not wanted, but {FF80}'s face was all over the news. If they're having a problem that big, they're not going to notice us. Just act natural! The main building was on the north side of Nikamimon, wasn't it? C'mon, {FF81}. Let's go to Algon Soft. Now, let's go, {FF81}. You have no new messages. There is no new information on Summoner Net. Hello. Welcome to the Amami Net terminal. accessed at this time. Unfortunately, you cannot save at this time. Unfortunately, you cannot Install at this time. You have 1 new message. Brother, this is a test mail. Did you get it? No need to respond. Bye. There are no new messages. Thank you for using this terminal. URRRRRRRGH... GAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHH! Tch. This tomato can of a demon killed Judah? Looks like I'd been giving that guy more respect than he deserved... That demon... Did you kill it? Who are you? What are you two doing here? What are YOU doing here!? Is this part of Phantom's plans? (Shh! Quiet!) Not only do you know about the Society, but you also seem to know our goals... You're Kuzunoha, right? Kuzunoha...? Who's that? Um, we're... Don't bother. It'll all be meaningless once you're dead. Now you'll curse the day you ran into Finnegan. Why are you acting so tough!? We'll teach you to show some respect! Hahaha! Do you really think I'd waste my time on kids like you? Don't worry. They're more than enough to kill you small-timers. Well, you kids have fun... Fun for the rest of your lives! Muahahahaha... What's with that guy!? That was iiiincredibly ruuuude! That no-good, shades-wearing jerk! Who does he think he is? Hey! Get out of my way! Huh!? Finnegan, huh...? He's got quite  a nice body... Maybe I'll try a built one like him next time. Who are you? What are you talking about? How long have you been here? I've been watching for a while. I saw your fight. That was pretty impressive stuff for a bunch of kids. A while? So that's why it felt like we were being watched on the way here... Are you a member of Phantom? Sorry, Miss. My name's Sukeroku. I'm the Kuzunoha he was talking about. But let's talk about who you are. You're not Phantom, and you're not Kuzunoha. Yet, the boy's a Summoner... Care to fill me in? W-We're... Well... How should I say this...? You don't have to tell me now if you don't want. Anyhow, if you're taking on Phantom, I bear you no ill will. You see, I'm here because I heard my tomboy of a partner was somewhere in this general area. I'm looking for her... Her name's Rei Reiho. Have you come across her? Hm... I've never met anyone like that... So, is she your lover or something? Our relationship is a bit too complicated to describe to you kids. {FF84}{FF80}? It's me, Spooky. Where are you?{FF85} {FF84}I worked a deal with a certain group. I've got some good news for you and your COMP. I'll explain it to you in person. Head back to the HQ.{FF85} Sorry for any inconvenience I caused. If we're both dealing with Phantom, I'm sure we'll meet again. Take care! Kuzunoha... Hmmm, that name appears on Summoner Net, too. I didn't think there were others who were fighting the Phantom Society besides us... Well, we can't spend any more time standing around thinking. Let's go back to the HQ. We need to hear what Leader has to say. Where are we? This place is just a big garbage heap. What could we possibly find that would be of value here? Welcome, young Summoner... You who... possess... a soul... like mine... Here lies my... COMP... Now... it is... but a corpse... resting... in peace... It can... no longer... play its tune... but... if my demons lie within... please... awaken them... from their slumber... Here... further below... {FF81}, look! saxophone-shaped COMP in a pile of garbage. You took the Memory Card that was inside the COMP. With the Memory Card inserted into your COMP, you can now have a stock of up to 12 demon allies. Now... I have... no further attachment... to this world... Now... I shall just... fade away... However... before that happens... young Summoner... can you... tell me... how... How should... I... have lived...? ...... He disappeared... That ghost... He wanted you to have that Memory Card... But... it seemed like there was something else that he wanted, too... The shuttle is not functioning. All right, we should be able to get to the Amami Float using this shuttle. Let's hurry. I'm really worried about Yu-Ichi. Tch. Who the hell would be calling us now? Hey, it's your phone, {FF80}. {FF84}So, now I know your name, {FF82}. I see the message got to you.{FF85} That's Finnegan's voice! {FF84}I'm glad you accepted my challenge, but what's this bullcrap!? You'd send a brat like this in your place? I came here to settle the score with you. If you're not up for that, I'll have to devise other ways to entertain myself. If you value this kid's life, get to the  materials storeroom before I get bored. Just you and the girl. This is your last warning.{FF85} That call came from Yu-Ichi's phone... That goddamn idiot! He practically volunteered to become a hostage! What do we do? If we all go, he's gonna kill Yu-Ichi! It looks like trusting it to these two is our best option... I'm sorry to have to ask this of you, but will you go? No problem. Going alone is better for me anyway. It's easier to move without the extra weigh-- Er, you'll just have to wait a little bit extra... We'll do our best and make sure we bring Yu-Ichi back. I'm counting on you, {FF80}. Hey, {FF81}, look. There's another shuttle here. Yu-Ichi must have used that one. Finnegan said to meet him at the materials storeroom, right? Let's go. The network is functioning normally... The network is currently offline... The network is functioning normally... The network is currently offline... The network is functioning normally... The network is currently offline... ""Welcome to Paradigm X!"" Now let's go, {FF81}. There is new information on Summoner Net. You have no new messages RE: Dr. Thrill's location We have confirmed his whereabouts. He is performing research at the Primate Intelligence Lab in Nikamimon. We have no plans to interfere with him. {FF81}, let's hurry to the Akane Mall and bring your father home. ...So Paradigm X is the common factor. We'll need to research some more before we can say anything, but... ...Speaking of which, how's your own investigation going? Well, we've been so busy all of a sudden, I haven't really made much progress... But I did get my hands on some interesting data yesterday. I'm working on finding evidence right now. So you finally found it? Hahaha, nice. You really are persistent, you know. Heh. Was that a compliment? ...Oh, hey, {FF80}. What's up, Hitomi? Everything okay at Akane Mall? Sorry I can't help with that. ...Let's get going, Leader. Okay. We'll see you two later. Krypto!? The Krypto Chip is connected to the disease? It's possible, right? Like Paradigm X, the Krypto Chip is only used in Amami City. I see... It's worth checking out. Hey, Lunch, show me the Krypto Chip that was in this PC. Huh? What're you talking about? Don't play games with me. You swapped it out for the prototype chip your dad was talking about, didn't you? Heh heh... I can't fool you, huh? sigh The instant I take my eyes off you... Don't get on my case. If the Krypto Chip's the cause of this disease, then I just saved everyone here. Jury's still out on that, Lunch. Don't go patting yourself on the back just yet. Anyway, open it. Hi... What are you doing...?  Y-Yu-Ichi! You're back!? Yu-Ichi! Are you okay? ...Yeah...... I'm fine... ...Great. All this peace and quiet was getting on my nerves. Six! Wh-What? Look, I'm glad you're back, too... That's right, I haven't told him yet. You see, the recent wave of-- It's okay... Don't mind me... I'll just watch...... Hm? O-Okay. Then... just sit back and learn something. All right, Lunch. Take it apart. Gotcha. Leave it to me... ...And, there we go. Huh!? Is something moving!? H-Hey, what was that!? Do you know what this orb-like thing in the middle there is? No. I've never seen a chip like this. I'd almost say... it looks organic...? Huh!? Hang on, didn't you guys see that weird pink insect!? What're you talking about? I'm looking inside the chip, I wasn't paying attention to insects in the room. It flew out of the chip! Just now! You didn't see it!? What did? It was pretty... I've never seen anything so beautiful... You saw it too, right!? Yeah...... It was really beautiful... Yu-Ichi's the only other person who saw it? What's going on? Y'know, just this one chip isn't going to help anything... These chips are manufactured at Algon Microelectronics just north of here, right? Why don't we sneak in? If we see how they're producing these things, we might learn something. Yeah, let's do that. There's definitely something weird about that chip. There's got to be a secret. Hold on, you two. Lunch's father works at Algon Microelectronics. If we sneak in, we could cause trouble for him... No, that's a great idea. H-Hey. Lunch, you sure about this? If the Krypto Chip is causing this strange disease, then I want to see it with my own eyes. If you guys don't want to go there, I'll do it myself. Then if Lunch is okay with this, let's do it. We don't want to cause trouble, right? ...Fine. Yu-Ichi, what are you going to do? I'll go...... ...I see. All right, let's get moving. {FF80}, what're you doing? Let's go. You have no new messages. RE: Dr. Thrill's location We have confirmed his whereabouts. He is performing research at the Primate Intelligence Lab in Nikamimon. We have no plans to interfere with him. Let's go. Algon Microelectronics is north of here. You have no new messages. RE: Dr. Thrill's location We have confirmed his whereabouts.

He is performing research at the Primate Intelligence Lab in Nikamimon. We have no plans to interfere with him. {FF81}, let's go to Algon's main building and see what happened. A barrier? You couldn't get inside? Something's up for sure. We need to get in there. Something went wrong and set off their heavy defenses, and now the entire building's covered in a barrier. You're right, something's got to be going on, but there's no way for us to see. If only there was another way in... Another way...... Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm... Aha! Hey, Leader. Paradigm X is kept on Algon's main whatchamacallit, right? You mean the main server? Yeah, I said that. And this server's inside Algon's main building, right? So all we need to do is pass through Paradigm X and exit on that side. You mean that crazy cyber-dive you just did? Can you do that? I've never tried. But don't worry, I'm sure it'll work. All right, {FF81}, let's jump into Paradigm X and find a place we can access the main server from. You have no new messages. RE: Dr. Thrill's location We have confirmed his whereabouts. He is performing research at the Primate Intelligence Lab in Nikamimon. We have no plans to interfere with him. You have no new messages. There is no new information on Summoner Net. Oh, it's Yu-Ichi! You came back? ...... Huh...? Where's Leader? Isn't he here? ...... Huh? Hey, we're not gonna get anywhere if you don't speak up. Say something. ...We have your three partners. If you want to save them, the two of you must come to the Amami Monolith. What!? What are you saying? We have your three partners. If you want to save them, the two of you must come-- Hey, what's wrong-- It's no use talking to him. I heard a Dark Summoner was spotted around here, so I came to look, but it seems I was too late. You're... What do you mean, ""no use""? He's been brainwashed. To put it another way, he's a messenger of the Phantom Society. He's... Then is what he's saying true? Unfortunately, yes. This place was attacked while you were gone. But brainwashing takes time. Do you know when he could have been programmed by them? ......The Amami Float! He was caught by Finnegan, and... ...He's been brainwashed ever since then...? This is a trap aimed squarely at you. Sorry, but we can't simply lend you a hand here... I'm not asking for your help, either! {FF81}, let's go save them! Hold on. You're going to go and get yourselves killed? No! We're going to save them all. They're my friends! I can't abandon the people we've fought alongside! ...I'm surprised to hear something like that from a demon like you... ...Very well. I'll make sure this boy is safe. You won't have to worry about him. The Amami Monolith is on the west end of Nikamimon. ...So you DO know me...... I've done my homework. Of course, I know Hitomi as well... But, I can only sense the demon's soul from within her body. Hitomi's soul is dwindling. {FF81}, at this rate Hitomi's soul will be crushed by the other within her. You will never see her again... I don't know what to do about it, either. There may not be a solution for this situation. But I thought you had a right to know that it was happening. ...... Come on, {FF81}, let's go to the Amami Monolith. You have no new messages. There is no new information on Summoner Net. {FF81}, we're hurrying to the Amami Monolith. You have no new messages. There is no new information on Summoner Net. {FF81}, let's go to Algon Microelectronics. Lunch's dad said that to get to Nikamimon, we should go from the west end of Shibahama, right? Let's go. You have no new messages. There is no new information on Summoner Net. Muahahahaha! Congratulations on making it this far! At least you are able to rise to simian levels of intelligence. You're expecting a giant banana? There's no such thing! KYAHAHAHAHAHAAAA! You're part of Phantom, aren't you?Who exactly are you? Phantom? Oh, those guys... Don't lump me in with those pedestrians. I'm not in their group. I simply loaned them my genius for a brief period. And because of that, I find myself and my research constantly under duress from  Summoners. Once I made that realization, I also found my solution! An eye for an eye! Tooth for a tooth! A Summoner for a Summoner! And my work is finally complete! I have created an unfailingly loyal Summoner to do my bidding! Show yourself, Romero! It is time for you to shine! Ook! Ook! Ook! Oook! When I kill you, the Doctor will be pleased! Ook! sniffle That's my boy! It chokes me up to see the monkey that you've become, Romero! Puny Summoner! Your mom's so fat and hated, when she goes out, nobody wants to talk to the 800-pound gorilla in the room. Excellent! You've already unleashed your devastating psychological attacks! His will is breaking down! That seems to be all you runts can handle. I'll finish thrashing you another time. Ook! No, Romero! You must fight them now! They can't be allowed to leave! My apologies! I didn't realize that they posed such a threat. Their appearance led me to believe otherwise. Ook ook! Ook ook! I'd tell you to prepare yourselves, but no defense can possibly spare you from my ultimate attack! Ook! Ook! Doctor, doctor! Some slow-looking person has just trespassed onto the premises!  What's that? Oh, Romero, you must be more careful with your word choices. I didn't realize that you meant slow as in idiotic. I'm sorry. Ook. I'll try to be more clear when I speak. I'm shocked that you didn't just give up. Romero, just put them out of their misery. Ook! Ook! As you wish, Doctor! Ook? You again? This is getting boring. Ugh. Just get this over with, Romero. I'm going to take a nap or stare at my Jacob's Ladder. Doctor, this is a pretty unfair confrontation. Oook... Oh well. I suppose we should get this eventuality over with. Oook. Doctor, these guys are hopeless. Can you maybe turn a venus flytrap into an incompetent Summoner to beat them? I know that you are beyond their capabilities, but I can't create a minion for an underling. That's just absurd. But I'm not even using .009 of my brain power, and they're still woefully outmatched! How can you even summon? You're more like a ...none-oner! Ookahaha! Maybe they've got failure mutations on their dominant alleles.  That would literally make them born losers! Phwahahahaha! Well, loser, time to start acting like one. Get lost! Haven't you been humiliated throughly enough yet? Did a wayward bolt destroy your brain's shame center? Surely you see that even with infinite time and infinite monkeys, you'd never devise a way to defeat Romero. Stop wasting everyone's time and just leave! Make sure that you regret your existence as well! grunt Ook... Ooook. Blarg... Inconceivable! Romero was raised on riddles, and yet, he was somehow defeated by them... This isn't good! If his ego continues to degrade at its current rate, he's going to die! Your super intelligence is turning into your Achilles' Heel! Ooooooook... I am slain...  Excellent, Romero! What a cunning plan! You've exploited humans' kindness towards endangered animals to gain the upper hand! Press your advantage and finish the cretins, Romero! Ook! Ook! You sowed the storm. Now reap the whirlwind! Wh-What!? Double damnation! Romero's ploy didn't even faze him! He feels nothing at all for animals! Has he no conscience!? I guess riddles and tricks won't work on you. Very well, we shall settle this Summoner to Summoner then! H-He lost again... Even though I turned him into a Summoner, it appears you finally brought the monkey out of him... ...That's pretty heartless, Doctor. I tried my best, and I employed the tactics learned from your tutelage. If I'm to blame, one could posit that you are culpable for my failure as well. And could you not call me a monkey? Whaaaa? How dare you get uppity on me, you failure!? Don't you talk back to me, monkey! So that's how it is. Ook. I see now. I followed your orders and guidance because I thought of you as my father, Doctor. But that thought has perished today. I shall live as I please now! I appreciate your role you had in my development, but we shall never speak to one another again. Fine! Leave! See if I care! Why does everyone I work with have to get such an attitude? No gratitude! I'm going home where I don't have to think about you ingrates any more! Out of my way, morons! Ook! Jungle law dictates that the strong must lead. I'm no longer a jungle creature, but that rule seems valid now. I no longer follow the rule of Dr. Thrill. If you need assistance with something that he made, I can help you. You lost Zoma, correct? Let me give you this... This is the Intelligence Training Program. Answer the question correctly in 10 seconds or less to proceed to the 2nd floor. Look closely at the board in front of you. Now... An incorrect monkey is an inferior monkey. Inferior monkeys must be punished. Incorrectness is the sibling of failure. Superior monkeys do not tolerate failure, because failure is punished. A feeble mind makes for a feeble monkey. You will be punished in order to purge that weakness from your body. A slow monkey is a worthless monkey. Not answering is as bad as answering incorrectly. Face your punishment! That is correct. You have earned the right to proceed to the 2nd floor. Permission to enter the 2nd floor has already been granted. This is the Intelligence Training Program. Answer the question correctly in 10 seconds or less to proceed to the 3rd floor. Pay attention to the board in front of you. Now... This punishment will hurt the Intelligence Training System more than it will hurt you, monkey. Incorrect choices here will lead to incorrect choices in life. You must be punished to break those habits, monkey. In the Intelligence Training System, pain is the sensation of mental weakness fleeing the body. Idle monkey hands are a disgrace! That is correct. You have earned the right to proceed to the 3rd floor. Permission to enter the 3rd floor has already been granted. This is the Intelligence Training Program. Answer the question correctly in 10 seconds or less to enter the laboratory. Examine the board in front of you carefully. Now... In this age of universal connectivity, being wrong in public is more shameful than any prior point in history. You will be punished! To choose wrong is to choose punishment. Voicing incorrect opinions can be a fate worse than death. At no point did you even approach the correct answer. You will be punished, and I wish for mercy upon your soul. You shouldn't get in the habit of being a tardy monkey. A monkey who is tardy more than once is, well... disgraceful.  That is correct. You have earned the right to enter the laboratory. Permission to enter the laboratory has already been granted. Our next story tonight concerns the upcoming virtual city, ""Paradigm X."" While its public opening is coming soon, creator Algon Soft is reportedly being flooded with beta applications. The number of users is so great that the company is unable to shut down the site for new user registrations. We will continue our coverage of the public release of Paradigm X as the story unfolds... Hey, how about here...? You're a member of the great hacker group, the Spookies. You ought to be able to pull this off, at least. See? It's deserted around this terminal. It's the perfect place to do a little remote hacking, don't you think? Haha, good luck. Leader's already found where the winners' list is stored on their server... ...So just get in there and overwrite one of the winning names with yours. We can't rely on luck to get us into the Paradigm X beta. I doubt we'd win that lottery... Haha, thanks. Leader's already found where the list of winners is kept on their server, so just overwrite one of the names there. So, this is the list of lucky winners who are getting into the beta... Password accepted. Re-Registering Paradigm X Beta entry. Huh? Did it work? Once you're on the list, the license should be sent to your home email... Wait, hold on. There's still something on the screen... ......{FF81} {FF82}... Bearer of a strong soul... We meet at last... Huh? Who's this? This guy knows you? What's going on? My name is Kinap. You are in danger. Leave now. The authorities are on their way. ""Kinap...""? I cannot speak much now, but remember this: I will appear before you again... I am always watching you. Remember this: I will appear before you again... Who was that...? He knew your name. That's weird, huh? Ah! Oh... Geez... That's just your phone. {FF84}Hi, brother! It's me, Tomoko! I have big news! It's...... Heehee, it's big! Hurry up and come home! Hurry!{FF85} Oh, was that Tomoko? She sure sounded happy. Did something good happen? Well... I wonder if your hack's taken effect yet. Let's get back to your house. Nice try. I heard her voice from here. She sure sounded happy, though. Well... I wonder if your hack's taken effect yet. Let's get back to your house. Hm? Ah, {FF81}. You're home. {FF81}'s father. A hardworking salaryman and a loving dad. He likes new things. Tomoko was looking for you earlier... Oh, speak of the devil. Hey, brother! Tomoko {FF82}. {FF81}'s little sister. A lively third-year in middle school. Oh, Hitomi's here, too! Hello! It's been a while, Tomoko. You look happy. Did you get good news? Yeah! Was it obvious? Big, big news! Tah-dah! One of us is lucky enough to get into the Paradigm X beta test! Congrats, {FF81}! Is that so? Nice, {FF81}!

Bye. There are no new messages. Thank you for using this terminal. Hello. Welcome to the Amami Net terminal. You have 1 new message. Brother, this is a test mail. Did you get it? No need to respond. Bye. There are no new messages. Thank you for using this terminal. This... is Manitou...? I see... I can tell. Manitou's voice... I can feel it... echoing within me... Screaming... It's in... pain? ...!? No, these voices are... the souls. Everyone's crying... What about Manitou? ...... It's... not listening to me anymore. Hahaha... That's right. Keep going... Huh!? That voice... Heehahahaha! Yes... More! More! More souls... Hahahahaha! Kadokura! He's above us!? Fantastic... Fantastic! I-I feel... like my body's going to burst... The souls are gathering... The power is flowing into me! Hahahahahaha! Kadokura... Do you know what you're doing? Now, my Spores... beautiful lights from Manitou... Release the Carriers! Lead all the souls in the world to Manitou! Hahahahaha! Kinap knew this would happen. That's why he tried to seal it away. That's why he pulled Nemissa out. Because... Manitou can no longer live in harmony with mankind... Because the two will only destroy one another... Heehahahahahahaha! Souls... Soooooooouls! The hearts of man have become weak. Anxiety... sadness... hatred... So weak, one's own emotions can easily crush them... Right now, {FF81}, Manitou can only see Kadokura. We need to defeat him before we can stop Manitou. Let's do it... We can finally end this! I WANT... I... WANT... souls... Give me... more... More... g-give m-me... soulssssssssss... Ahahaha... Manitou... Have you had enough... to eat...? Do you still want... more souls...? Urrrrgh... There is a soul here... now... Manitou... Swallow... Give me souls... eternity... HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA! I can hear it... Manitou's voice... Now that Kadokura is gone... My voice is reaching it... Manitou... Let's go home. Back to the world we belong in... You don't have to suffer any more... {FF81}... I want to be with you. With Hitomi... With everyone in the Spookies... I want to stay with you forever. But, I can't... Mankind's souls today can't withstand us... No matter how much we might want it... They just can't... Mankind isn't wrong. But neither is Manitou. No one is in the wrong here. It's just... we can't coexist. That's all there is to it. I need to return to Manitou. When I do, Manitou can finally die. That's what Manitou wants as well... This... is my purpose. I am... the song of death that Manitou must sing. Maybe today... is my real birthday. I won't forget... about you... So I'm sure we'll... ......... Hitomi... Wake up... ...Hey, how about here? You're a member of the great hacker group, the Spookies. You ought to be able to pull this off, at least. Hahaha... I'm just kidding. You remember, don't you? That day... You and me, hacking here... And then we met Kinap... That's when it all started. All of it. Ha ha... And then Tomoko called you, so excited about Paradigm X, remember? {FF84}Oh, hello? Brother? It's me, Tomoko!{FF85} {FF84}A guy named Six just called. He said you should hurry up. Something about a moving truck coming soon, so you need to get going. That's all I have to tell you. Bye!{FF85} A message from Six, huh? If everybody else is getting ready, we need to get over there, too. Ooooh! {FF80}! Hitomi! It's been a while! Man, you guys are late. What were you doing? Making memories. If anything, you guys are too early. Well, I've got the movers coming to my place, too, so... There used to be a lot of talk about how this ""model city"" would be perfect, but it ended in a flash. ...Everyone's leaving, huh? I liked being a Spooky... Don't jump to conclusions. We're still us, right? Nothing's gonna change. He's right. We're moving to new homes, but our HQ is still right here. It always will be. I won't forget. About you all... About Leader... Then I'm sure we'll meet again. Sometime, somewhere... I'm looking forward to seeing how much you guys change in the meantime. ...You're right. This isn't ""goodbye,"" it's ""until we meet again."" ...They're all gone. We should get going, too... ...... When Nemissa left me, she said, ""I'm sure we'll meet again..."" So I didn't say goodbye. You're taking that with you, right? We carry everything that happened inside of us. It'll be with us, forever. Let's go. We're taking our first steps. We still have a path to walk... What are you going to do now, Lunch? I've decided to go with Dad. I've been thinking about this for a long time... I'm thinking of being a reporter. A reporter? You? There's still a lot in this world that I don't know about. I want to see it all. What about you? Nothing special. My parents are moving back in with my grandparents. They might set up shop again there. I can't just leave 'em. Me, I'll take it easy for a while. I'm becoming a hacker! A super-hacker like Spooky! Yeah? Well, you know what, I really think you can. R-Really? You serious, Six!? I'm going to go to America with my father. I want to see where Nemissa was born... So, {FF81}, what are you going to do?  From: Unknown Everyone has worries and expectations about their futures. That is what makes it so hard to find a way of life. But unless you have one, you can't start walking your life's path. If you've found your own way of life, perhaps the Spookies aren't needed anymore. Even if our paths never cross again, as long as our memories remain, we are always together. You are not alone. ...Hey, how about here? You're a member of the great hacker group, the Spookies. You ought to be able to pull this off, at least. Hahaha... I'm just kidding. You remember, don't you? That day... You and me, hacking here... And then we met Kinap... That's when it all started. All of it. Ha ha... And then Tomoko called you, so excited about Paradigm X, remember? {FF84}Oh, hello? Brother? It's me, Tomoko!{FF85} {FF84}A guy named Six just called. He said you should hurry up. Something about a moving truck coming soon, so you need to get going. That's all I have to tell you. Bye!{FF85} A message from Six, huh? If everybody else is getting ready, we need to get over there, too. It looks like everybody's here. I guess we're a little late. ...Oh, yeah. I have to tell you something... When Nemissa left me, she said, ""I'm sure we'll meet again..."" So I didn't say goodbye. After all... We carry everything that happened within us. All those experiences will be with us forever. ...Now, let's go inside. They're all waiting for us. Ooooh! {FF80}! Hitomi! It's been a while! Man, you guys sure took your time. What kept you so long? Where's Leader? He's supposed to be coming today, isn't he? Yes, Rei called me. She said that he's doing all right. I still can't believe made it. He really had me worried there for a while. Well, by the sounds of things, he's going to be here. Er... Come to think of it, we haven't really apologized to him yet, have we? We said some horrible things to him, when we thought he'd betrayed us. Heh heh, yeah we did. But even with Leader coming back, we're disbanding the Spookies...? This ""model city"" is closing up, and we're going to be split up all over the place... Oh, Leader... ...Leader, are you sure you're okay now?  Yeah. I've made a good bit of recovery. Still, I didn't think any of you guys thought that much about your futures. Lunch, you're going to be a journalist, Six will take over the family business, and Yu-Ichi... You'll stay a hacker. Well, that's what we're gonna do. What about you, Leader? Yeah, Spooky! You're not gonna quit the hacking game, are you...? About that... I've been giving it some thought. In a sense, I've already died once. That experience really makes you think. When you die, you're truly alone. When I was there, I just blankly stared at my own life. And when I was all alone, lost with myself, a whole lot of questions started coming up. Like, who raised me, and who saved me, what I held dear... ...What I believe in, and, what I've learned and what I know. Being faced with these questions, one right after another... Something became clear to me. The people that I've made connections with... they're just as important as everything I've done with my life. And, now I'm thinking that I can go on living with that in mind... After all, I was once dead. ...I'm surprised you're able to think that way, Leader. Haha, you think so? But to tell you the truth, I don't imagine what I'm going to be doing is all that different than from before. Hey, have you changed or not? You're just as vague as ever. ...You're back, but Spookies is still being disbanded, huh... It may seem that way, but you don't need to worry. We, and all the people who helped us... We're all Spookies. That's who we are, and who we'll always be. Ooooh! {FF80}! Hitomi! It's been a while! Man, you guys are late. What were you doing? We were making memories. Sorry for being late. You're looking good, Leader. Yes, thanks to all of you. I'm fine now. You've treated me well, and that magic Rei used on me sure is working, haha. Oh, and today's the day {FF80} moves out, isn't it? It was tough packing all his things, since he never cleans up, but we managed to finish in time. Same here. Well, we're letting the movers do everything, though. There used to be a lot of talk about how this ""model city"" would be perfect, but it ended in a flash. Well, you know, we're the ones who ended it, hahaha. ...Everyone's leaving, huh? I liked being a Spooky... Hey, Leader. About shutting the doors on the Spookies... Are we really closing down? ...I'm not one to bother with formalities, but I thought it'd be best to cut everything cleanly. I'm really happy to know that you feel so strongly about the Spookies. But I don't want you to think of Spookies as your final destination. I've been thinking about this for a long time. I wanted to end the Spookies when you'd all found your paths in life. And now, I believe that this is that time. We might be splitting up, but that doesn't end our friendships. I'm not going to forget. About Spookies... Or all of you... Then I'm sure we'll meet again. Sometime, somewhere... I'm looking forward to seeing how much you guys change in the meantime. ...You're right. This isn't ""goodbye,"" it's ""until we meet again."" ...They're all gone. We should get going, too... ...... When Nemissa left me, she said, ""I'm sure we'll meet again..."" So I didn't say goodbye. You're taking that with you, right? We carry everything that happened inside of us. It'll be with us, forever. Let's go. We're taking our first steps. We still have a path to walk... What are you going to do now, Lunch? I've decided to go with Dad. I've been thinking about this for a long time... I'm thinking of being a reporter. A reporter? You? You know, that does sound like something you'd do. There's still a lot in this world that I don't know about. I want to see it all. What about you, Six? Nothing special. My parents are moving back in with my grandparents. They might set up shop again there. I can't just leave 'em. Me, I'll take it easy for a while. I'm becoming a hacker! A super-hacker like Spooky! Like me? That's flattering. Yeah? Well, you know what, I really think you can. R-Really? You serious, Six!? So, what're you gonna do, Leader? Well, what should I do? Are you gonna quit hacking? Haha, no. But things aren't going to be the way they were before. I won't be deceiving myself. I need to find out what my true purpose is... I'm sure there are many more villains in the world. There may come a time when I have to ask for your help again. I'm going to go to America with my father. I want to see where Nemissa was born... So, {FF81}, what are you going to do?  From: Unknown Even when the land changes shape, it does not change the fact that the land is man's home. Even when the means of communication between people change, it does not change the bonds that form between them. In the ever-flowing passage of time, we meet, part, and become new. Even then, everyone feels the kernel of self within their minds. That is the essence of the soul. And even without shape, I am inside you, waiting for the tomorrow that is to come. To you who lived with me: this is my song to you. ""Welcome to Paradigm X!"" Now let's go, {FF81}. There is new information on Summoner Net. You have no new messages. Urgent Notice: A large power surge has been confirmed on the top level of the Sea Ark. Its cause is unknown. Any Summoner looking to test his or her skills is welcome to investigate. Heeeeee! Hooooooooo! Hee! Ho! Hee! Ho! Hee-ho hee-ho! I'm the boss, King Frost!

Now, then... Why don't we get this party started, hm? Ahahahahahahaha! Urgh...... You... got balls...... Welcome to my boudoir, Mr. Cursed Summoner. I could have a use for you... But, if you're hanging around with that girl, then you must still be a little boy. Now, come... I'll show you what a real woman can do. Hm... You may have defeated me... but you'll never forget me... Ho ho. I never imagined a son of man would once more stand before me. Now then, let me see the extent of your power. .................. I-Incredible! I never imagined I would meet a human so strong! Hrmmm... I don't know if this decrepit old body of mine will be able to win, but I cannot simply ignore you! Hrm... You may be strong, but I, Lucifuge, will not lose. I may be old, but no mere human will defeat me! You appear to have some skill, but can you defeat me? I will show you the power of a true prince of hell! Bwahaha! You may be strong within the realms of man, but here your abilities are nothing to be proud of. Now... I will show you the power of Hell. Wow... You are really weak. I am honestly surprised to see you here. Your foolishness in challenging me will be your undoing! Urgh... I cannot believe... that I lost...... I must report... the existence... of a powerful human... Hmmmmm? Who's there? Hmm... I smell the scent of humanity. The scent of a fool, whose futile strength means nothing... But, still, I never imagined a day would come in which I might unleash my power once again... I am Beelzebub, the keeper of this corridor and the king of Hell. The five Manji of Time shall not be allowed to fall into your hands! Urrgh...... A terrifying human... However... your path... will only become harder... Urrrrrrgh...... Who can... stand a chance against you...? Terrifying son of man... No... You are too strong... to be called man...... Hey, there you are. This place is detached from reality, and serves as an arena to test your abilities as a Summoner. Beyond each of the numbered doors awaits a powerful foe. If you can collect the mysterious artifacts they hold, a new path will be opened to you. I am here to bear witness to your trials. Hey, there you are. So long. This place is detached from reality, and serves as an arena to test your abilities as a Summoner. Beyond each of the numbered doors awaits a powerful foe. If you can collect the mysterious artifacts they hold, a new path will be opened to you. You, bearer of the five Manji... You have earned the right to journey backwards in time. If you so wish... You may attempt to retake the path you have been walking, but with new powers... So, you have come here once more... You, who have tread the whole of the path twice over... Who, now, can compare to you? Who poses a challenge to you? The answer is ""no one,"" for there is no one left to fight.

Obviously, it's about YOUR pride, after you talked so big last time and totally failed to kill us. You call it a match, but really, you're just here trying to avenge your shameful defeat, aren't you? Say what you will. Everything will be settled soon enough. Kid, I don't know who you are, but where I come from, men don't hide behind girls when they fight. So why don't we settle this old school, one Summoner against another? Or are you too much of a coward to fight without hiding behind your girlfriend? Hey! What are you saying!? How do you think you can win without me!? All right, that's what I was hoping you'd say. I respect your spirit. ...Now we're on even conditions. There's no excuses now. ...Fine then. I'll sit this one out, but you'd better not lose. C'mon, kid! I'll show you what a real Summoner is made of! Heh... I didn't think... I'd be beaten by a kid like you...... But listen, kid... Don't think this is my true power... {FF81}, are you okay!? Geez, you really are reckless. Well, you won, so it's fine. Hmph, so in the end, you're just a kid. You can't really call yourself a Summoner. Hmph. What, you got a problem with me!? I'll burn you to a crisp with my magic! Watch your mouth! I'll freeze you to the bone with my magic! What, you got a problem!? My magic will shock you so bad, your body will be used as a battery! Enough talk! I'll show you the fearsome might of my demons! Ugh... It can't be... The great Finnegan defeated by this boy and girl...? C-Curse you... I'll remember this. One day, I'll avenge this defeat and you will rue this day... Look, {FF81}! It's Yu-Ichi!! Thank goodness! Yu-Ichi, you're safe! ...... We were worried about you, Yu-Ichi. Are you okay? Did they do anything to you? ...Hitomi? Why... Why are you here? Whaddya mean ""why""!? You ran off on your own and got captured, so we came to save you! You came... to save me? H-Hey, are you sure you're all right? You seem a bit out of it. He's gone through quite a bit today, of course he's a little shellshocked. We should go back. Everyone's worried. You idiot!! How stupid can you get!? ...... Tch, you run off on your own and then you end up like this! You're just slowing us all down! If you wanna die that badly, then find a way to do it without dragging the rest of us down with you! That's enough, Six. I'm sure he feels bad enough as it is. Let's leave it at that. Look, we're all safe, now. In the end that's all that counts, right? Sure, it's easy for you two to just wave it off, but think, what if someone died trying to save him? And for what? What does this punk even bring to the team!? What's the upside for having him jeopardize our lives, huh!? ...Sorry.  There. You happy now...? What!? This just nothing to you? Maybe I need to beat some understanding into your skull! That's enough, Six! Ease off of Yu-Ichi, he was just trying to help! He's right. Now isn't the time to get angry at Yu-Ichi. ...Oh, I try to be the voice of reason and that makes me the bad guy? You guys just don't get it. Any time you're in a team setting, once one guy decides to go it alone he jeopardizes the entire team. Pfft... You aren't even listening. Screw this... If you wanna throw a pity party, do it yourselves. I'm not dying for him. I'm out. Wait, Six! Let him go. He's not going to listen to anything once he's like that. What Six said wasn't wrong, though. We can't be taking crazy risks like that and not expect to pay for it. Yu-Ichi, we're good people, but the Phantom Society is made of people who don't bat an eyelash at the thought of killing others. ...Then, I'll quit. ...That's what everyone wants, right? ...Huh, are you listening? H-Hey, what's wrong with you? ...I just want to go home. We're done here, right...? Hmph... Well, we're done for right now, but not done with our mission... Leader, what should we do? Yu-Ichi's had an intense day. I'm sure he's tired. He probably should leave and take a rest. But listen here, Yu-Ichi. You're still a member of Spookies. We'll be waiting for you when you return. ...Bye. Man... Those two... What kind of selfish person can't deal with criticism without getting all mopey? He needs to grow up. ...Let's just return to HQ for now. We can talk about what to do once we're we're back... Haha, I just noticed how quiet it is here without those two. It's hard to believe this is the same place. Yeah, but we're also weaker as a group. So... What're we gonna do from here on out...? ...Hm? Hey, {FF80}, you got mail. Why haven't you read your mail yet?  Sheesh. Hurry up and check it. You have 1 new message. Message from ""Resident Administrative Bureau"".

Your ID's been deleted!? I don't know why it happened, but I know it isn't good. If you don't have an ID in this town, you're as good as dead. Amami City uses IDs for everything. We're just bits to them. You won't be able to use the terminals, get money from the bank, or even buy anything. You'll be totally locked down. This has gotta be Phantom's doing... That's the only logical explanation. So, they have control over Amami City itself...? But why would they be after {FF81}'s ID? Well, he's been fighting Phantom directly quite a bit recently. From their standpoint, he's a nuisance. It doesn't surprise me that they're trying to shut down the Summoner who's thwarting them. By freezing {FF80}'s movement, they are trying to hinder our operations... Or perhaps this is a warning... What're we gonna do, Leader? Without {FF80}, we're in a tight situation. Let me think... In the meantime, {FF80} and Hitomi, go bring Six back. We're dealing with some big shots. We need all the help we can get. I'll contact Yu-Ichi. Six's house is in the building on the east side of Nikamimon. You should be able to tell which one it is. Okay. We'll leave the ID problem to you.

This must be the reason why it's so cold. If we can defeat this demon... Wait! Hey {FF81}, don't you think this one is going to use ice attacks? We've got those insulated clothes back up top. Maybe we should put them on before we do this... Okay, but let's be careful... ...Hey, you! Quit being such a pest and knock off this freezing air already! Don't worry. Just leave everything to me and it'll all be okay. ...Hey, you! Quit being such a pest and knock off this freezing air already! wheeze Who are you...? I belong in the cold. The cold... It is where Gargan Zero belongs... Master Thrill ordered me to protect this place... Are you going to stand against me? There will be... no mercy. What are you even talking about?

Let's hurry and get out of here. W-Wait. We still need to find that thing Victor wanted us to look for. What the hell!? Who dares interrupt my vital studies!? ...A mere stripling!? You... You have some nerve to enter the lab of the glorious Dr. Thrill without permission! Nerve, I say! NERVE! I instructed Zero to let nobody through, did I not!? Just what the hell happened to her, huh? Hmmm...? What's that you've got there? I've seen it before. Now, what was it...? Oh! Oh-ho-ho! ...Oh. If that's what I think it is, I'm not going to like this one bit. Very well, allow me to inquisit a single question from you... Bah! Smug, cocksure brat! You're just going to yell that to the entire world, eh? Do you know what kind of humiliations I have suffered at the hands of Summoners!? The very thought...! I already know that getting involved with you lot is never going to turn out well for me. To be perfectly frank, I would love to beat you into a pulp, but... I believe a hasty retreat would be the smartest choice for now. You will rue the day we met! I will have revenge! Prevarication! You can't deceive me! You reek of the same scent as that awful Summoner who tormented me... Damn! You killed my Zero, didn't you? All she was doing was keeping me safe! You filth just love to antagonize me! I think I will have to retreat for now, but one day I will have you feel the shame that I feel right now! What the... What's his problem? He just shouted a lot of nonsense and left. {FF81}, look... Maybe this is what Victor wanted us to bring back to the Goumaden... Hello. Welcome to the Amami Net terminal. accessed at this time.     Thank you for using this terminal. Great, you're finally here. You guys got here fast. Is this where they make the chips? Look... That shining orb is getting covered... It looks like they're just putting on the finishing touches here. Where is that funky core actually made? That's right. The core isn't manufactured here. Algon Soft ships it here. Wh-Who said that!? I did! What are you doing here? How did you get inside? Y-You... Oh, I get it now... You're a member of the Society, aren't you? Society? I see... You're here for the same reason I am. Same reason? What are you talking about? You're here to investigate the secret of the Krypto chip, I assume. You think it's causing the unknown disease... You asshole! You knew all that and you didn't do anything about it!? Hey, give me a break! I only found out recently. If I'd known earlier, I wouldn't have let it happen. Yeah, right! You're the type of guy who backstabs other people just to get promoted! Because of you, Mom...! I'm assuming you're talking about when this factory was taken over, right? You're right. I did have to betray a lot of good people who'd helped me out during that situation. Do you know why? I didn't do it for money, power, or a better position. Well, then why the hell'd you do it!? ...My hands were tied. It was either betray them, or betray you and your mother. They threatened to kill you two if I didn't cooperate. I lost a lot of sleep over that decision... In the end, they left me no choice... I had to do as they asked. Even then, the strain it put on your mother was still too great... N-No way... You did that for Mom and me...? Listen, Junnosuke. Your father's never making that mistake again. Going along with the plans of evil people can only lead to evil things happening to you, after all... ...Excuse me if I'm butting in, but, what were you trying to learn here? I'm sure that you know most of what happens in this factory, since you work here. I had the same suspicions you guys did, and I wanted to learn about the Spore implanted in the chip. Spore? That's the term they have for that core. I only heard the factory manager mention it... I don't know what it is. Even within this factory, the specifications of that part are top secret. All data is stored in the Center Room. Tell us how to get to that Center Room! What are you planning on doing, Junnosuke? This has nothing to do with you. Over time, I slowly realized that there's a sinister organization behind all this stuff. But that's something for grown adults to handle. You kids have no real reason to actually fight something like this. Poking your heads into something like this just for fun or curiosity could very easily get you killed. Let this old man handle it. Leader, what's your call? Well, I can't deny that I did start this crusade out of curiosity in the beginning... I understand what you're saying, but Dad, we're already past the point of no return.  Even if we stop, they're not just going to ignore us. So, why don't you leave this to us? Besides, if I quit now... I don't know if I'd be able to apologize to Mom up in heaven. I see... Well, if you're that determined to see this through, then I won't say anything more... There's a locked door on the third floor. The Center Room's past that door. Great, let's go. If it's locked, we can just use Lunch's-- Shut uuuuup! That decoder won't unlock that door. Speaking of which, I can't believe you took that, too... What? You didn't make it, Lunch? Who says you have to unlock the door from the outside, though? It's more likely to be open if you have someone on the inside. Don't worry... I'll write it up as a machine error. ...Is it okay for you to do that? Hey, don't worry about me,  worry about yourselves. You picked the hard job. Keep an eye out for the Factory Manager. There's something unsettling about him. You definitely don't want to run into him. Thank you, mister. We're grateful for your assistance. All right, let's go, everyone. offline. Yo, {FF80}. Are you the one that unlocked this place? Unfortunately, this line isn't running right now. We won't be able to find anything out while it's off. Let's look somewhere else. ...Sure. See you guys around. Stay safe. offline. This line's shut down for scheduled cleaning... ...! Hey! This is a clean facility! Why're you walking around here in plain clothes!? You'll get dust in here! Get out NOW! Hey, {FF80}. Did you unlock the door? Sorry to give you bad news, but it looks like this line's offline. Hey, Six. Let's look somewhere else... Huh? I guess we should.

You made it here safely, too. Of course. Hmmm, so this is the Center Room... So? Figure anything out yet? Hey, there's no need to rush things. We just found a file. It's not opening. Is something wrong? It's a top secret file. It's obviously going to have heavy security on it. Can you hack it? Spooky... You can do it, right...? Yeah, I can hack it, but it's going to take time. There's several layers of security. We'd be caught before I finished. Well, what're we gonna do? We won't get another chance to get all the way here. Try using this program. It should be perfect for cracking passwords. Huh? What's that? It's the program in Dad's decoder I used back at the entrance. I'll give it a shot... Certification No: 00345KU808BJ Ver: 2.5 The Krypto Chip is a new CPU Chip designed by Kadokura and Algon Soft. It boasts tremendous processing power and reduced power usage, but its key feature is the ability to accumulate souls. The Krypto Chip's ability to harvest souls and the accumulation cycle is as follows. Inside the Krypto Chips are living elements called ""Spores"". These Spores spawn images with the ability to capture souls. They are known as ""Carriers"". Carriers are a lifeform with both electromagnetic and spiritual properties, allowing them to travel through the net. When a Carrier captures a soul, it will instinctively return to the parent body through an internet connection. Spore -This is the soul accumulation cycle the Krypto Chip uses. The following set-up appears to be the most optimal way of implementing the soul accumulation process. Supply every household with a machine with a Krypto Chip and have all of them connect to the internet. Humans using the PC will eventually have their souls harvested by the Carriers, and those souls will be taken to the parent body. This plan will allow the parent body to absorb a massive amount of souls with minimal time and effort. Humans who have had their souls harvested will end up in a catatonic, lifeless state. This concludes the summary of Krypto Chip's specifications and our plans for it. ""The Krypto Chip is incredibly useful in the Phantom Society's objective of collecting human souls."" Are you effin' kidding me? Harvesting souls!? This some kinda joke!? It's gotta be a dummy file, right? Right? That looks about right to me. They're using this chip to steal souls from humans. That bug-like thing would be the delivery system. You're really just accepting that, Hitomi? Although, I gotta say, that IS a lot of detail for a fake file... It said that humans who had their souls captured become lifeless, right? They gotta be talking about the sick people. The ones who have that disease. Their plan to steal souls is underway in all of Amami City. All the patients suffering from the unknown disease are victims of this chip. I can't even process how someone could even conceive of this plan. I can't believe that Algon Soft is part of all this! That means that they were DEFINITELY in league with the Phantom Society... So then, Paradigm X... Even this model city... They were all to steal people's souls...! A piece of the puzzle's still missing. This Spore thing doesn't seem like something humans could invent or build. Dad said these were being sent here from Algon Soft... Even if we assume that souls are real and harvestable... Why does the Phantom Society want a bunch of souls that badly? That's a question you're never gonna have the answer to. Who said that!? Show yourself! Ha ha ha. So you're finally here. I've been waiting for this moment ever since Azazel assigned me here. I've been going insane in these stagnant days without battle... But my personal hell has finally come to an end. I can quench my thirst for blood by seeing it spurting from such young bodies. Finally, I will revel in the bloodmist again! So, I'm guessing this guy's the creepy factory manager we were warned about. He's only pretending to be human. He reeks of demon. That's no secret. Even I figured that out. If this guy wasn't a demon, he'd be the most psychotic serial killer in history. Now that there's no more need for deception, I'll introduce myself. I am Shemyaza, master of the magical arts. You sound like you knew we were coming. Ha ha ha! Oh, you fool. We didn't just know you were coming here. We know your every move. ...... What!? What are you talking about!? That information won't let you escape death or help you in the afterlife. It'd be pointless to tell you. But, before you die, I must thank you. Knowing this day was coming allowed me to get through all the torturous days before it. Well, if you're going to kill us, what's the harm in telling us? Why are you collecting all these souls, Demon? I'll be sure to etch that question on your gravestone. I told you, you're getting no answers from me, corpse. The time for talk is over. Now I will revel in madness once again! What do we do, Leader? We stalled long enough that I could copy the data we decrypted. Let's get out of here. You guys get out of here. We'll deal with the demon. Thanks and sorry. We'll be at HQ, so make sure you come back safe. A young Summoner and a user of the dark arts...  Yes... This should be enough to indulge my insanity. You two will make a fine appetizer. Eeehahaha! Is this... Death!? Has death finally come upon me!? Heeheehee! I've been waiting for this sweet release... Wh-What's with this guy? He's happy about dying? Now I'm guaranteed the day of judgement. And Azazel and Satanael are still here. They can kill you. ...N-No, wait! There's still a problem! There's still something hindering our plans! Nemissa...! That's right, Nemissa! Wh-What? What are you going on about all of a sudden!? No, I can't accept death yet... I must deal with her... Or Manitou... No... No! I can't die now! Noooooooooooo! ...Why did that crazy demon know Nemissa? He said something about Manitou, as well... I don't know why he knew me! I don't even know who he is! But, maybe... Maybe they know who locked Nemissa up... Well, there's no reason to think about it right now. If we don't do something quick, everyone's gonna lose their souls! Let's go back to HQ. We need to come up with a plan for dealing with everything we learned here. Oh, thank goodness. You two are safe. Perfect timing. The show's about to begin. What're you talking about? We're gonna be the new must- watch show. We're jacking the airwaves. We uploaded the information we got from the factory to the news, and it'll also be broadcast on Paradigm X Air Vision. We'll be able to warn all the citizens of the danger of the Krypto Chip and Phantom's schemes all at once. We'll use their own systems to get everyone to stop using their systems. Hoist by their own petard! Boom! A perfect hack. We get to stay undetected while we accomplish our mission. Y'know what's unbelievable about this, though? It was Yu-Ichi's idea. ...... Ooh, it's starting. It's showtime, everybody! Good evening. Thank you for tuning into the evening news. Huh... Hm? O-Oh, please excuse me for a moment. Hehehehe, here it comes... Ladies and gentlemen, we have breaking news to report. We have just received word that the net police have just identified a group of notorious net terrorists. They released photos of the four suspects to the public. They are as follows. Junnosuke Kitagawa Handle: Lunch WHAT!? What's going on here!? Shingo Sako Handle: Six Yuichi Haga, no known handle. And lastly... No... Everyone's been... These four people make up the hacker group ""Spookies""... And have been charged with tampering with critical system data. Once the authorities determined that they were a threat to public safety, they enlisted the help of Algon Soft, maker of Paradigm X... ...and today their joint efforts have finally led to the identification of the four suspects. Also... What in the hell is going on!? Why are WE net terrorists all of a sudden!? Instead of outing Algon Soft, we got outed! This is completely the opposite of what was supposed to happen! ...Well, we ARE hackers, and hacking is illegal... That's not the issue right now! We hack! They're stealing people's souls! You have 1 new message. Who would be sending mail at a time like this!? OI8ES-WO$KP!L.:4O\SX-2F)=:#K2%/EPFOW-:4%%/F5VW4$G:!7X\4O11-!7QS What the hell, it's not decoded. Just put that into the Spookies communication tool and-- Whoa whoa whoa. Why is that message encrypted like that? The entire group is right here. ...Let's decode it. To: Sakurai From: Kadokura Kadokura? Isn't that that name of Algon Soft's president? Why would Leader be getting mail from the President of Algon Soft? Hello, Sakurai, or should I call you Spooky? I trust you saw the news broadcast. I put it out there in full glory. Congratulations on your crowning achievement. Hackers are one of our greatest threats, as they attack the network so vital to our plans. I sincerely thank you for stepping up and volunteering to act as a decoy to lure them into the open. It's only a matter of time until they're rounded up. When they are, we'll grab a drink together to celebrate. Not just between employer and employee, but as friends, just like we used to... I'll see you later. Wh-What the hell is he talking about!? You...... Six, it's a lie! Somebody... set me up! I'd never sell you guys out! How does he know you, then? ...... So he DOES know you! Yes. It's because I work at Algon Soft. Whaaat? Really? It was only to earn funding and to find out what Algon Soft was doing on the inside. So why'd you keep that secret all this time? You didn't think that was important information? Because I was worried that it'd end up being something like this. You'd all be harboring doubts about me. Besides, I'm not even a real employee of Algon. I just do some contract coding for them. ...Do you think we're dumb enough to fall for that? You too, Yu-Ichi? Think about what you're saying! I AM thinking about it! How come you're the only one of us hackers here who isn't wanted!? Yeah... Now that you mention it... And you're the one who suggested going after the Phantom Society in the first place! You've been working with them ever since the beginning, when you ""got caught"" in the Algon NS building! You've been screwin' with us this whole time... Guys, you gotta believe me! I never sold you out! I'm Spooky! The same guy you've always known! It's a trick! Sure it is. Whatever, man. I'm done with this. Me, too. I'd rather take my chances on my own than stay here with a traitor and wait to get busted! N-No, you can't... ...Goodbye, Spooky. Yu-Ichi... Hitomi, {FF80}. Huh!? You serious, {FF80}? Huh!? You serious, {FF80}? It's {FF81}'s choice, right!? Are you just gonna bail on your friend because of one stupid email? I'm staying with {FF81}. Have fun. Later. Wait, everyone... They can do what they want. {FF81}'s right. ...... Leader did a lot for us. Plus, if he did sell us out, why is he still here? Why wouldn't he have left already? {FF81} still believes in Leader. That's why he stayed. Leader definitely helped out our mission. There's no denying that... ...Thank you. Both of you... Then hurry up and come on. Hold on. I have to talk with {FF81} about something. You guys go on ahead. Heh, whatever. See ya. What are you doing, {FF81}!? Are you really going to let a message from someone you've never met change your mind about your comrade? ...... I was starting to have a better opinion of your friendship. I didn't think it was all that bad. So, why don't you just have a little faith? You're not going to let this supposed betrayal get to you, are you? ...Thank you. Thank you so much... D-Don't get me wrong! I just didn't like the arrogant way that Kadokura punk was talking, that's all. ...You guys go on your own. Is that so? Well, good luck to you. So long. Humans can be so selfish. Relying on people and betraying them on a whim. It's kind of sad... Well, Nemissa only knows one Leader, and that's the one she's seen until now. That's all. And that's enough for you to know that you can believe him? Besides, isn't relying on someone selfish by definition? Nemissa only believes in Nemissa.  And I trust in the Leader that I know. Isn't that enough? ...I believe it's enough. ...Thank you, Hitomi. Cheer up, Leader. Once they're over this misunderstanding, I'm sure they'll all come back. You're right. ...!? Hey, look! Something's on the monitor. What's that? Some kind of bird...? {FF82}... It is I, Kinap... Kinap! {FF82}. He has begun to move. ...There's no time. At this rate, many more souls shall fall prey to him... Hurry. Meet me at the movie theater. Come... The picture's gone... He finally showed up again. This time, I'll get some answers out of him. Let's go. (Uh--! Leader's still here...) (No time to spare, remember!? Plus, he's not not-involved. Let's hurry.) You have no new messages. RE: Dr. Thrill's location We have confirmed his whereabouts. He is performing research at the Primate Intelligence Lab in Nikamimon. We have no plans to interfere with him. And just where are you going at a time like this? Let's go, {FF81}. Algon Microelectronics... Huh. I never thought I'd actually be physically infiltrating this place. All the Algon buildings are huge. Not that I care. Although, how come our HQ isn't something like this, Leader? Hahaha! A hacker owning a high-rise? Yeah... that'd be a change of pace. Hey, I checked it out. The entrance is locked. Shocking, I know. We can't get in without a key card. I'm way ahead of ya. I wouldn't have us come here just to get denied before we even got into the building. Huh? What's that? It's my ace decoder. It can unlock basic electronic locks like this in a snap. You're always there for me, Lunch. Let's get moving. Nothing's more suspicious-looking than a mass of people huddled around a door. All right, let's start by looking for the Krypto Chip production line.  This is a huge place, so even though I hate doing this, we'll need to split up. You've come, Junnosuke... ...Yeah. It's kinda rough out there for me, Dad. Yes, I know, Son... You two listen up, as well. After running into all of you in the factory, I did some more research on the Krypto Chip. I was able to find out where the Spores are being shipped from. Those bizarre things are shipped from the building just east of the Amami Monolith. Next to where that monster is, huh... You'll find an elevator there that leads underground. That's where the Spores are coming from. I'm certain that underground area is connected to the monster on the Monolith... Currently, the roads to Nikamimon are blocked and entry is forbidden... But there is a way. ...... Factory personnel are allowed access to the area. So... I'll rewrite your ID information. Just pretend to be part of Algon Microelectronics. There's a checkpoint on the west end of Shibahama. Show them your ID and they should let you through. I'm sorry, Junnosuke. This is probably all I can do for you. I don't know if this will redeem me in the eyes of you and your mother, but... ...Dad, thanks. {FF80}, Hitomi, get your IDs rewritten. You're the only ones that can make it to that monster. Mister, thank you. Let's go, {FF81}. The brilliance of your soul has faded, and you can no longer stay in this world. But fear not, and return to the place which which your soul came... Your body is gone, and you can no longer return to your world. But do not worry. Certainly, your soul will be allowed into that distant land... Your soul has fallen from the world. Whether this was your fate or not, I shall not say. Go, and set off on your next journey. To the land of souls... You have fallen in the middle of your path, but you gave your all. No one would deride your efforts. Hold your head high as you enter the land of souls, for you belong there as much as anyone... No matter how hard you try, you can no longer regain your soul's former brilliance in this world. Wait until the next time. Now, to the distant land... Your life's luster is gone, but your soul still shines on. May your soul move on to the next land... There is no true life or death, only the shape of the soul. As for your soul, it will leave this world behind and move on to the next... This is unfortunate, {FF82}. But if you wish, I can I see. Then strengthen your demons and Hello. Welcome to the Amami Net terminal. accessed at this time. Unfortunately, you cannot save at this time. Unfortunately, you cannot Install at this time. You have 1 new message. Dear Brother. There's a letter from the Antarctic expedition.  The Antarctice Sea was blue. Very blue.  ??? Well, that's all. Take care!  There are no new messages. Thank you for using this terminal. ...How's it going, Leader? Can you do it? Yeah... I'm in the home stretch. Gotta boot this puppy up and log in to the system... That's a good girl. Now to send the order to begin power transmission, aaaaand... Done. That should send electricity to the plant. It looks like we got to it first, {FF80}. Is the elevator moving, Leader? Gimme a sec. Ummmm... Is this it? Yeah, that's the ticket. All right, I see it. It's on. Phew. It looks like we can move on. I don't know what kind of monster attacked you guys, so let's be extra cautious. GRRR... YOU CHASED ME,  NEMISSA. SO YOU ARE PLANNING  ON DESTROYING US. YOUR EXISTENCE IS A THREAT TO OUR MASTER. I WILL GET RID OF YOU THIS TIME. Threat? How rude! Whether or not Nemissa's a threat to you is all on you. Moowis, how do you know about me? You know who locked me away, don't you? Is your master the one who locked me up? Tell me! HM? WHAT ARE YOU SAYING? YOU DON'T REMEMBER OUR MASTER? Whaddya mean ""our""!? Who's this master? Arrrrgh! Stop dragging this out and tell me everything! Who are you!? How do you know about Nemissa!? HAVE YOU LOST YOUR MEMORY...? WELL, CAN YOU REGAIN IT...? IF YOU DIE, YOU WON'T NEED ANY MORE ANSWERS. SO PERISH, NEMISSA... LET DEATH BE YOUR FINAL ANSWER. ARRR... GHH... EVEN WITH THIS BODY... I STILL CANNOT DESTROY YOU...? I... NEED MORE... I NEED MORE POWER... Nuh-uh, trying to run into cyberspace again? You're not getting away! Let's go, {FF81}! We're chasing down Moowis, {FF81}. This looks like it's another control facility for the factory. Let's see... I think we can turn on Elevator #2 from here. Can we hurry up? ............... Elevator #2 activated. Geez, what a pain. Moowis must really be afraid of us. He really wants to keep us out of here. URRRRGH! GGG...RRR... There's Moowis! NEMISSA... YOU FOLLOWED ME... We have you to thank for that, Moowis. Once you possessed Hitomi, you also gave me the power to enter this world. HMMMMM... YOU REALLY HAVE LOST YOUR MEMORY... I DIDN'T GRANT YOU THAT POWER. WE'RE ALL GIVEN THAT POWER FROM THE START. What...? A-Are you leading me astray? Or am I really from the same group as you!? HMHMHM... HAVE YOU COME TO SEE MY END? YOU DO GOVERN DEATH, AFTER ALL... BUT... I AM NOT ALONE... THE SECOND, OR THE THIRD... WILL... DEFEAT YOU... TH-THEN, MANITOU WILL... MANITOU... WIIIIIIILL... No! M-Moowis! You didn't answer my questions! Moowis! Mooowiiiss! ...I guess entering cyberspace used up all the strength he had left. Arrrrrgh! NO! I finally had a lead! Um, I don't think Moowis knew who locked you away, Nemissa. But... He seemed to know something else... I know that! But, he knew something about me. I could have found out who I am! ...Did you really lose your memory? ...... I-It can't be. I'm me. I've always just been me, right? A-Anyway, let's just get out of here. I don't like it here. We're heading back to the plant. Something doesn't feel right, and this is really ticking me off! There's nothing we can do about it now, Nemissa. I'm sure you'll get another chance to learn about yourself. Anyway, {FF81}, let's get back to everyone else. They're probably wondering how we are. ...Pardon me, Mr. Summoner. Y-You're... You managed to defeat the demon living here. Strong work. You just sat back and watched while we did all the work? I didn't come here to kill demons, so why would I help? I'm here to investigate Phantom. Wherever there are demons, Phantom is always close... At least, that's what I figured. Unfortunately, I came up empty-handed. It seems you didn't quite find what you were looking for, either. That is true, but... Um...  ...You sure keep your cards close to your chest. I'm guessing your situation's complicated. Especially you... I can sense two souls from within you. But one of them... What exactly happened? Eh, nevermind. Getting your life story at this point isn't going to help much. But if you're going to continue fighting against Phantom, I'd advise that you at least meet with someone. Madam Ginko... She's the overseer of all of us in the Kuzunoha clan. Whoa, it's not like we're all friends here yet. Why should we meet her? I'm not forcing you to. But she knows Phantom very well. I'm sure she'd be of help to you. You can find Madam Ginko at the Goumaden. I'll let her know to expect you. Hey, quit deciding for us... Hm? It seems that someone else has arrived. Time for me to be on my way. Just remember, tough battles are won by knowing your opponent first. That's one to grow on. Ciao! Rei... What a mysterious and impressive person. She even knew about Nemissa... Honestly, she's right. I have a feeling that knowing about them will be a significant part of the upcoming battle. Oh good, you two are safe. So, what happened with that demon you were talking about? We killed him... I'm not really happy about it. Killed, huh... Then we don't really have any clues about Phantom, huh... No... We didn't really get anything... I see... Well, at least you guys won't be getting ambushed any more. Everyone's safe, so  that's a success in my book. Let's return to the HQ. I'm a bit worried about Yu-Ichi. Eh, just let him be. I'm sure he'll be smiling again soon enough. You of all people are telling everyone to just leave him alone? He's actually pretty sensitive, you know. Hey, we wanted to stop by somewhere before we head back. Hm? Okay. You can catch up with us later, then. Nemissa, you want to go to the Goumaden? You already suggested it, so I might as well just get it over with. Plus, it's our only clue right now. Hehe. Thanks for going along, Nemissa. All right, {FF81}. Let's head to the Goumaden. What is going...? Something... Something is entering me...? Huh? Wait, wait! Kyahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! ...Who are you? Where am I...? What is going on!? No... No, no, no... Please leave...! What was that...!? Was it Moowis's doing, too? If so... Then let's make him tell us what he was doing! C'mon, {FF81}! Your soul is mixed with the soul of another... You are not worthy of entering this area... You need to play more Soul Hackers before you can enter this area. Until then... Unfortunately, your skills as a Summoner are still lacking. Return once you've played more Soul Hackers. Until then, farewell... Welcome to the Extra Dungeon of Soul Hackers. Let us begin, {FF80}. You may have trouble with this number of allies, but, let's just see how you fare. Good luck. Welcome to the Extra Dungeon of Soul Hackers. Let us begin, {FF80}. Display your strength here. Now go. Who is it that disturbs my slumber? Do you know that you are trifling with Inui, soldier of the Empire? ...Then you will pay for your insolence! Men, prepare for attack! The power of this world is what brings us back from the dead, but our power is our own! Feel our wrath! Inui Platoon... Go! How shameful... We have been defeated again. When will we finally be able to rest...? Mr. {FF81} {FF82}, I presume? Welcome. I have returned from the dead to kill you. Ah, where are my manners. I haven't introduced myself yet. I am Sid Davis. Now, summon your demons. I shall summon the same ones... and then kill you. Lucky whelp... I'll remember this! I don't have any more time to play with you. Goodbye. You have done well to make it through my temple. Excellent work, {FF82}. I do not enjoy battle for the sake of battle, but we have no choice. This is our fate. Now, draw your sword. We will fight fair and square. I am humbled to admit it, but I have been defeated. So long, {FF82}. I will pray for your luck in battle... The world is destroyed, then reborn again with new breath... Humans are the same. Learning life through death, victory through defeat. O, arrogant humans... {FF80}. I will teach you through your own death. Perish by my blade and wait for your rebirth. You possess a fearsome strength. I shall be reborn. Until then, farewell... I am the world. The world exists because I exist. There can be no world without me. ...{FF80}. If you desire to know thyself, then come, face me. ...Your power has extended as high as the skies themselves. You have surpassed me... {FF80}. I shall be watching your growth. So you've come, {FF82}. We've been waiting for you. We know that your power is not to be taken lightly. We will fight you with all our might! Thor, Heimdall, Tyr... To think a human actually defeated the three of you... {FF82}.You are a true warrior, worthy of standing before me. I, Odin, shall do you the honor of claiming your life. Die and become a soldier of Ragnarok, an einherjar! ...Thou art strong. You are too strong to serve under me. Farewell, warrior {FF82}. If you still stand on the day of Ragnarok, we will face off again... This man's soul shines like yours. He too, is a Summoner. His skills are equal, no, perhaps even greater than yours. ...... This is the final battle. Give him everything you've got, {FF80}. Excellent. There is truly no Summoner who could claim to match you now. Do not forget the mindset you have now, mastering and controlling powerful demons. You are a true Summoner. With that, I bid you farewell... appeared suddenly. Hey, Goto? Is that a Devil Summoner from the Heisei era? I believe you are correct, Raido. They use that machine to control demons. They don't use tubes like we do. Heisei Summoners have to rely on machinery? Tch. How pathetic... Raido, let's go. We don't have time to waste here. ...No, I feel like stretching my muscles and testing my skills a bit. sigh Here we go again... Just don't injure him, okay? This era might need him. Hey, Heisei kid. I'm Raido Kuzunoha. I'm a Devil Summoner. This is Goto. We crossed dimensions through the Akarana Corridor. I guess you could say that we're time tourists. As a senior Summoner, I'll give you a bit of training. But before that... Here you go. Take your stance and prepare yourself! Hmm... That machine's not bad. I almost got sent to the scolding room. ...You should jump in too, Raidou. He's got potential. shadows. Enough with the distraction. We're on a case, remember? I agree with Raido. Et tu, Gouto? You need to help train this child. Ugh... Keeping you and Raido separate is always such a pain. Are you sure, Gouto? I'm positive. The country of Japan will undergo major changes after the coming war. Those who grow up in the reformation era of Heisei need to be strong of body and mind. Think of this as training your junior. I see.  ...Then I will hold nothing back, for the sake of the future. Wow. You're as easy to manipulate as ever. Hahaha. Well, let's do this! Whoa! It's Rai-Double Trouble! He is good. If he trains correctly, perhaps be could become... Hey, Raidou, let's use that thing we picked up in the Akarana Corridor. Heh. You certainly are an odd fellow... Though, I must say, that idea has piqued my interest as well... Oh? Have your sails picked up a bit of the Heisei wind? Have you become more modern thinking now? DOUBLE SUMMON! Hahaha! I like you, Heisei Kid. I thought you needed a machine to do everything, but I see that I was wrong. I wanted to train you, but it is I who has learned something new from this experience. I thank you. Modern Summoner of the Heisei Era, remember, no matter what the era, the future of the country is built by the young. We entrust the future of Japan to you and your strength. Wow. Parallel me is so preachy. What do you mean parallel you? You're parallel ME! And that wasn't preachy! That was uplifting and inspirational! That's enough, you two. We still have a case to solve. Ugh... You're so stiff. You need to loosen up some. Why don't we go check out what the Heisei ladies are like. I bet the waitresses here are even better. B-But, I can't abandon my duty... Oh, reallllly? Because it doesn't sound like your heart's in that... Let's get going, Raido. Our joint investigation's taken enough of a detour. So long, Heisei Kid. This was fun. Indeed it was. I will remember you. Now, if you'll just pardon me... bowed. ...Uhhh! Well, that certainly was unexpected. But, now it is really time to say goodbye. Your soul may now return to its proper place. Thank you for playing Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Summoner: Soul Hackers. We at Atlus will continue to create games that we want everyone to enjoy. Please keep expecting great things from us, and we'll do our best to keep you entertained with our efforts. Welcome...

He's the one who pulled Tomoko's soul into this world. But he's... That's not Kinap. That dolphin's just a demon. What are you trying to do to Tomoko?

Why are you two here? Tomoko, get a hold of yourself. This isn't a place you should be in. Let's go home, okay? Go home? Back to that world...? No... No! I'm not going home! Why not? Your mother is worried about you! No, she's only worried about my test scores. She doesn't understand the depth of my suffering. Not like Snappy does. Snappy understands me. I feel so relaxed with Snappy. This isn't good. That demon's totally bewitched her. At this rate, her soul's going to be consumed and she'll never wake up. squeeeeee Don't you see? Little Tomoko's happy this way! squeak Lots and lots of people in this world feel just like her. squeek eek eek And I can gather so many souls! You're not going to get in my way! squeeeeeeeeeeeeeal Not so fast! Nemissa's not gonna let you get away with this! Huh...? Oh, {FF81}, Hitomi...? What's wrong? Thank goodness, you're back to your old self! I... What happened? I was sneaking a quick peek at the VR Art Museum, when... Oh, I need to get back to my homework. If I don't, Mom's going to start nagging me again. Once I've finished my entrance exams, I'll have time to draw all the pictures I want. I'm logging off now. Bye-bye. I was worried for a moment there, but it looks like we did it. But it turned out that this didn't have anything to do with Kinap. I thought we might meet him here... I didn't know demons could do things like that... Plus, what he said about gathering souls bothers me. Either way, we beat him, so it's all good. Let's go home, too. Hey, {FF81}. Let's go see how Tomoko's doing now. defeated. You have one new message. ""Welcome to Paradigm X!"" Let's go, {FF81}. You have 1 new message. Message from ""Reticulian"": We've come up with some new software, so we're contacting you. It's called Steiner, and it expands the fusion functions of the COMP. With this bad boy, you can fuse Spirits, Mitama, and Zoma. So come to EL-115 if you want it. There is no new information on Summoner Net. Yo, my man! I didn't think you'd be able to get both the Knight and Rook pieces. But, a promise is a promise. So, here's the final piece, the Bishop. Hahaha! What's wrong, my man? You here again? Well, 'course you are. Not like you can do anything without that Bishop piece, right? Yup, you've got to be honest. I like you, so I'll give you the Bishop. ...But, you've got to give me a little fee first: your life. You can't trust anybody but yourself. That's the name of this game. Hahaha! Oh-ho, you're an oddball. But I like that about you, my man. Still, you'd be better off if you didn't let your pride get in the way. That's just how the world works. Seeya! Huh? Hey, {FF81}. I can hear a girl's voice. That's Tomoko's voice. It's coming from behind the painting. This is a VR Art Museum, so... Aha! I knew it. We can enter this painting! and Bishop Piece. If that Juggler is telling the truth, then we should be able to save Tomoko now. Let's go back to that Aqua Dolphin painting. placed. Welcome... I shall help you, drifter in this cyber world... What is this place...? Who are you? ...... If you wish, I shall secure this memory in the rifts of the cyber world... What's with this place...? That voice is just repeating itself. Welcome... If you wish, I shall secure this memory in the rifts of the cyber world... Then go... {FF82}. You must not run. You have yet to hear the voice of this soul. Return... I welcome you, {FF82}. If you wish, I can heal your wounded body and remember how you lived. Close your eyes. I pray for your luck.   (SAVE point planned here)   If you wish, I can heal your wounded body. (You cannot be healed yet)  Then farewell...  I pray for your luck.  Oh... Whoops! I've been found! Hm? ...I take it you're not an ally, are you? That face... You're... Rei Reiho, aren't you? You're one of those Kuzunoha, our archenemy... I challenge you! My name is Judah Singh! By my honor, I shall claim your life! Hm... So that means you're... Sorry, but I don't plan on dying today. Why do you stop, Rei!?  Take up your arms! Any more fighting is pointless. ...You cannot defeat me. What are you talking about!? We haven't settled anything yet. Come, Rei! I shall show you the power of the fearless lions of the Singh family! ...Judah, you don't understand what it means to be a Lion of Judah, or even what the Singh name truly means. What!? What are you trying to say!? Power used for the wrong purpose isn't fearless, it's merely thoughtless... You're still young; rethink it. Maybe working for a horrible group like Phantom isn't for you after all... Wait, Rei! ...... I'm wrong? That can't be... ......2F front gate is now unlocked. How foolish... What am I hesitating for...? Letting a Kuzunoha get inside my head. Tch... ...I must complete my mission. All that's left is the basement counter. I should hurry... The door is currently unlocked. This is it... Hmph, it's hiding. Demon! Show yourself! I am Judah Singh! I bear the name of the lion who guards the holy throne! By my honor, I challenge you. ...Announce yourself, Demon. How are you called? I... I am... Winpe... He who is born from the electric sea... Who has called me forth once again... Wh-Who... is the one who breaks the spell... of M-Manitou... Manitou...? Are you talking about the Manitou Net? Ma... Mani...tou... Who... is it... that... calls... Ma...ni...tou... Has it not finished creating a body yet? It looks like it just appeared here. Forgive me, but this is my job. Prepare yourself. ...This was a much tougher battle than I imagined. And it didn't even have a full body yet. What a terrifying demon... But still, this is strange...  It looked like it just appeared... It was incomplete... Why would it cause this...? And the name it kept calling... Manitou... Manitou... Manitou... Manitou... Manitou...... What!? MANITOU... MANITOU... MANITOU... MANITOU... MANITOU...... Tch! It's still alive!? Where!? Where is it hiding!? Wait! It's inside the computer!? MANITOUMANITOUMANITOUMANITOU MANITOUMANITOUMANITOUMANITOUMANITOU MANITOUMANITOUMANITOUMANITOUMANITOU... Dammit! It's trying to blow the place!? Is this it for me...? Is my life going to end here...? What was my life...? What answer did the path I believed in take me to...? No... I cannot die... I have yet to... Man spends his entire life walking his own path, believing that path leads to what he desires... But there are those who become lost. There are those who end their lives while they are still lost. There is one path. But it becomes a different path depending on who walks it. {FF82}, go to the airport. That warrior is still lost, awaiting your arrival. Walk the path of that warrior and find your answer. Now awaken, {FF82}. Arise and go to the airport. {FF81}... {FF81}... C'mon... {FF81}, wake up! Are you okay? Geez, what happened? This is the second time! Second time? What do you mean? Hey, tell us what happened. Did that Kinap guy do something to you? Vision Quest... So you experience other humans' lives through your own soul? So that's how you knew the COMP's password. Still, who is this Kinap character? He knows Nemissa and he can show you the souls of others... I don't understand. He said that a catastrophe was coming to this city, huh? Is he talking about those Phantom guys and their plans for the city? But he said to go to the airport next, right? What's the connection between the airport and Phantom? I'm not sure what they'd have to do with Amami Airport, but that's the only airport I can think of... Oh. Look, there's something new on Summoner Net. Emergency notice to all Society Members. Reports indicate that the demon Winpe has reappeared at Amami Airport. All members gather at the airport immediately. Summoner Finnegan will be the supervisor of this mission. Phantom Society THE DAY IS COMING. Phantom is at the airport, too? So this is the connection to Phantom, huh? Then we're going there, too. If everything goes well, we'll learn about Phantom's plans AND Kinap's plans. The airport is on the north side of Amami Bay. Let's go. Let's go, {FF81}. You have no new messages. Emergency notice to all Society Members. Reports indicate that the demon Winpe has reappeared at Amami Airport. All members gather at the airport immediately. Summoner Finnegan will be the supervisor of this mission. Phantom Society THE DAY IS COMING. This is the Amami Airport Administrative Counter... Heh... All this technology and it's still reliant upon the hand of man... ...1F east gate is now unlocked. All right... Onto the second floor... What a pain... The door is currently unlocked. This is the last one... ...3F gate is now unlocked. Why do I have doubts...? I kill men and demons as ordered, and I live my life in the shadows... Even if I left, what could I do? I only know how to fight. I can't just leave the Society... How absurd. All that would accomplish is that my name would become that of a  traitor... ...All doors within the airport have been unlocked. Heh... This is definitely not the time for me to be lost in thought. I'm a fighter, my answers all lie in battle. My objective is the control room. I hope you're ready for me, Demon... The door is currently unlocked. "
