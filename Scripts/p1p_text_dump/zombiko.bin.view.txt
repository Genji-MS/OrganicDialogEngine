彻 Ԃ ઢ ങ ങ   蛳 Ἔ̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺Hmm, what you're saying sounds pretty
respectable... it just doesn't apply
to me anymore.
  Don't talk like you know everything!
I mean, you're still alive! You can act
that way once you've experienced death!
   Liar! I won't get fooled again!
Am I still pretty? That was all I used
to have going for me...
 Hahaha... Shall I take off my head
in return?
  Aaah, stop it...! If I move around too
much, I'll fall to pieces...
Wh-What're you doing? I thought my heart
was going to stop!
Nooooo!
You do some pretty bold things. That gave
me a good laugh...
   Haha... Who do you think's stronger,
you or me?
It's okay, I'm not mad. I just want you
to become one of us...
 Hey! You're dealing with a demon here...
Can't you be scared even a little!?
   I'll tell you a really scary story...
You're the heroine in it.
And now the fear begins!
  Th-That's not scary at all...
Wh-Why am I shaking? I-It's cold,
that's all...
 That's hilarious! No one knows what
true fear is like!
 How dare you talk that way to someone
who has so much more life experience!?
   A-Aagh... Stop... Stop it...!
  Haha... You really can do a lot!
   I'm not the girl I used to be... I'm not
going to stand by and let you pick on me!
 You're okay with that? Well, I don't
wanna hear you cry about it later.
I like strong men, but I have a pretty
twisted way of showing affection.
   Now hold on... What did I ever do
to you...?
   I've been so mellow lately that I don't
even feel like getting mad at that.
I already know that! You don't have to
say it twice... That's why I always
tried not to stand out!
 When I was still human, I really liked
guys like you.
I was so immature then!
 Well, I'm honored to hear you say so.
  Oh? What is it? Do you wanna play house?
   I might not look like it now, but I
actually liked kids when I was still
a human.
  Are my moves out of date? That kind of
thing worries me...
 Sheesh, you suck! And anyway, if you wore
that getup, the bouncers would stop you
before you could go in.
  Haha... Leave the dancing to me. I used
to dance every day back when... you know.
  So you're pretty much the class clown,
I take it. But actually, I don't mind
your lame jokes so much.
  Your jokes aren't funny at all! Someone
tell this guy how lame they are!
   Well? Are you going to take responsibility
for killing the mood?
   There isn't that much that's fun to do
around here. You really brightened my day!
  Aren't you a little off key?
   Sing all you want! I'll be biting into
your throat in a few seconds!
   Hey! Can you cut it out with that
screeching!?
 I want to go to karaoke again! Ahh...
just once would be enough...
 Just... don't breathe fire or anything
out of the blue, okay...?
   Do it again! I'll figure out the trick
this time for sure!
 So a lot's happened? I heard all about it.
 I already knew that! Don't underestimate
my sources!
   No way! Seriously?
 How do I always get stuck with guys like
this? It really makes me mad!
 Am I... still attractive? I-I'm so
happy...
Will you quit bothering me!?
Just stop already!
Oh wow, you're okay with me? Haha...
I'll think about it.
  D-Don't tell me...! Phew, thank goodness.
I thought my eyeball had fallen out
or something!
You're looking at me like I'm some kind
of monster... Have some self-control!
  I can tell what you're thinking.
But the answer is no! I won't be picked
up that easily!
  Look, I'm not interested in cheap trinkets.
That would have fooled me in the past,
but I've learned my lessons.
No way... Is that... a present? For me!?
   You're interested in me, huh? I guess
you can't judge people by their looks.
   Don't treat me like one of those stupid
demons around here.
Yikes! There's no need to cry over
something like that...
  You're actually cute in your own way.
  Hey, let me have that body! I deserve
it way more than you!
I bet you're going to keep flattering
me before making me look like a fool in
front of everyone... again...
Hey... I bet you want to be like me.
Want me to give you a helping hand...?
No matter what era it is, young people
all tend to think the same way.
 I don't trust words. It takes solid
proof to make me believe something.
   We finally got to meet, and that's all
you have to say?
I don't want to hear that stuff. There's
only one thing I want...
 Why are you telling me this...?
Of all the people to tell that to,
why me?
 I really do get along much better with
humans than demons.
 I feel like I've gone back in time!
So you need me... Is that so? Huh...
   Now, what's the most important step in
negotiation? You know, right...?
   We finally got to meet, and that's all
you have to say?
I can't agree to a request like that.
But you'd better agree to mine!
 I dunno... what are you going to use
my powers for...?
 Ewwww! I can't stand being around you!
 Hahaha... This negotion's going pretty
well, I'd say...
I get asked for more favors by humans
than demons.
 I still have at least half a brain left,
you know... Rotten though it is.
Anyway, I see what you're trying to do.
 You're rather childish. I don't entirely
mind, but...
  What's with you!? Don't make fun of me
just because I'm a zombie!
  Did you just make fun of me!? You know,
I don't think you want to get on my bad
side... You better do what I say.
 You seem really out of it...
   Just because I'm a zombie doesn't mean
you can treat me like that...
   That's your idea of negotiating!?
You're such an idiot!
You're so naive... You'll probably be
like that until you die.
 I didn't know street performers showed
up around here too...
   How dare you perform such a lame trick!?
I want the time I wasted back!
   You are so finished!
   You suck! Get out of my sight!
 What's with you all of a sudden...?
I don't like where this is going.
  What're you trying to say...?
I don't get it at all...
 You're pretty good!
Hahaha...
  Oops, I'm drooling...
  Even after becoming a demon, you tend to
still want things. I'm no exception...
   Are you going to add insult to injury?
 One word to my friends and you'll never
leave here alive! What's it worth to you
for me to stay quiet?
I'd forgotten the excitement I felt as
a girl, but it's coming back to me...
   I might not mind being your servant...
Is there anyone in particular you
want dead?
You're a really bad actor.
 I'd like to go along with your lie,
but I just can't.
  You're pretty cocky.
   You wouldn't want to make me mad, right?
Then agree to my request...
  Are you trying to praise me to death?
I wonder if it'll work...
You have to be scheming something...
   The same bastards who used to pick on
me, begging and pleading for me to spare
their lives...
It's good to be a demon!
Hey... I'm cuter than you, right?
C'mon, give me a straight answer!
You have my spell card, right? I can
smell it on you.
Make me into a Persona with beautiful,
clear skin, okay?
I don't think my personality would be
a good match for a cheerful guy like you.
You're so weak... You'd better shape up
if you want me to keep you company.
Oh my... no way.
   Here, I'll give you this.
  This is for you too!
   I'll give you this... just don't think
badly of me.
Maybe by the time we meet again,
you'll have turned into a zombie!
 I have lots of time, but I don't want
to waste it on something trivial.
I-I'll give you this! Please, just look
the other way this once!
   I think I'm starting to get all cold...
I want to go somewhere else.
   I'll give you this, so hurry on home!
  I can kill you anytime I want... What's
the harm in keeping you alive just a
little longer?
Here's my card. I... I just want to be
beautiful again...
  Oh, I know! I can eat anyone you don't
like for you...
But I can't come along like this...
If I fight you... I'll turn all the way
into a demon.
  Will you accept this? Or do you not want
anything I'd give you...?
 There's still so much I want to do.
So...
  Why go through all the trouble of
fighting? You could just turn your back
on it all and go have fun...
 It's been a while since I last met
a human. Won't you give me something
to remember the occasion?
 What more do you want from me?
 If you want me to talk to you, it's common
sense to bring a present or two!
   What's wrong with living an un-life?
I want to stay alive as much as you do!
   Did you come to make fun of me again?
Well, I've had it! I'm not falling for
it this time! Don't come near me!
 I don't have to be on a diet anymore!
  You should come over to our side!
  You know what I hate? Insincere people!
   You've been taking a lot of things from
demons, right? Share some with me!
   Violence against women is never called
for, okay? I'm sure we can talk this out.
  ඨ, right? You're so famous,
even I know about you. So do you need
something from me?
  You know... I think we can be friends.
Hey, let's talk some more!
Mommy! Mommy! Mommmyyy!
   Do I have to die again? I refuse!
I've had it with dying!
 Something smells nice... Are you wearing
perfume? Wait... are you insinuating
something with that!?
Well, excuse me for being smelly!
I hate people like you, who always look
peaceful and happy!
Share some of that happiness with me!
   I-If you don't mind, I'd like you to
keep me close by.
Wait, let me fix my makeup... I'm really
pretty as long as my makeup's on!
......
So... you had a request for me?
 ......
Ugh, you're so boring! I don't want to
look at you anymore! Go away! And hurry
it up, before I kill you!
   Are you going to get rid of me...?
That's fine... It's got to be better
than looking like this. But...
 I don't know why, but I have a warm
feeling when I'm by your side...
   You wanted something from me, right?
Why not stop bluffing and spit it out?
I'll do anything you want! Just start by
telling me what's going on!
   The reasons why don't matter, I just
want to be useful to you! After all...
you took an interest in me...!
 I get it! This is just a dream!
It's all a dream! It's gotta be!
   I wouldn't normally deal with people
like you.
 To be honest, I've liked you for some
time now! I-I'm not lying!
   Money's the only thing I can believe in...
Give me <Amount> yen.
  I guess I'll take it.
  Ohh... you're poor.
You'll never get to heaven if you keep
that up.
I want a life stone! One will be fine.
 Ahhh... So warm...
 What the--You don't have any!
Sheesh, just my luck. There were other
potential customers around, too...
   The moon isn't always so bright at night,
you know. You better be careful!
 I'll tell you up front: I want a
.
All girls long for gems...
 What's that about!? Ugh, I can't
believe this!
 You're turning down a poor girl's only
wish? That's so awful...!
   Share your living body's warmth with me...
 Ahh... so revitalizing...
  You stingy bastard! Didn't anyone ever
teach you to help out people in trouble!?
   You don't have any!
Ugh! Poor bums like you are out of
the question!
  Well, if that's the attitude you're going
to take, I'll rip you apart!
 Hey! You should've just been honest with
me that you didn't have any!
You really make me mad!
 You're stingier than you look...
Sheesh, just my luck. There were other
potential customers around, too...
...It's okay... I had a feeling you'd
say no anyway...
 I'm just a zombie after all...
It's so cold...
 ......
I'll give you my spell card!
Hey, I'll give you my spell card!
Since I can't eat that much, let the
Persona you make eat it all for me!
