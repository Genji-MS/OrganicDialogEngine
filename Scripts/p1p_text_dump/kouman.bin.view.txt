彻 Ԃ츛ઢ츛ങ츛ച츛  蛳 ἃ̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺Hmm... Your opinion is foolish, but
amusing nonetheless. Consider yourself
lucky.
What? You think I would give my spell
card to the likes of you?
   Hmm... You are an interesting human to
so boldly attempt to sway me to your
side! Do you not value your life?
Ha! Do you truly think I could obey
beings as weak and foolish as humans!?
   Silence! Your words are meaningless!
 Muahaha! You say such asinine things.
I ask of you: what value do you place
on my spell card?
   As I expected! The weaker the being, the
more desperate they are for my help!
I, <Name>, walk amongst you
as a god, wouldn't you agree?
  Muahaha! No feeling is greater than
watching the weak put on such a display!
   Your insolent attitude does little more
than prove your inferiority...
Shall I show you the extent of my power?
 How foolish for a being as low as you to
mock me in such a way!
How low do you place the rank of the
ᄓ?
 I wouldn't bother to concern myself with
a being of your inferior power!
   Urgh... Who are you...? Are you not
afraid of me...?
   Stop. I have no intention of fighting
you...
Now begone, or I cannot guarantee your
survival...
 Hmm... So even those who lack insight
can see my grandeur.
 I see... You want my power? I assume
there is something in it for me, yes?
   Fool! I don't bother dealing with
halfwits such as you!
How ridiculous! You thought I would
accept an invitation such as that!?
If you hope to pacify my rage, your
apology had better be sincere!
  Who are you...? You must not be of
sound mind to invite me so...
   I believe only in myself. That being
said, do you still have business with
me?
   Stop it! Stop it, I say! My ears will
burst if you continue!
Your kind says God gave you the gift
of song, but I say it's a curse!
Stop it! I denounce your voice! You can
be silent now!
   Ugh... It's hard to believe... a being
such as you could emit ultrasonic
soundwaves...
 You... You have a likable voice.
How did you come across it?
 Muahaha! You are truly the inferior
race. Are those twisted warblings the
only sounds you can emit?
  Hm, not bad. Do you know any others?
 Hmm... A sheep has wandered too far
from the flock... Girl, what do you
take me for?
 Hmm... You desire my power?
What do small beings like you even need
such grandiose power for?
   You are a foolish girl who cannot tell
the difference between us! Do not rouse
my fury!
Impudent girl! You cannot simply rely
on my power! Do you understand?
Huaha... It isn't such a bad feeling to
be relied on by a sweet, helpless girl!
What do you wish of me?
 Muahaha! I revel in being relied on by
such a sweet, helpless girl!
Do you desire my power?
 Ha! Using your wiles to reign me in?
How shameful! Only a foolish woman would
resort to such tactics!
  Ha! If you mean those words, I shall
have you as my slave!
   Urgh... What does a lowly human want of
me? This had better not be one of your
ill-conceived traps...
Urgh... Your words are eerie...
Muaha! So even amongst the incompetent
and ignorant humans, there are those
with wisdom.
So, tell me... What aspect of mine
attracted you to me?
It's fine. I will live up to your
expectations. Tell me your desires.
Hmm... Your words are eccentric.
Humans may have some merit after all.
 You speak lies without the slightest
hesitation. Do you mean to mock society?
I am not so blind as to be deceived!
   Rubbish! If you must gossip, do so with
a female demon!
Muahaha! A conversation that lacked any
real value, human girl, but I did enjoy
it.
Huaha... Could you lie like that on
judgement day?
   Huaha... An honest reaction. Fear not,
I won't harm you.
 I know it is difficult to be unafraid
of me, but...
I am mortified to be dreaded like this.
 Ha! Be silent! If you fear me, begone!
 Ha! The weak are only waiting to die.
Are you going to sit there and cry until
you comprehend this!?
   The look of terror on the faces of the
weak and the horrified screams of those
about to die bring me bliss!
Muahahaha! Show me the weight of life.
   Hmm... To show such interest in me...
Are you... female?
 Pitiful being... With my beauty, social
rank, and notoriety, I am in demand
wherever I go.
 Are you such an impertinent fool that
you've forgotten how to ask for things
properly!? Who do you think you are!?
You disgust me! Take back your words!
Insolent wretch! Men do not interest me!
   I know humans use so very little of
their brains, but do try to think for
a moment: I'm a man...
 Human boy... Now would be a good time
to turn back...
  Muahaha! You expected that technique
to spark my interest?
I believe a monkey could have thought
that one up.
 Muahaha! You jest in desperation!
  Ha... Don't strain yourself. I can
already see the punchline, and I'd hate
for you to exert your minisucle brain.
As a high-ranking demon, I don't often
understand the hobbies of my inferiors.
What do you find fun about that...?
 That was utterly senseless! I believe
you've cost me a few brain cells!
If those are your last words, then
I will do you the favor of laughing!
Muahaha! Now give me your head!
  Urgh... What logic... You are not an
ordinary human...
 I wondered what you would do... But I am
no less confused by you humans...
 Muahaha! I have not heard such a vulgar
joke in an eon!
Hmm... What else can you do? Carry on.
   A certain type of rumor, you say?
What do people say of my greatness these
days?
 Hm, melting ice... No doubt a ploy to
gain my favor, but I shall allow it.
 What are you trying to say!? I have no
time for inane chatter!
 How can you speak such carefree words
in these turbulent times!? If you've
time to talk, you've time to fight!
   My greatness has its downside. I am
surrounded by yes men...
It's enjoyable to chat idly with lower
beings like you. Amuse me further.
  The idle banter of inferior beings is
a nice escape. I don't have time to think.
   You thought that would startle me? If
so, you are more foolish than Atlas.
You need to change your perception.
 How childish. Even if you were to
startle me, how would that benefit you?
How absurd! Did you truly think to
startle me? Did you expect me to wince
at your eccentric behavior!?
   Silence! Nothing that an inferior being
could do to me will work!
  Did you do that, knowing I am
<Name>? If so...
  ...Have you gone mad, human?
 Ha... Do you think I have any use for
such a philistine thing?
   Ha... Aimlessly creating things and then
senselessly consuming them... I'd expect
no less from you inferior beings.
You weak, pathetic fool! You dare to
attempt bribery before the very mirror
of nobility!?
  Everything is unnecessary! Instead,
I shall ask for your head. Name your
price.
  Ha... Do you think I have any use for
such a philistine thing!?
But... being that you show respect
toward your betters, I will spare your
life.
   Hmm... a gift, you say? What else do
you have? Something that would suit a
higher being such as myself?
  It is important to have your own
opinions. That is admirable.
  That is your principle? Then answer me
this! Are you contented with killing
demons?
  A fool's expression of foolishness!
Place a priority on thinking before you
open your mouth!
 Don't make me laugh! You would be lucky
to hold a dead man's attention with
such childish preaching!
   You have a strong desire to appease
yourself. Huaha, humans as vigorous as
you are rare.
   Muahahaha! You say such interesting
things. Perhaps you could be groomed
into my successor.
  Huahaha! What a vigorous little human!
You'd make an excellent pet.
Hm... Do you inferior beings have no
sense of fear? What emotions do I stir
in you?
  Child! I am the wrong demon for this
display of arrogance! Now is your only
chance to apologize.
 What are you weaklings saying!? I hope
you die from hitting your head on the
corner of tofu!
   Urgh... What is this pressure I feel?
Who are you? State your name.
  To say such things to me... You are
either a fool, or...
   Hmm... Then I will make you my slave.
Huaha... Sarcasm does not beget the
truth. I am worlds apart from your kind.
   Human, if you are mocking me... death
will come faster than you think!
   Fool! Do you think me unable to see
through your lies!?
Muahahaha! And what if I were to deny
these pleas for mercy?
 Of course. You may continue these acts
of submission.
  What an unsightly gyration. I will
coach you; tell me where you'd like to
improve.
   You were hoping to get my attention with
those bumbling steps? How foolish...
  Urgh! I can't stand to witness this any
longer! Stop, or I shall rip your legs
from underneath you!
  To put it simply, you annoy me!
Be gone from my sight!
 You are clumsy, but I enjoyed it despite
your shortcomings. What kind of reward
are you seeking?
 Muahaha! I didn't know you could train
a monkey to dance like that!
Muahaha! No feeling is greater than
watching the weak put on such a display!
   Your insolent attitude does little more
than prove your inferiority...
Shall I show you the extent of my power?
 I wouldn't bother to concern myself with
a being of your inferior power!
   How foolish for a being as low as you to
mock me in such a way!
You! Just how highly do you think you
rank on the social ladder?
Urgh... Who are you...? Are you not
afraid of me...?
   Stop. I have no intention of fighting
you...
 Hmm... You show promise. The malice
in your glare is as powerful as mine.
That being so, I ask of you! How does
this ruined world look in your eyes?
It troubles me to be stared at in such
a way by a man... You are strange...
Insolent cur! I can't negotiate with
barbarians!
   Avert your eyes, idiot! Your tainted
stare is defiling me!
   Huaha, it is only natural to be
fascinated by me. You have my permission
to look.
  Truly, I am an attractive ᄓ.
Specifically, what has drawn you to me?
 Hmm... Your words are strange, but
I find that interesting...
  You speak lies without the slightest
hesitation... You wouldn't happen to be
mocking me, would you?
  Those who defy me shall burn in the
fires of hell. Are you ready to be
judged?
   Rubbish! If you must gossip, do so with
a female demon!
Muahaha! A conversation that lacked any
real value, human boy, but I did enjoy
it.
 Huaha... Could you lie like that on
judgement day?
   Don't speak so clumsily! It is not my
wish to hurt such beauty!
Did you hope to make me flinch? It seems
beauty and wisdom exist only in female
demons.
Urgh... H-Hmm... Things like that are
but fantasy... They don't happen...
  Hmm... That is interesting. Do you
believe such tales to be true?
Muahaha! Women are such absurd beings
to put stock in such fiction!
Huaha... So what? You bore me; change
the subject.
   Hmm... Your voice is quite beautiful.
I would like to be your partner.
 Hmm... I like your song. Did you write
it yourself?
  You can stop that now! Your voice is not
something to be endured for this long!
Desist! This does not suit my noble
tastes. Sing something that does.
Muahahaha! Your voice is splendid!
 Huahaha, how fitting of you to dedicate
a song to me. What are your wishes?
  Hmm... So this the "motherly love" they
say humans have...
 Hmm... You treat me as a child? How many
eons have passed since you were brought
into this world?
Know your place, girl! Never have I been
so insulted!
  Do you know what you're saying, little
girl!? I am patient, but I will not
tolerate being treated as a child!
Huaha, you are like an angel, naive and
beautiful. Would you like my company?
It's mysteriously soothing... No...
It can't... It can't be...
 Hmm... So even those who lack insight
can see my grandeur.
 Hmm... So you desire my power. My asking
price is your life. Is this acceptable?
 How ridiculous! Do not think I will be
moved by mere words!
How ridiculous! You thought I would
accept an invitation such as that!?
If you hope to pacify my rage, your
apology had better be sincere!
  Muahaha! It is only natural that the
weak turn to me!
  Huaha, you say amusing things, woman.
Invitations should be initiated by men.
Why don't you become my mistress?
It would be for your own good.
  Hmm... Mocking me, I see. You must be
brimming with confidence...
I see. So it is true that inferior
creatures become confused when they
encounter beings of incomparable power.
 Conceited women live short lives!
Shall I prove this truth to you?
   How laughable! Huaha, to think that I
would be taken by a woman's taunting!
Do you understand what you're saying?
If you do, yet you say it anyway...
  Ugh... Do you comprehend who stands
before you?
  A little girl's charm is as valuable
as a chipped life stone. Now, what
should I do...?
  Hmmm... But a human girl... Well, maybe
every so often.
Ha! It is the apex of stupidity to
think I would fall for seduction!
   Fool! I can see through your trickery!
   You wish for my affection that much?
Ah, you've fallen in love with me...?
   It is natural that women are attracted
to me. I am used to it.
 Women shed tears only before men that
they trust. Speak your mind, child.
What's the matter, human girl?
Tears alone won't change anything.
  You inferior beings can't supress your
own emotions! Be silent, or be gone!
Tears should be reserved for times of
sorrow! I see no truth to your story!
  Urgh... The tears of a woman... They are
a trap more often than not...
 Sadness dwells in every heart, but...
tears are not shed for oneself...
I do not care to see your beautiful face
so marred and unsightly. Smile, child.
  Your threats are useless. Find a better
purpose for that face.
 Ha! What a conceited brat! Despite being
the nonsense of inferior beings, it is
too unpleasant to laugh at!
You're trying to threaten me? Do you
know what you're doing, inferior one!?
Your only option is an apology!
  Y-You dare to speak like that to me...?
Have you gone mad?
   You'll pay for speaking to me like
this, you insignificant creature...
 Foolish woman, you have no idea how to
speak properly to me! I'll send you to
hell's magistrate for lessons!
   Conceited women live short lives!
Shall I prove this truth to you?
   Urgh... You say such frightening things
like they were second nature...
Ugh... Do you comprehend who stands
before you?
  Huaha, you have sensibility about you.
You're my type.
 So as a woman of strong will... what
would you think if I were to mock you?
  Hm... I'm surprised you have the gall
to preach to me. Quite a self-assertive
woman...
 A foolish opinion from predictable
humans. But passable nonetheless.
So, what do you expect of me?
  A little girl with no knowledge of the
world dares to preach to ME!? Huahaha!
Do you think yourself some kind of god?
Don't waste your words! Such foolish
advice would bring about a hundred
dangers before a single good!
  Human women are known to talk on and on
about nothing... Huaha, so bt.
  Huaha, if that is the result of what
little brain power you have, I am
impressed.
Perhaps you would make a worthy
successor...
  Imbecilic girl! I shall guide you to
your next life!
 Learn to control your arrogance, girl!
 ...That spirit... Is it real or not...?
Do you fear death?
   You say that to me...? Are you a fool,
or...
   Muahaha! I like the way you speak!
You're good for your age!
 Huaha, I know your plan is to try
and agitate me.
  Hmm... You seem rather comfortable
before a being of my stature.
Very well! I shall see just how much
pressure you can withstand.
   Huaha, do not try to endure it. That
wouldn't be wise for your health.
 I see. You truly wish to see my fury?
Consider the wish granted!
   Hmm! You are brazen to ignore me! But
it will make killing you all the more
satisfying!
  Where are you looking? What are you
saying? Are you not afraid of me...?
 Pitiful... The weak soul has caved in
to fear...
   Hmm... So you're ignoring me... If you
think you are proving your composure,
I am not amused.
  Huahaha, don't strain yourself.
Your face is tense with fear.
Do you truly wish to see my fury?
Consider the wish granted, boy!
  Inferior you may be, but no one gets
away with ignoring me!
  Where are you looking? What are you
saying? Are you not afraid of me...?
 Pitiful... The poor soul has been taken
to another world of fear...
The weaker the dog, the louder the bark.
How fitting. Would you like a bone to
chew on?
  Normally, I would have already sent you
to hell for that. However, on behalf of
your courage, I will forgive you.
  What are you saying to me, insect!?
I will swat you down!
Your threats are not the least bit
frightening! I am more annoyed than
anything!
   Urgh... Are you that confident in your
fighting skills that you would threaten
me like that, child?
  You'll pay for speaking to me like
this, you insignificant creature...
 What good is yelling going to do, you
neanderthal!? It's just plain stupid!
Silence! Die, fool!
  Urgh... A madman...
Your scream... Is it some kind of
enchantment?
   Muahahaha! My power has driven this
human mad!
 Huaha, like a beast in heat! What is
the meaning of your scream?
 Hmm... You are quite skilled with your
hands. You could work in my court.
Not bad, for an inferior. Continue to
practice, and perhaps I'll be amused.
Urgh... To think there are still powers
in this world I don't have...
  Tell me your secret...
   Muahaha! A young, evil spirit would be
highly amused by this!
  Huaha, not bad, coming from such a lowly
being. What else can you do?
Well, I can indulge myself to hear the
vulgar conversations of my inferiors
every once in a while.
 Hmm... So humans are capable of such
speech... Ha... I've learned something.
   I am setting aside my precious time
to listen to you, so a token of
appreciation is only natural.
 So what!? The content was too shallow
to fulfill my intellectual hunger!
   Ha! The more incompetent the human,
the more they talk!
I don't care what the subject is, it is
taxing to listen to my inferiors speak!
If you want me to listen, then...
 If that is what you want to speak of,
find a demon who cares...
Surely there is something to that...
   Muahaha! A well-spoken human! What a
pleasing rarity!
  Muahahaha! Don't use such childish
tactics with a straight face. I can't
stop laughing! Muahahaha!
 You say amusing things for a boring
human! Not bad!
Perhaps it wouldn't be such a bad idea
to show my power to my inferiors...
 Hm... I suppose it's natural for humans,
in all their inferiority, to thirst for
my power.
 I am setting aside my precious time
to listen to you, so a token of
appreciation is only natural.
 YOU want to use my power!? Enough of
your nonsense!
Ha! I'm surprised a lowly being such as
yourself would have the nerve to say
that!
It's in my nature to kill those who
don't know their place!
Are you a fool!? As if I would ever lend
my power to an inferior such as you!
...Although, if you presented me with
something worthy, I might reconsider!
Do not greet me lightly...
 You seek my power? I cannot just bestow
it upon you...
 There must be something to that...
 Huaha, so inferior beings have finally
learned how to negotiate decently...
Huaha, so some humans do understand my
grandeur.
   Muahahaha! Everyone desires my power!
I am beyond compare!
Very well. I'll give you fools a chance.
  Huahaha, are you trying to disturb me?
It's useless!
   Ha, how foolish. I know you are a low-
ranking being, but can you at least try
using your head?
WHAT!? ...There. I got upset. You should
thank me for my consideration.
And when you do, do it with something
other than words!
  How impudent! I could extinguish you in
no more than a second!
 Such attitude! Do you want to feel my
wrath, human weakling!?
  Ha! You underestimate me? If you want
to die, I can assist! If not, the time
to apologize would be now.
   Urgh... Do you not fear my rage?
   You don't know the extent of my terror,
do you? That must be the case...
   Urgh... You weakling...
Muahahaha! To take such an attitude
toward me is the mark of an
extraordinary human!
   Bold, for a human!
Huahaha, I will enjoy crushing you!
Huahaha! No matter your attitude, it's
still just the howl of a loser.
 Huahaha... Do you plan on being chopped
liver for the rest of your life?
Not that it doesn't become you...
 Hmm... I wouldn't invite you to a party,
but it was enjoyable.
 Hmm... So this is how inferior beings
are amused. I must claim a watching fee.
You sit upon the throne of stupidity!
I have no need of you!
   How stale! You call this a performance!?
You are but a tadpole on stage, being
watched by a hungry piranha!
Every moment I spend with you is time
wasted! Compensate, fool!
   What are you doing...? I don't get
humans...
   Urgh... That was quite a performance...
Not bad, human...
  Muahaha! So even humans have strengths.
Hmm... Do you make your living doing
this? If so, you must be starving.
Huahaha, are you that desperate for my
attention?
  I can't say your strategy is very
effective on me, but I can acknowledge
your effort!
  Hmm... You plan to invite me with you?
You show promise, human.
Hmm... So this is how humans invite
others... It's not good enough.
   Ha! I would never fall for such
temptations! Now do you see, fool!?
Even were I about to die, I could resist
any temptations your inferior kind could
offer me!
If it's my power you desire, you must
show me your good faith, fool!
  Wh... Why you... What are you saying...?
   Many demons are attracted to my beauty.
It's natural. But... you're human.
 ...What are you saying...? I believe
what few brain cells you have are
melting...
  Muahaha! That's the kind of attitude
you'll need if you want my attention!
 Muahahaha! Excellent! Your interest in
me is to be expected!
   In this "survival of the fittest" world,
of course you'll need me! Muahaha!
So you're begging for mercy... Is that
the only thing you weaklings can do?
You have an honest quality about you.
It's important to know your strength.
Ha, what a fool! Do your friends at
home call you Captain Obvious?
 Silence, girl! If you value your life,
do not speak another word!
  Quiet! You've ruined my moment of
silence, and for that you shall pay!
Hmm... Such an unassuming attitude...
I like it not...
 ...Is that your true intention?
How suspicious...
  So you subscribe to the doctrine of,"if
you can't beat them, join them"? Huaha,
interesting.
   Muahaha! Well, I AM larger than life.
Don't be so scared.
  With fear comes respect, and I command
both! That is reason.
   You have my spell card. The strongest
ᄓ is at your command.
Consider yourself lucky.
   Hm... Simply parting ways would be dull.
This is wasted on you humans, but I will
give it to you regardless.
  Hmph. Foolish creature.
You thought I would join you and
your ilk!? Fool!
However, times have changed. Demons have
their own circumstances now...
 Muahahaha! You honestly thought I'd
give you my spell card!?
Remember this! <Name>
 only follows the strong!
   Ha... This would suit you. Take this
archaic thing out of my sight.
Then farewell, weak, foolish, useless
son of man!
  This too might be of use to foolish
humans. Do not waste it.
   I have no time for your kind!
  As long as I imagine taking your orders
as some kind of netherworld-inspired
nightmare, I'll be fine...
Very well. I'm ready to protect you.
  Urgh... Fine, take this. Now you have
nothing to complain about.
   Enough! I grow tired of insulting you!
Farewell, foolish human!
Pathetic wretch... Take this and be
gone.
  How can I not see my own reasons for
negotiating with you!?
Why am I unable to read the minds of
such weak and inferior beings!?
  Argh! That's enough! Take my spell card,
and use it however you like!
  Huahaha, siding with you could prove
interesting...
My card will become the Persona that
protects you. It is guaranteed.
   Our meeting was obviously fated.
To fight you would be to betray destiny.
  It would be primitive to simply leave it
at this...
It's not as beautiful or fleeting as the
love letter of a songstress, but it's
yours to keep all the same.
In times like this, you are damned if
you do and damned if you don't.
  Fine... I'll give you my spell card.
If you throw it away, I will unleash a
thousand terrors upon you.
 Hmm... If it isn't one of those inferior
humans.
Ha... You should run home before I kill
you.
   Hmm... If it isn't one of those inferior
humans.
Showing up here despite having such
frail bodies... A strange race indeed.
   Hmm... If it isn't one of those inferior
humans.
Well, you've managed to capture my
interest for now... I'll negotiate.
  Ha! I can take no more of this!
Your very face tries my nerves!
Even a broad-minded demon such as I is
having a hard time justifying how you
exist. Get out of my sight.
So you are my prey! I must say, the moon
tonight is perfect for game hunting!
Consider yourselves lucky to die at my
hands!
   Ha! A fool who stands up to me despite
being weak and inferior!
Before the heavens judge you, I'll give
you a chance! If you want to live...
 You must be confident to answer my
call... And yes, you do look skilled...
But even then, I am <Name>!
I do not know fear!
   Don't mind me. Move along...
...Hm? Be gone already...
Don't mind me. Move along...
...Hm? Be gone already...
You look like you could entertain me.
Why not travel at my side?
 Huaha, the moon is lovely this evening.
Such a night inspires me to dawdle.
I can spare to negotiate with you.
Hmm... a human. Normally you'd be dead
before you laid eyes on me, but...
Luckily, I'm in a good mood.
I'll negotiate with you.
   You must not know your place if you
are the one answering my call.
Still... An inferior being reaching out
for my attention...Wise or foolhardy?
We shall soon see.
Hmph! If it isn't a merry band of
inferior creatures!
What annoying humans... You annoy me
for no real reason!
   Hmph! If it isn't a merry band of
inferior creatures!
I'll buy your worthless lives!
Answer my demands.
 Your aura of battle is strong for a
human. Tell me... Have you dreamed of
fighting the ᄓ?
   Huaha, I feel superb energy from you...
Hmm... Could you actually hold your
ground against me...? It cannot be...
So you answer to my voice... Hmmm...
I see there are many types of inferior
beings...
 Muahaha! Quite a remarkable human, to
answer my call!
But it's unfortunate... If you weren't
so inferior, we could be partners.
ᄔMuahaha! Quite a remarkable human, to
answer my call!
Though you are inferior, you would make
a sufficient henchman. Not bad at all.
 Muahaha! Quite a remarkable human, to
answer my call!
Huaha, you've given me new perspective
on inferior creatures. Thank you.
   ...You have composure, despite my fury?
You do realize, you'll be nothing but
dust if I kill you!
ᄕ   I have no will to fight you...
This can't be! I... I am afraid!?
What have you done to me!?
  ...So you were the source of my
discomfort...
Hmm... For you to put this much pressure
on me...Urgh... How unpleasant.
   Ha! To think it was an inferior human!
Fools who stand up to us, despite their
weakness!
You are lucky to even gaze upon the
ᄓ! Do you understand that?
౿Your existence has led me to speak to
an inferior! How foolish of me! However,
on behalf of the moon, I forgive you.
A negotiation would be pointless, but
I will humor you. Engrave my greatness
into your hearts!
  The moon is at its prime! None can
stand against me! No wall can hinder me!
Foolish inferior! The only value of your
existence is to present gifts to us!
   The aura of battle you exude is superb
and certainly not of a human nature...
Hmm... You're a demon in a human's skin,
aren't you?
ℤ The aura of battle you exude is superb
and certainly not of a human nature...
Hmm... Enough energy to threaten even
me... Perhaps we are rivals...
   The aura of battle you exude is superb
and certainly not of a human nature...
It has been some time since I last
trembled with excitement. Our meeting...
For whom will it be better or worse?
   Hmm... I had fun.
If you have business with me, state it.
I may even listen.
  Enough! Negotiation with inferior beings
is truly meaningless.
You were a fool to anger me! You have
chosen the path of destruction!
  Urgh... The stars must not be aligned if
I am wincing...
   Muahahaha! You are incredibly interesting
for a human!
 Enough! Why have I even involved myself
with a tedious fool like you...?
We have no further need for idle chat!
State your business!
  Urgh... This pressure... You are not a
normal human by any means...
Very well. I'll grant your wish...
Muahaha! You are interesting! A diamond
among the rough stones of lowly humans!
I like you, and that in itself is
deserving of a reward. What do you wish?
Ha... muahaha... ha... I-I can't believe
this... Such insolence...
Insolence... t-toward me... I...
I cannot fathom it!
   You are unfit to be my opponent...
We have no further need to speak.
   Huaha... That power... It's hard to
believe it is born of a human...
Huaha, what a dreadful person you are...
  You have the look of poverty all over
your face. I will not ask for any jewels
of yours...
In my compassion, I shall ask for
ᄖ<Amount> instead.
  Muahaha! Very good, human!
Inferior creatures with neither wisdom
or power kneel before greater beings
such as I. This is the natural order!
  This isn't enough... A zombie would
have higher standards...
   You came into a negotiation without any
money...? How absurd! The poor can die!
Hm, you are either very ignorant or
a deliberate fool to disobey me.
Regardless, you will regret that
decision.
   Hm, you are either very ignorant or
a deliberate fool to disobey me. It's
best I don't involve myself with you.
Hmm... Even meager ones like you should
have a life stone. Present one to me.
  Good, good! You seem to understand my
power! My intelligence! My grandeur!
 You came into this knowing you did not
have one ready for me!? Infidel!
Negotiating without a life stone...
This is beyond foolish; it's pitiful...
Hm, you are either very ignorant or
a deliberate fool to disobey me.
After all, you've managed to anger me
over a stupid rock!
Hm, you are either very ignorant or
a deliberate fool to disobey me. It's
best I don't involve myself with you.
...Ha! I see you have the !
How thoughtful of you to come bearing
gifts! I shall accept it.
  Muahaha! So despite being human, you
understand power.
Quite admirable... Never forget it.
You have one, yet you don't? Hmmmm...
  Can beings as low as you actually
comprehend the value of jewels?
  As if a lesser race like you could
comprehend a jewel's worth! I'll show
you your place!
   I am hesitant to take the filthy life
energy of such lowly creatures. It would
hardly suit my tastes...
But I shall endure your weakness. Now,
give it forth.
 It will undoubtedly taste putrid, but it
will fill the stomach. Let us dine!
   A cretin of a human, wasting my
consideration... You have no reason to
exist!
  Ha... It would be foolish to take your
energy and end up with a stomach ache!
  Fool! I'm exasperated with those who
don't know their place!
Even humans can only be so thoughtless!
  Muahaha! How modest! Such a reply is
fitting of weaklings like you.
How dare you assume such arrogance!?
I don't know what you're trying to
accomplish, but it is angering me!
 Muahahaha! ...Oh, excuse me.
All who stand before me are overcome
with awe and dread... That question was
rather pointless.
   Hmm... So you're willing to risk your
life to claim my spell card.
Life is sacred, but I'm beginning to
like you, human.
  Wha... You're not a...? A life stalker!?
Or a berserker!?
  Fool! Don't make me repeat myself!
 Muahaha! How honest.
   A-Are you taunting me...? Who are you?
 Are you sane? Have you not heard of my
rage? Urgh... This is hard to believe...
If you're going to have to apologize,
you should never have spoken to me in
the first place! Idiot!
You are terribly reckless to attempt to
threaten me. But I like your character.
Hmm... So you plan to make a fool of
me...
Exactly the kind of plan a fool would
dream up!
Hmm... So you'd compare me to a ruby,
the stone of warriors... Huaha, not bad.
 Foolish human! I'll show you the price
a fool pays!
Muahaha! How honest.
   Well, that is to be expected.
  I am <Name>. I'm not a god..
But... you're not very considerate!
I see! Then you shall see the power of
<Name>!
  Then what do you want? Don't get too
cocky, inferior one!
  You are reckless to ignore my call!
...But I like that quality.
Ha... It seems you understand the chain
of power.
  Ha! I never imagined being called a
common demon by your kind!
 Urgh... Do you not fear me?
Ha... Wait. I've changed my mind.
Huahaha...
   Urgh... Do you not fear me?
I can't just let you through here
after all this!
  Ha! Who would believe your empty
promises!?
Huaha... You're trying to test me...?
I never considered that.
 Fool! Utterly inane! You are a cockroach
before a lion! Useless!
   Are you that stupid!? If you want my
rage so much, I'll give it to you!
Your attitude toward me is punishable
by death!
Muahaha! That humiliated state is
fitting of you!
  I see... Then what do you want from me?
I see... Whatever.
 Huaha... I see. Well, whatever.
It seems you are too stupid to
understand the word "no"!
   Muahaha! How honest.
   Ha... It seems you can use your brain.
You're clever, but oh well.
 Don't lie! The heavens would never favor
such a lowborn with that natural gift!
Effort, huh? So in the end, you're just
an ordinary person. You bore me.
   An operation? I hadn't considered that.
I don't comprehend you humans...
   Muahaha! No matter how many songs you
sing, the result is the same!
Stop it, you imbecile! There is nothing
more grating than an unskilled falsetto!
   You... Do you understand your own
actions?
 Muahaha! You are a rare type of youth!
Not bad.
Are you ignorant!? Put on the song, you
buffoon!
   Hmm... Skillful, for a human.
  Precisely! I can acknowledge that.
 That's my name... I'm not asking that.
 Leave it to a human girl to compare me
to a recipe! You walk the path of death!
Hmm... So you are discontent with
reality. It may be interesting to see
your utopia.
   Don't be absurd! I would never use my
power to help your inferior race grow
stronger!
  Haha, don't lie. I can see right through
your shallow plans.
   Muahaha! How honest.
   Hmmm... That expression is quite
charming.
 It seems my precious words were not
heeded... I have no business with
witless girls!
   Huahaha... Master... It has a nice ring
to it.
 A friend? Me, befriend a human girl!?
Never!
   Wh-What are you saying...? You're human,
and I'm a ᄓ...
Muahaha! How honest.
   Hmm... So that last statement was a lie!
I'll purify your sin with my fury!
Ha... Are you hoping to win me over with
inane banter? What a conceited woman.
 I thought as much... You humans would
never bow to me without an ulterior
motive!
  Huahaha, you're a strong girl... Rare,
for a human.
How foolish! You anger me and then
attempt further negotiations!
I can see the stupidity oozing out of
you! Get out of my sight!
  What a fool! Who sets a trap and then
declares that they have done so!?
Muahaha, you intrigue me, girl.
Why expose your own secret?
Urgh... I see... So that's how it is...
A dull answer. I shouldn't have expected
more.
 A dull answer. I shouldn't have expected
more.
 Huaha, it's not every day a girl takes
interest in my name.
Hmm... That answer is all too common.
How boring.
  Ha! Whatever you do, you foolish,
materialistic girl, it is futile!
Hmm, you aren't going to ask for
anything? So there truly are women who
are not so self-absorbed...
I see. Then I will show you what becomes
of foolish girls who disrespect me!
   Hmm... You have potential...
   Hmm... I see.
  Huaha, you don't fear the magistrate
of hell...
Muahahaha! You win! I didn't imagine
you could feign so much ignorance!
Are you saying there are no consequences
of lying to me? Quite brazen, girl!
   Ah, good girl. You're nice and honest.
 *sigh* You can't sense my kindness?
...Foolish girl.
   Huaha, you're like a lost bird with
a charming face.
   Are you being considerate of me? Huaha,
I suppose that human emotions are at
least capable of that.
*sigh* You can't sense my kindness?
...Foolish girl.
   Huahaha, that is a fine gesture.
   Hmm... They say humility is a virtue,
do they not?
 Fool! There is a limit to how much
arrogance I will tolerate!
  So humans do not even comprehend their
own lives... I'll not waste time dealing
with you.
  Don't lie! You haven't an inkling of
feminine charm!
   I am not interested in men...
  Hmm... This is difficult. Huaha, not
even I can differentiate between the
gender of monkeys at a glance.
   ...Then let it be.
 I think a zombie would find you to be
an intelligent partner! I'll make your
union possible!
   You freak! It may be fine for you,
but not with me!
What... What madness is this?
  You finally understand? Well, I am glad
to know you are not beyond salvation.
  Muahahaha! So that is the way of it!
I apologize for troubling you, common
man.
What!? I worry about you, and you take
that attitude!?
 Hwaha! Then I'll send you to hell with
a smile.
Are you that desperate to see me smile?
I didn't know men with such convictions
existed among my inferiors.
Do you not fear death?
 Do you understand that I'm going to end
your insignificant life, and that I will
smile as I do it, you wretch!?
It takes skill to be so nimble.
You'd make a fine addition to my court.
Is that all...? I doubt a crow would
bother to caw...
  The same trick... I suppose I was a
fool to expect anything different...
   Huahaha, I don't even need to ask.
It was to be expected.
  Right? It didn't even need to be asked.
It was to be expected.
 I have no words for uncouth, foolish
humans... I'll turn you all to ashes!
 Ah, how honest.
F-Fool! Don't poke me!
 That is your response...? Then you shall
see this world's cruelty firsthand,
with your own body as a conduit...
Hmm... You're good at kicking balls,
aren't you? I can tell by the way you
talk.
   I am here to talk, not to listen to
your stupid jokes!
 I see... Then it can't be helped.
The heavens punish me for being too
powerful.
So there are still those who seek to
make a trophy of my head! I admire
character like that!
   Are you making sport of my innocence!?
Unforgivable!
   Urgh... What are you planning, human?
  Humanity's downfall will be its
inability to evaluate an opponent!
Your arrogance has crossed the line!
I have no regard for a freak of nature's
thoughts. You'll live your whole life as
a clown, for others' amusement.
  Muahaha! You have the thoughts of a
freak... You'll live your whole life as
a clown, for others' amusement.
I see, just a fool... Then I am not
interested.
Ha... Does the truth upset you?
We have no business.
   Urgh... Are you upset?
 I won't allow you to be as materialistic
as I!
 Then don't say it.
 I see... Then this gift is pure.
   Hmph... How boring.
A weak, disgusting, feeble-minded,
inferior being like you!? 100,000!?
Spare me your lies!
 Huahaha, well thought out, for a human.
Not bad at all!
Hmph... How dull.
  I have no need for it.
 A rag!? Your joke has gone too far!
Huahaha, you have spirit, boy...
   I have no business with cowards.
   Trying to get on my good side, you
temporizing human!? I dislike your kind!
Huaha, how honest.
 Huaha, so courageous humans truly do
exist...
  Are you trying to give me orders,
inferior one? I'll show you the price
of such utter stupidity!
   I thought you might have been strong...
You've betrayed my expectations, fool!
 Huahaha, defiance? Not bad...
  Hmm... Where did your spirit go?
You're boring me now.
 I see... That makes sense.
 So that's why you tried to test me...
Impudent, but I will forgive you.
Your stupidity cannot be cured! It seems
inferior beings are fated to die!
 ...You're up to something, aren't you?
I can tell by how you're acting...
  As long as you understand, weakling.
   Only a fool would ignore a warning
issued by me! Taste my wrath!
   I don't know... I have no interest in
ordinary people.
 You dare to mock my name!? Damn you!
   Hmm... You intend to continue applying
pressure on me...?
  Ahh, how honest.
   Huahaha, I already know that.
You're not even worth enslaving.
 Enslavement is already a high honor for
you, and you are foolish enough to turn
it down!?
  So it wasn't from your heart!? Quite
impudent, inferior one!
   Hmm... Maybe I'm overthinking it...
You assumed I would be unable to see
through your lie!? You'll regret your
stupidity!
  Huahaha! Cry! Tormenting inferior beings
is both a hobby and a prvilege of the
superior!
   Then, die!
 Don't worry, I'm joking. Killing beings
as inferior as you would only disgrace
my good name.
   Huahaha, can monkeys be trained to dance
with grace? Personally, I wouldn't
bother trying.
 What an asinine joke! You can be buried
with that stupid smile on your face!
   ...I can't do that.
Hmmm... You can't understand me...?
Such pitiful, inferior creatures...
How honest of you.
 You dare to mock me, you wretched
creature!? I won't stand for this!
   Ha! You are a disgrace to the art of
dance, you vulgar wretch!
 Something fitting of you... Sadly,
I am lacking in things low and trite.
   Hmmm... It seems you know etiquette.
Not bad at all...
 I see! Then I'll show you the power of
<Name> with my own hands!
Then what do you want? Don't get too
cocky, inferior one.
  Only a daring creature would ignore my
call! How intriguing.
   Muahaha! This difference! I see,
I see. You are of a high rank! I beg
your pardon...
   Hmm? Have you gone mad, inferior one!?
Don't get too arrogant!
 Hmmm... An inferior creature like you
taunting me... How could I be anything
but entertained!?
 Hmm... I see.
  Hmm... I see... You desire me...
   I'm a coward!? I don't care who it is,
none who anger me will be forgiven!
 I see... So you share my opinion...
I see... So you share my opinion...
Perhaps we would get along.
I was a fool to expect something from
one all the more foolish! I have no
business with frolicing fools!
   Then I'll crush your eye sockets!
  As long as you understand. Work hard to
gain sight as pure as my own.
  It's only natural. A common answer.
I am a model of refinement. It is
only natural.
It... It can't be! Such a being exists
in this world who could fail to grasp
my charm...?
  I see... Then I will show you what
becomes of foolish boys who disrespect
me!
  So be it.
  Hmph! A race of liars to this day...
I pray for your expedient extinction...
   Hmm... So you're in a hurry to die...
Eccentric, for a human.
  Then I will be the guide!
  Then mind your manners in my presence.
 Muahaha! My compliments! Not many can
weave such tapestries of lies!
   Ha... Coward.
  Hmmm... So you believe in the occult?
Good, you can worship me.
Well, I figured that.
  Then speak no more! I've wasted enough
time lending my ears to the incessant
babbling of a human girl!
 Hmmm... I am not so feeble-minded that
I would wonder about being regarded as
a wonder.
The fact that humans have yet to die off
is a wonder to me.
Ha! There is nothing I don't know!
 Don't lie, girl! There is no way humans
could have that much skill!
Hmmm... I can't believe this is a song
of inferior beings! Perhaps I should
reevaluate my opinion...
   I see... Either way, I have heard
something I liked... Thank you.
  You don't have enough tremolo! You lack
the heart of enka!
 Hmmm... How colorless.
 Hmmm... A bizzare song. You have a
strange hobby.
  I am the noblest of the ᄓ.
Unfortunately, I am beyond your reach.
  Ugh... Woman...
Hmmm... So you too desire the stone of
light... How common and lackluster.
 You are but a child! Humans are
premature beings!
  Huahaha, don't lie to me. An adult
woman doesn't smell of milk in the way
you do.
  I am asking your age! Can you not
answer such a simple question!?
  Ha... You're a guileless woman...
  Are you trying to find fault with me,
inferior one!? This is getting on my
nerves!
 I never imagined being taunted by a girl
like you...
   Sadly, I can't even mimic your stupidity.
Huaha...
 Hmm... Stay as you are, angel.
 Ha! How inane! If you die, you won't
need my assistance any longer!
Well, it's natural. You shouldn't neglect
life.
Huahaha, you have strange ideas,
haggling the value of your own life.
  Huahaha, how honest of you.
Anyone who regards me in such a way
deserves only death!
   Urgh... T-To imagine I could be
ignored...
 Huahaha, I jest. Don't take it
seriously.
  What a foolish girl! An invitation from
me alone is an honor most high!
Hmph... you deny me that voraciously...
Ha! If you think you are so strong,
I challenge you!
   Hmph. Foolish girl.
Muahaha! Well, I figured that!
 Then I will show you what becomes of
women who defy <Name>!
 Do you want to die? ...No, you're up
to something...
   How delightful it is to see the weak
cower before me! Your screams are my
ultimate bliss!
  ...So you know...
  I have no reason to deal with those who
don't know me.
 Ha! So it was just a girl who doesn't
know her manners!
Hmph... The pebble speaks.
 Ha... The world must be coming to an
end if the rocks are getting angry.
   Silence! I detest women who think that
crying is going to change things!
   Ha! You plan to keep playing the fool?
There're only so many lies you can
stack!
   Muahaha! How honest! Skip the lies
next time.
  Fool! I don't require a foolish woman's
foolish services!
  Huahaha, then I'll teach you the finer
points of my charm.
 Ha... There is nothing I don't know.
   Muahaha! I figured. Not bad...
 It was misfortune that you came into
this world as an inferior being. All you
can do now is endure it.
 Just as light casts shadow, sadness
exists within joy. It's all fate.
  Huaha! Are you saying I'm not enough for
you? You underestimate me!
...Perhaps I was too harsh. I get it,
so stop crying.
  Ha! I knew it! Playing with emotions
doesn't make you a tactician, it makes
you a coward!
  Huaha... That's a first for me.
I see... I apologize. Suspecting
you was an error on my behalf.
That coaxing voice of yours makes it
all the more suspicious...
Muahaha! How honest! Skip the lies
next time.
  Good, good! You are honest.
Only a fool of a girl would disregard
my opinion! You'll regret this!
  Huaha, you have quite a strong will,
girl. I'll let it slide this time.
That would be best.
You defy me, girl...? Urgh, you have
some sort of plan, don't you...?
  Only an ignoramus would ignore my
teachings! You'll pay for that!
  Is that so...? Being that these
are the last words of a deranged man,
I'll turn a blind eye to the offense.
Then I will make you pay for your words!
   ...A wise man doesn't court danger...
But your eyes aren't normal...
   Then I'll show you what becomes of
women who defy <Name>!
   Do you want to die, woman? No...
You're up to something...
 Muahaha, the desperate expressions of
the weak are so enjoyable! The pleas
for one's life are pure bliss!
  ......
 Those offensive words are born of
ignorance. I'll let it go, this time.
So it was just a girl with no manners!
The price for worrying me is steep!
 So your principles change with the tide.
How dull, woman.
  Muahaha! So confident, are you?
A strong woman is to be admired!
   Hmmm... So you still have spirit!
Perhaps your iron will is praiseworthy.
  How elaborate... Hmph. I suppose you may
occupy a corner of my memory.
 Worthless! This, from the same human
that just admonished me!? I take back my
words!
   Hmmm... Awakening... Hm. That is a
difficult question. You've made me
reconsider, inferior girl!
   Fool! Then show me the power of a
goddess!
 Just a little? What do you mean by that?
I don't always understand the idioms
of inferior beings...
Then know your place!
  Hmm... Just as I thought, you're not
so bad! I have an eye for these things!
   I thought perhaps you were a smart,
albeit inferior, woman... But you have
betrayed me in that respect!
Hmm... Where did your spirit go?
You're boring me now.
 Hmm... If you apologize, I'll forgive
you this one time. Be careful not to let
it happen again.
It's too late!
 Urgh... Such resistance... I can tell
you are scheming something...
Huahaha, if you fear death, you don't
stand a chance against me.
   There is meaning in life and death,
you say...? I'd like to discuss this
further with you...
   Your lies are rotten, you inferior
wretch! You should all perish!
  Huaha! It's admirable to see you have
your manners about you.
  You need no encouragement!
 Muahahaha! What an enjoyable manner of
speech! Not bad at all!
 Enough! Your persistance is too much
for even me!
  Hmmm... That's it? You are such a
boorish woman...
 Ha! Spineless fool! I despise women who
falsify their expressions!
 Apologizing already? How stale...
  Urgh... This girl is crazy...
  Being mocked by a girl inferior to me,
I have disgraced the ᄓ.
I must remove this blemish.
 Ha! I don't care who you are or how
high you hold your nose! I'll rip it
off of you!
   ...This woman...
   ...This woman...
   Hmm... So you can express your emotions.
The primates have evolved.
Silence! I'll prevent you from
screaming!
  Fool... That is the life ahead of you.
 It's too late!
 You dare to treat me with such
contempt!? Only death awaits you!
   So there is strength within the inferior
race. Humans may not be completely
worthless after all.
   ......
 Huhahaha!
  I am asking a question! Answer it
immediately!
 Huaha, don't be angry. It's a joke.
You'll take me? ME, <Name>?
Are you truly so foolish?
   I won't deal with you. Don't take it
so seriously.
 It's too late for regrets! The gates of
hell welcome all!
  Your words are futile. Utterly useless.
But don't worry. I'll kill you.
Hmm... That spirit of yours is worthy
of praise. I take back what I said.
  ......
 To lose to an inferior boy's cheap tricks,
I have disgraced the ᄓ.
I must remove the stain!
I see... So you won't reveal your hand.
You're a smart one.
This can't be! It's rather awkward
telling this to someone who's going to
die, but I'll prove it!
  Impossible... You lack the power.
  Muahahaha! I won't die, you say!?
Not bad!
 Insolent fool! I am not to be mimicked
by inferior creatures!
  Urgh... What are you scheming?
 Then before you cast that spell, I'll
simply kill you... Your big mouth was
your end!
  If you want my power, then speak words,
inferior being.
You're telling me to leave...? Even as
a joke, it isn't funny!
 Excuse me! It was a silly question.
After all, an inferior being like you
could never take meaningful action.
  Hmm... Then continue to strive for
perfection.
 Arrogance is unbecoming of you, inferior
wretch! You're 10,000 years too young
to truly negotiate with me!
 Such unfaltering will... I see all the
more potential for you as my
subordinate!
   Hmmm... You say I can't do it?
How interesting.
Ha! You ask for money! I could make it
free if I wanted to!
Urgh... Is that so?
Hmm... That's it? I was a fool for
hoping.
 Huahaha, you are unwilling to comply?
I suppose you should hold onto your
aces while you can...
Ha! Conceited, inferior being! I'll snap
your head instead!
Hmmm... An honest human.
   Huaha, so such spirited humans exist
within the inferior race. Not bad...
  I'm not asking about your circumstances!
Know your place, fool!
I suppose it IS disgraceful to attack
such helpless inferiors...
   Urgh... Are you so confident in your
skills?
   I warned you personally, fool! Pray
you are born smarter in the next life!
 I-It's not a lie! What are you saying,
inferior one...?
You think so!? Well, it's quite natural.
   You want to fight...? Then... if I die,
I'm taking you with me!
Hmmm... A common answer. I expected too
much of you...
 Ha! So you bite the hand that feeds
you! I can't trust you!
Huahaha, you're asking me if I want to
die...? Too funny, human.
   Hmmm... Suspicious.
Hmmm... Suspicious.
You had no reason to hesitate!
You are truly a fool!
   ...I didn't expect a composed answer...
Muahahaha! I was mistaken! You have no
battle aura!
Ha! The ᄓ are nothing to you?
Quite brash for an inferior being!
   Hmm... I guess it can't be helped.
 I'm the inferior being? I take back my
words! It was my mistake!
   Hmmm... You have enough spirit.
You interest me, human...
  Ugh... How imprudent...
What are you saying!? The survival of
the fittest is older than the philosophy
itself! I'll correct your mistake!
  Hmph... The opinions of inferior beings
do not interest me.
As long as you understand now.
 Inferior beings are just that...
inferior! You are born into despair,
and you leave this world the same way!
   Ha! I'll teach you the true meaning
of unhappiness!
...Yes, you seem too human to be
a demon...
Hmmm... If you are so inferior, I see
no reason to remember you.
   Muahahaha! You're no demon! I have
nothing left to fear!
   Muahahaha! You're no demon! I have
nothing left to fear!
