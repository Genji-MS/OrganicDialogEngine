彻 Ԃ ઢ Ҿ ࢹ   蛳 ¦̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺If you're travelin' with me, you better
be ready to cross the gates of hell...
 You want a fist in yer face, punk!?
I don't trust no empty suits like you
who get interested in yakuza!
Hey kid! You got a lot of guts talkin' to
those who walk the bloody path.
  Ha, right, punk... Oh well. I guess yer
more manly than some weak-ass dude with
no spirit.
 You better cut the crap, kid. Or do you
wanna see what hell looks like!?
   I'm being made fun of by a buncha
regular Joes... Maybe it's time to
retire...
 If you're travelin' with me, you better
be ready to cross the gates of hell...
 In our world, we've got duty and
formalities. You can't ignore that!
   I've exchanged cups with the Boss...
I won't hurt a civvy...
   You wanna get decked!? No man sings
before me!
 You're singing... in front of me...
I guess honor is really dead...
That song reminds me of myself in my
younger days. I see the shadow of a
yakuza in you.
If you're travelin' with me, you better
be ready to cross the gates of hell...
 You wanna be a yakuza wife? You can't!
If ya stay happy, you just keep
mindin' the law!
Hahaha, You're crazy to come lookin'
for help from a yakuza, girl!
 Whaddaya think you're doing!? Yakuza
aren't dumb enough to fall for some
broad's con job!
  You tryin' to get on our good side?
You ain't an undercover cop, are ya?
   Hahaha! The gang world doesn't move on
empty compliments.
  You're interesting. In our world, it's
the smooth talkers that make their way
to the top... If they stay alive...
  You better cut the crap, lady! Yakuza
aren't dumb enough to fall for some
broad's con job!
 You tryin' to con a yakuza!? Hahaha!
Damn shame that you're a woman.
   Don't worry. Yakuza don't hurt the
civvies.
Whaddaya gettin' all excited about!?
I don't give you law-abidin' citizens
a second thought!
   Hahaha! Yakuza never bruise a woman's
face.
You sniff too much product? Look real
close, I'm a man.
What're you thinking!? Yakuza don't
drink tea with you nobodies!
   You should get that checked out...
 You better quit with the jokes while
I'm still smilin'.
Heh, funny. Yakuza gotta have a sense
of humor too, ya know.
   You better cut the crap! I've killed
guys for tellin' better jokes than
that!
  SAD DUMMY, APPARENTLY.
 You're funny. Who's your manager? I'll
buy him out.
You wanna talk with a yakuza? Guess
there's some real crazies out there.
   Pipe down a bit, will ya?
  Haha, a yakuza and a civvy talkin' to
each other like old friends! Times
must be good.
 If you're set on followin' the law, you
better quit bein' stupid. Idiots don't
last long out there.
You don't like having all ten fingers?
Or maybe we'll go straight to the dirt
nap.
 I'm being made fun of by a buncha
damn kids... Maybe it's time to
retire...
You're pretty understanding for a
civilian. I don't use my head when I
don't have to.
  Don't mess with a yakuza! Bribes are
against the code!
 Hahaha! In this world, you gotta take
while the takin's good.
  You're quite a looker. When you become
a politican, take care of us, alright?
  Pipe down a bit, will ya?
  Hahaha! You have a big head, and you
talk big too! Too funny, man.
 You've got balls, kid. Maybe you'd be
a good yakuza.
   Hey, you wanna take a peek at hell?
If I don't use my sword once in a while,
the blade'll start cryin'.
I ain't no civvy... If you're from
another gang...
 Kid, one day I'll hand you a cup
personally!
   You must be ready to live in hell if
you're makin' fun of a yakuza, kid!
   Hahaha! All demons who walk the
gangster's path end up like me.
You're pretty good. We could use a
singer or two in our crew.
  What an eyesore. I better swat this fly
with my sword.
 Hahaha! You're still young, kid. Go back
and train s'more.
 Ha, right, punk... Oh well. I guess yer
more manly than some weak-ass dude with
no spirit.
 You better cut the crap, kid. Or do you
wanna see what hell looks like!?
   I'm being made fun of by a buncha
regular Joes... Maybe it's time to
retire...
 You've got your eyes set on a yakuza?
You've got more guts than most punks
out there.
  You're glarin' at a yakuza. You must
want to meet Buddha!
  Hahaha! You're creepin' me out with that
weird stare. Lighten up, kid.
 You're interesting. In our world, it's
the smooth talkers that make their way
to the top... If they stay alive...
  You better cut the crap! Yakuza aren't
patient enough to listen to human BS
all day!
   Hahaha! It's pretty bold to try and con
a yakuza.
  You messin' with a yakuza? Well my gun's
scarier than your BS.
 ...Even us yakuza have weaknesses...
   Hahaha! You really are a civilian lady.
You say some cute things.
  Your singing reminds me of this lady
I knew who ran a bar... I think maybe
I'm in love.
You lookin' for trouble!? We don't let
women sing with that kinda language!
Hey! Nice voice ya got there.
  You're crazy... Look kid, quit takin'
whatever you're on. Your kids'll thank
you for it someday.
   The hell you doing!? To caress a yakuza
is to mock him!
Man, this is something. But I guess it
ain't bad to be treated like a normal
demon sometimes.
  If you're gonna take me to the gates of
hell, you better be able to carry the
burden of my karma...
In our world, we've got duty and
formalities. You can't ignore that!
   Lady, you got a lot of guts talkin' to
those who walk the bloody path.
 You've got a strong heart for a woman.
Maybe you'd make a good yakuza wife.
Think you're ready to see nirvana? I bet
Buddha's pretty lonely.
   Are you made? If you're from some other
gang, then...
  You got as much sex appeal as my left
toe. I'd love to see the suckers that
fall for you.
  Shut up! We don't deal with no law-
abiding women folk!
Hahaha! It's been true throughout the
ages! Women are always attracted to the
scent of evil!
   If I just ignored you, I'd be putting my
rep on the line. Leave it to me.
  This biz ain't a charity. You must not
have done your homework.
...There was a time when they called me
an atrocity... But compared to you...
  You beat me at my own game... You'd
definitely make a good yakuza wife.
You plan on dying soon? I could speed
up the process for ya.
   I ain't no civvy... If you're from
another gang...
 Looks like you've got a deathwish. We
say yakuza don't hurt outsiders, but
that's just our front!
  You ain't a normal woman... Which gang
you from?
   Hahaha! You're pretty confident! I like
that!
  You talkin' about yakuza? Maybe you'll
turn out alright...
 Shut your trap! Nothin' worse than a
yappin' woman!
Hahaha! You're a powerful woman! Fitting
of those manly words!
 An outsider telling off a yakuza?
That's pretty funny.
 You tellin' off a yakuza? Naw, that'd
be impossible...
 Hahaha! No matter what century, women
never cease their meddling.
  A law-abiding citizen and a student on
top of that--you really shouldn't be
hanging out with me. Go on home.
   When you talk, you look the other person
in the eyes. Don't tell me you didn't
know that.
  I'm being coaxed into something by a
girl... Maybe it's time to retire...
  A law-abiding citizen and a student on
top of that--you really shouldn't be
hanging out with me. Go on home.
   When you talk, you look the other person
in the eyes. Don't tell me you didn't
know that!
  You tryin' to be a lone wolf? If I got
bit by a kid, I'd lose respect...
   You beat me at my own game... You're a
pretty capable punk.
You wanna get outta here? I could do
that for ya...
I ain't no civvy... If you're from
another gang...
 You wanna get your ass kicked!?
Shut your trap before I make you scream!
   I told ya kid, drug use is life abuse.
 Hahaha! If you're usin', kid, you oughta
quit and get your ass to a doctor.
Interesting... You've got some real
con-artist potential.
  I can't figure out some civilian
trick... Times sure have changed...
   You're an interesting kid, but if you're
a student, shouldn't you be using your
head?
  You're a smart one. You know how to deal
with us yakuza.
  You wanna negotiate with a yakuza? Lemme
tell ya the first step: hand over
somethin' worth my time.
   I'm the type of guy who enjoys a moment
of silence. Think that over.
   Hey, if you wanna talk, you gotta follow
the rules! First, gimme whatchya got.
What does an outsider want with me...?
I'm runnin' late for a ...meeting...
If you're talkin' to a yakuza, you're
not a real honest human, are ya?
You. Gimme somethin'.
  You've got quite a mouth. Lemme know
when you become a lawyer.
 Hahaha! You're pretty calm for bein'
in front of a yakuza. Show me a token
of your respect.
   You've got guts. You know how to deal
with us yakuza.
 You wanna negotiate with a yakuza? Lemme
tell ya the first step: hand over
somethin' worth my time.
   What the hell are you thinking?
Try using that head of yours.
  You don't think much, do ya kid!? It
ain't wise to make fun of the yakuza!
 What does an outsider want with me...?
I'm runnin' late for a ...meeting...
If you're talkin' to a yakuza, you're
not a real honest human, are ya?
You. Gimme somethin'.
  You've got quite a mouth. Lemme know

 Hahaha! You're pretty calm for bein'
in front of a yakuza. Show me a token
of your respect.
   You got guts, kid. Not too many civvies
out there negotiate with us yakuza like
that.
  You've got balls to stand up to my
anger, kid! I better test ya.
  You makin' fun of me!? Humans die pretty
quickly, y'know!
  You lookin' to die? Well, before ya go,
gimme your stuff.
 What does an outsider want with me...?
I'm runnin' late for a ...meeting...
You makin' fun of me? That's crazy, man.
Lemme test your brain: gimme somethin'.
  If you're a man, you gotta know how to
suppress your anger. I ain't budgin'.
   You're tryin' to piss me off, but you're
outta yer league. It'd be easier if ya
just gave me somethin'.
   You're pretty good. Keep workin' your
way to the top.
  Bustin' out a performance in the middle
of a chat with a yakuza? That's crazy.
I think you better give me somethin'.
  Cut the crap! Yakuza ain't the type to
quit talkin' and watch a show!
  Knock it off, you're wastin' my time.
Just get to the part where ya give me
your valuables.
   You're no good... You've got a problem
or somethin'...
 I don't get what you civvies are
thinkin' these days. Lay it out plain.
   Don't make me laugh so much! I didn't
think it'd be this hard to hold back!
You're a quality peformer, kid. I like
ya. When are you on again?
  Straight up inviting a yakuza? What a
crazy human. Maybe you'll be a big shot
later in life.
   You inviting me? I'll need somethin'
fitting then.
Don't underestimate the yakuza...
We don't take well to bein' treated like
family by the civvies.
  You're sayin' I'm greedy!? You mock me!
...I ain't interested in civvies...
...I ain't interested in civvies...
'Course, goods are another story.
 Real men let go of their greed. I ain't
gonna budge on that, kid.
  Hahaha! Let the yakuza handle your
problems. If you've got somethin' for
me, maybe I'll see things your way.
  Don't be scared. Yakuza don't hurt
outsiders, 'specially not women.
Don't worry. Yakuza are nice guys once
we get what we want.
   Tryin' to get on my good side, girl!?
I can't trust ya!
If you wanna get on my good side, start
by followin' the yakuza tradition.
Maybe you're up to somethin', maybe you
ain't. Either way, I don't trust anyone
I ain't traded cups with.
  In my experience, when people act like
that, you can't trust 'em...
Don't worry, ain't nobody kinder to
women than yakuza. We got big hearts.
  All yakuza are born with natural charm.
You don't need to worry.
   You have proof of our vow. You must
make a Persona with a big heart and
a strong sense of honor.
   Alright, here ya go.
   In the end, you're just a civilian.
You can't understand a yakuza...
   You and I are too different.
   It's a cryin' shame, but I like being
a yakuza. Come back when you've got
more life experience.
Well, I guess you can have this. Put it
toward your training.
  Ciao.
  Hahaha! There's no need for either of
us to hold back.
 Make the call! I wanna get outta here!
 The card is proof of our vow.
Make me a Persona with a big heart
and a strong sense of honor.
  I'll give you this. A pointless scuffle
wouldn't benefit either of us.
 You lawful guys, go home
and play Atlus video games.
I'm going home too.
   Lawful guys should stay home and play
Atlus games. I hear they're awesome.
Put this toward your purchase.
  I'll cut you with my blade! ...Wha!?
It's chipped! Noooooooo! My baby!
 Grrr, screw this! Take my spell card
and beat it!
  ...Unlike you, I can only exist in the
shadows...
But there are times that I wish I could
walk in the sunlight...
 I'll entrust you with the dreams I gave
up on... This is a yakuza's card. Take
care of it...
   We yakuza demons have nothing to gain by
waging war on humans...
   I'll give you this, so maybe next
time... Well... we might be enemies next
time we meet...
 Our hideout got raided by the coppers...
A couple guys got put in the clink...
 Let's negotiate like adults. I think
you'd be happy with my card...
What's a law-abiding human like you
doing out on a moonless night? Answer
me.
Talk about careless... You gotta be
careful on moonless nights. ...Now pay
up. That was good advice.
  Hey! Whaddaya doin' hangin' around a
yakuza!? I'll crush you like a fly!
 What!? No greeting for a yakuza!? You
may be an outsider, but that's an
offense you'll have to pay for!
   Whaddaya want with me...? You kids
should be at home sleeping or
something...
Who are you...? It doesn't matter. I'll
take whatever you got for me, and then
you can be on your way.
Well look at that! You only get to see
a moon like this so many times in your
life.
  Look at that! Swordsmen are their
strongest under a full moon. I think you
oughta pay tribute.
You got guts answering the yakuza
call, but a word of caution: if it's
just for show, Buddha's waitin' for ya!
  If you wanna pass through yakuza turf,
there's a fee!
What's a law-abiding human like you
doing out on a moonless night? Answer
honestly, now.
If you're interested in yakuza, then
you know... you oughta start payin' your
protection dues.
   Hey, I'm <Name>. I figured I
could kill some time talkin' to you
civvies.
You look like you're pretty well-off!
Share the wealth, would ya?
You're not afraid of the yakuza? Any
funny business and you'll end up with a
knife in your back...
  Hey, the greeting is supposed to come
from the inferior to the superior.
Now let's see some good faith!
  Why would you show up to a yakuza
gathering!? You tryin' to stray off the
path of the righteous man?
...You guys are funny, showin' up to a
yakuza gathering. Just pay the entry
fee. I'll let ya off with that.
  Where've you been!? They asked me to
play in the poker gang that the Tendo
gang is hosting... You gotta go for me!
  You're putting a lotta pressure on a
yakuza... So let's turn the tables.
Gimme something.
I like you! We should be brothers! Tell
me what you're after.
  You messin' with me!? I ain't gonna calm
down till I see blood!
What...? You're not scared of the
yakuza...? Of my crime family?
   Hahahaha! This is great! Hahaha!
   It bothers me that you'd dare to
underestimate the yakuza... but
whatever. Whaddaya want?
  To tell ya the truth, I'm glad you're
not my enemy. So tell me what ya want.
   You're the spittin' image of a yakuza!
I'd hand you a cup personally! So, what
can I do ya for?
If you're for real... then you handle
things like a pro!
   You're not quite enough to be one of my
soldiers. You're too young to be messin'
with yakuza.
  You've got balls... Ya don't hear the
civvies talk like that too often...
  Let's see the money. ศ<Amount>.
   Kids today carry around too much money!
But thanks, I'll take it.
  You screwin' with the yakuza!? If you
wanna talk, I hope you've got your
check book ready!
 What're ya spending your money on? If ya
spend too much while you're young,
you'll be sorry later in life.
 You screwin' with the yakuza!? Ya better
start followin' orders, or someone's
gonna get hurt.
  You don't know how the yakuza really
work, do ya? ...Well you'll find out
soon enough.
 Gimme a life stone. One oughta do.
 You civvies don't need stuff like this,
so I'll take it off your hands. Thanks.
You screwin' with the yakuza!? If you
wanna talk, I hope you've got your
life stones ready!
You oughta learn to carry life stones.
They're important if ya wanna seal the
deal.
You screwin' with the yakuza!? Ya better
start followin' orders, or someone's
gonna be sleepin' with the fishies.
  What's a law-abidin' citizen gonna do
with a life stone? Don't tell me you
eat 'em...
  I like gems. I'll take a .
You're an obedient kid. Keep it up,
you'll go far in life.
 Ya don't have it.
  You screwin' with the yakuza!? Ya better
start followin' orders, or someone's
gonna get found in a closet.
 You put that much value on jewels?
Greed'll destroy you, kid.
  Lemme suck some life outta ya. I won't
hurt ya too bad.
I like civilian blood. It ain't dirty.
 You screwin' with the yakuza!? You think
I'm gonna defile ya or sometin'!?
 You got a cold? If I caught whatever
you've got, I'd be in trouble...
  I know a lotta humans don't make good
on their debts. You must have it
rough.
  That's pretty weak stuff. But I guess
building a foundation is important, so
keep at it.
   You got a death wish?
  I don't think you fully understand the
situation here... You're not up to no
good, are ya?
 Then how's about I crush you, just like
the doctor ordered!?
   You're keepin' your cool. I guess I'll
let ya off the hook for havin' guts.
I like kids that are easy to understand.
   You're underestimating me, kid...
  You wanna get whacked!?
That's all you've got? C'mon, put a
little more twist in it.
   You're pretty twisted, kid. Want me to
straighten ya out!?
 You're already bent outta shape for your
age... You'll be just another good-for-
nothing...
C'mon, sissy. Work harder.
 If you think you're bein' cool, think
again! I'm that demon!
   You said it! I think I can trust ya!
You've got balls of steel!
Hmm... You're working a poor man's job,
kid. This world's about money. Remember
that.
  Who're you checkin' out? Me? You ain't
an undercover cop, are ya...?
   You must think you're really somebody,
strollin' right into my workplace!
I should kill you for sport!
 Hahaha! You're gonna go far, kid.
  So there's a man amongst you after all.
You'd be just fine livin' the yakuza
life.
 I ain't gonna let you off the hook with
that kinda attitude! You may never have
the chance to speak again!
 If you're scared, then why'd you answer
in the first place!?
   You're underestimating me, kid...
  You shouldn't talk like such a big shot,
kid. Or do you wanna know how bad it
hurts when ya get stabbed!?
  You're talkin' big for a civilian!
You think you can mess with a yakuza!?
  Of course. It ain't easy to walk the
yakuza path for you law-abiders.
  What're you sayin, kid!? Mess with me,
and you'll be leavin' in a body bag!
You spoke... Hey, you ain't my real
contact! You can go to hell for pullin'
a fast one on a yakuza!
Haha, I got the wrong guy, huh...
  I thought you were dead... This ain't
real...
