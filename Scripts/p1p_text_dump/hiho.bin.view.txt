Only pretty ladies can hee-hit on me,

Ahhhhh! Noooo! I'm scared, hee-ho!
 I-I'm a guy! Stop that, ho!
  Hee-how'd I get so popular, ho?
Hmmm... What to do, ho?
  Hee-ho! Are you that desperate to
hee-have me, ho?
 Oooh! A genius like you comes once in
a decade! I'll raise you myself, ho!
Hee hee ho, Just kidding!
  Yeah right, hee-ho!
Your jokes must be too hee-pro for me,
hee-ho!
   I'm cold, ho...
What the...? What are you doing,
hee-ho!?
Hee hee, ho, ho! Your face is the
funniest, ho!
You'll be a star in no time with me as
your manager, kid-ho! Wanna try out?
  Hee-ho! Hee-humans have their
hee-hardships too, ho.
   I've been thinking, ho. Should I stick
with this, hee-ho? I feel so hee-hollow,
ho.
  You heard the rumors about me, ho?
That I'm cool, or hee-handsome?
Hee-huh? No, ho!? Then hee-humans have
no right to live, ho!
   I see... But that's not it, ho! You need
more passion! This battle of rivals is
destin-hee, ho!
  I've got the scoop, too, ho.
   A moment like this on a bloody day
really heals the hee-heart, ho.
   Hee-ho! Are you that desperate to
hee-have me, ho?
 ......! What was that, ho?
   That scared me, hee-ho!
What the!? What was that, ho!? That was
rude! Hee-ho!
Wow... Th-That was surprising, ho...
   Gehhh! What is that, ho? A new kind of
performance?
  Umm... Is this over-the-counter, ho?
   A demon's greed is hee-horrible, ho!
So give me more!
It's not nice to trick an honest demon,
ho! I've been hee-had, you crook!
  Don't you have anything better, hee-ho?
  You're a life saver, ho! I was coming
up short this month, ho.
 Hmmm, it's time for me to have my own
sponsor, hee-ho. Hee ho...!
Hee, I don't understand what you're
saying at all! Ho well!
Are you really that old, ho? If you are,
you're really reliable for your age!
Hee-ho!
Don't underestimate me, ho! I can tell

 You're annoying! Hooooo!
 Waaaaaaah! I'm scared, ho!
 You're not supposed to pick on little
kids, hee-ho...
Hmmm... Well, I'll forgive you this
time, ho.
  I'll teach you the proper way to greet,
ho!
  Tsk tsk, ho! True men need no words!
You talk too much, hee hee ho ho!
You don't get it, ho. I'm a perfect
example. I don't speak much at all, ho!
That's how it should be, hee-ho!
   Hey, ho! I'm a nice, middle-aged gentle-
demon with graying hair, here, ho!
  Hee-ho! It's embarrassing to get so much
praise, ho...
 You're smart, hee-huh?
   Alright, ho! If you get a bloody nose
from watching my sexy dance, it's not
my fault, Hee-ho!
  You're good, ho! Teach me, ho!
   You've got to put your body into it, ho!
Go practice some more, ho!
What's up with that wiggle, ho? The
restroom is that way, hee-ho. You better
hee-hop to it, ho!
  Ooh, beautiful! My blood hee-flows with
a dancer's passion, ho!
I'll dance with you, ho! Let's dance
until dawn, hee-ho!
 You sound confident now, ho, but I'm
packing a super punch! ...Just kidding!
Hee-hee-ho!
   So what do you want me to do, hee-ho?
I'm against violence, but self-defense
is hee-okay, right?
 You're annoying! Hooooo!
 Waaaaaaah! I'm scared, ho!
 You're not supposed to pick on little
kids, hee-ho...
Is my makeup running, hee-ho? Wait...
Do I even wear makeup?
   I can feel the passion in your gaze,
hee-ho!
 Yo, yo, brother hee-hommie-ho!
Whaddaya lookin' at?
There ain't nothin' to look back at,
punk! Hee-ho!
   Am I that hee-handsome, ho?
You falling for me, baby?
Hee, I don't understand what you're
saying at all! Ho well!
Are you really that old, ho? If you are,
you're really reliable for your age!
Hee-ho!
Don't underestimate me, ho! I can tell
your story is full of hee-holes!
*sniff* I can smell lies, ho...
You're a suspicious character!
   Hee-hoho! Everyone loves me, ho!
   Putting two and two together, ho...
Are you asking for my power, hee-ho?
Hee-hohohoho! Huh? No, ho?
 That's already been scientifically
proven, ho! You have something against
science, ho!?
I'm scarier than that, ho!
   I think I need to go to the restroom,
ho...
You're a meanie, Miss! Even I'm afraid
of ghosts, ho...
  Heee! Heee! I love scary things, ho!
   From <Name>, the king of hee horror
and terror, comes a super-scary story,
ho! Wanna hee-hear it, ho?
 You're lovely, lady...
 Wanna sing a duet with me, hee-ho?
   Oh, what a nice voice, ho. Next I want
to hee-hear you scream, ho!
 Are you making fun of my hee-horrible
singing, ho!? I'll never forgive you!
  It's all about love, ho... Learn to
love, and you become a better giver!
Hee-ho!
   Oooooooh, so fascinating, hee-ho...
  What's that, hee-ho?
   Hee-ho... Do I really look that young,
ho?
   What? You're a hee-hundred years too
young to take that tone with me, ho!
  Such bad manners, ho! You should visit
a finishing school, baby.
 Oh Mama! Ho...! I can't believe I did
that, ho...
  Weeee, this is fun!
  Hee, I don't understand what you're
saying at all! Ho well!
Are you really that old, ho? If you are,
you're really reliable for your age!
Hee-ho!
Don't underestimate me, ho! I can tell

Hee-hohohoho! Huh? No, ho?
 Well... I'll let you off this time, ho.
You're a girl, right? You must have more
grace, hee-ho!
I'll teach you a proper greeting, ho!
   What? You're a hee-hundred years too
young to take that tone with me, ho!
  Such bad manners, ho! You should visit
a finishing school, baby.
 Argh! Argh! Arrrrgh! Do you minnnnnd!?
That was mean, ho...
D-Dang it... You can't make fun of me
just because you're kinda cute, hee-ho.
Hohoho! I love people like you, ho!
You move fast, lady! I-I'm fine with
some tea maybe... Hee-ho...
 Back off, you hee-harlot! Don't touch
me, ho!
  Then come on over, ho! I'm gonna eat
ya, heeee-ho!
   Huh!? Are you sure, ho? Wh-Wh-What
should I-I-I-I d-d-do!?
 Lady! Give me a hee-hug, ho!
 *sniffle* I cry easy, hee-ho...
Aw, tears are unbecoming of you, ho.
Come, wipe them away, hee-ho.
   Hey-ho! I saw your bottle of eye 
drops, ho!
   I see right through you, hee-ho! That's
cowardly, trying to take advantage of
my kindness, ho!
   I... I didn't do anything, hee-ho...
   Waaaaah! Don't cry, hee-ho!
  You sound confident now, ho, but I'm
packing a super punch! ...Just kidding!
Hee-hee-ho!

   I'm sorry, Miss... Yell at me more!
Hee-ho-hee-ho!
   This is my first time, hee-ho... I think
I'm getting addicted... Ho...
 Hee, I don't understand what you're
saying at all! Ho well!
Are you really that old, ho? If you are,

Hee-ho!
Don't underestimate me, ho! I can tell

 I'm sorry! Waaaaah!
I didn't do anything, ho... Why are
you scolding me, hee-ho?
 You're so cheerful, ho. I'm jealous...
 I'm sorry, Miss... Yell at me more!
Hee-ho-hee-ho!
   Hey hey, ho ho! You've got guts, hee-ho!
   You don't have business with me, hee-ho?
 If you're just gonna ignore me, I'll
say mean things, hee-ho...
Your mom is a hee-horseface! ...I didn't
wanna say it! You made me do it, ho!
 You're ignoring me, ho!? Now you're
in for it, ho!
   What did I do, ho...?
 hee ho ho...
Hey hey, ho ho! You've got guts, hee-ho!
   You don't have business with me, hee-ho?
 If you're just gonna ignore me, I'll
say mean things, hee-ho...
Your mom is a hee-horseface! ...I didn't
wanna say it! You made me do it, ho!
 You're ignoring me, ho!? Now you're
in for it, ho!
   What did I do, ho...?
 hee ho ho...
You sound confident now, ho, but I'm
packing a super punch! ...Just kidding!
Hee-hee-ho!
   So what do you want me to do, hee-ho?
I'm against violence, but self-defense
is hee-okay, right?
 You're annoying! Hooooo!
 Waaaaaaah! I'm scared, ho!
 You're not supposed to pick on little
kids, hee-ho...
That scared me, hee-ho!
What the!? What was that, ho!? That was
rude! Hee-ho!
Wow... Th-That was surprising, ho...
   Gehhh! What is that, ho? A new kind of
performance?
  Hohohoho! I love people like you!
  You're so playful, hee-ho!
   Hee-ho! Are you that desperate to
hee-have me, ho?
 Wow! You're a magician, hee-ho!
  You're a human, yet you can use
magic...? That's no fair, ho...
I'm innocent, hee-ho. Don't delete me
with your magic... Ho...
   Can you make things appear, ho?
I hee-have lots of things I want, ho!
 Can I have your autograph, hee-ho!?
  I feel smarter just listening to you,
ho!
  You're a good talker, hee-ho. I respect
that, ho!
  Do you want me to hee-hear you out,
ho? Then...
   I'll hee-hear you out, hee-ho... But if
you're boring, they'll be your last
words, ho!
 Shut up, ho! I don't wanna listen
anymore!
 I don't need words, ho, prove it with
your attitude! Hee-ho!
  I don't like stories like that, ho...
  Ummm... I don't think this has anything to
do with me, hee-ho...
   What a touching story, ho! That really
brings back the good ol' days...
Sometimes it's nice to talk to young
people like this, ho. Hee-hee.
Hee-ho! I like these kinds of stories!
They're fun!
Are you interested in me, hee-ho?-hmm? HMMM?
   You need my help, ho? You've got an eye
for demons, hee-ho!
I'm fine with lending you my super
dangerous power, but... you get it,
right? Hee-ho?
 If you want my power, come back in 300
years, ho!
  I don't give my precious power to
hee-humans, hee-ho!
  You! Who do you take me for, ho? I am
the great <Name>, ho!
So now that you know, ho, you have to
listen to me! Hee-ho!
   You want my help, ho? But you look like
you'd use my power for evil...
 Err... I'm in a hee-hurry, ho, so...
   You look suspicious... You're up to
something aren't you, hee-ho?
  You want my power? Hee-ho!
 So I'm an important demon in your life,
ho? That makes me hee-happy, ho!
   I'm so popular! I'm glad I was born a
demon, ho!
   You think I'd fall for a taunt like
that, ho? Well, nice try anyway, hee-ho.
   Hmm... So that's what you think of me,
ho! Maybe we would get along, hee-ho...
 I don't care for your mean negotiation
tactics, but... Hm...
Ummm, well... My wallet's feeling a
little thin recently, ho.
   You making fun of me, hee!? You'll pay
for that, ho!
   I don't like you! I hee-ho hate you!
   That's how you show your good faith!?
What a rude hee-human, ho! I'm going
hee-home, ho!
Then again, maybe you could tempt me to
stay if you gave me something, ho!
  Hee-hold on, hee-here, ho... Let's all
calm down... We're brothers, right...?
  Hee-humans aren't supposed to make fun
of demons, ho...
You're not taking me seriously, ho...
If you were, you wouldn't negotiate like
this, hee-ho...
 You must be a twisted person to use
negotiation tactics like that, ho!
...But I don't mind! Hee-ho!
You're rude, but I'm a mature adult,
hee-ho. I'll forgive you.
 Hee-hoooo! Wow! My hee-heart is
pounding, ho! Pick on me some more!
Ah, so you're a rising comedian, ho?
I wanna be a singer myself. Let's give
it our best shot, hee-ho!
  Your timing is still a hee-bit awkward.
You just need more stage experience,
hee-ho!
   You want my critique, ho? My advice
doesn't come cheap, ho.
   That sucked, ho!
   That was hee-horrible, ho! Gimme back
my money!
You're not planning to charge for that
act, are you? You should be the one
paying me, ho!
 Oh, mamma-mia, ho! I'm really in a
pickle here, ho!
Wow! That's the lost ritual of an
ancient magic, ho! ...Or maybe not,
hee-ho...
You can perform like that at a time of
life and death...? I've got respect for
comedy like that, hee-ho!
   Hee-hohoho! Maybe I should go to
school and get a degrhee-ho...
*whistle* Yeah, I want more, ho!
   Huh? Are you sure, ho?
No, no! Never mind that, ho!
   Hmmm... What should I do, hee-ho?
The choices...
   If you want me to come, give me just a
little more! A hee-bit more, ho!
   Um, am I being made fun of ho...?
I won't forgive you for this!
You think I'd betray my fellow demons
for a negotiator as lousy as you, ho?
You're hee-horrendous, ho!
 You've got some nerve asking me to come with
you, human! Ho, I'll wipe the floor with
ya!
  Let's talk this out, hee-ho...
 Huh...? Why-ho? I didn't do anything!
Really, hee-ho!
  Er... Umm... I'm not like that, ho...
It's a shame, but... Ho...
   Hee hee ho ho... Sorry to worry you,
hee-ho...
 Oh... What to do, hee-ho...?
   I think I'm falling under your spell...
Ho...
  Am I that awesome of a demon, hee-ho?
Hee-hmm... I guess I am, ho!
 You don't stand a chance against me!
Hee, hee ho, ho, ho!
 If you understand my greatness...
Then bring on the gifts, ho!
You can't just walk up and start talking
to me, ho!
You're scared of me, yes, ho? Then you
better listen to me before I get
hee-hopping mad, ho!
  I've got a very baaaaaad feeling
about this, ho...
 A-Are you angry, ho? Hee! You're angry,
aren't you!? Please, be hee-honest with
me, ho...
  Well, let's see-ho... How about a
shoulder massage, ho?
Hee-ho! You better beg for mercy before
I get even scarier, ho!
   Hee-ho! So my awesomehood has even
reached the human world, ho!
You have a spell card from my friend,
ho! Take good care of it, hee-ho!
You can hee-have this, ho!
 Hmm, is that ho.
   Sorry, hee-honey, but our tastes just
aren't clicking, ho...
   Hee-ho! You're not at a hee-high enough
level for me, ho!
  I can at least give you this, ho!
  I'm hee-hungry, ho. It's snack time,
hee-ho! Bye!
  This is extra!
 A flower's life is short, ho... That's
why I'm going to enjoy my youth! Hee-ho!
My spell card's all yours, ho!
 I'll give you this, ho! That brings our
negotiations to an end!
Argh, this is boring, ho! I'm so 
borrrrrred, hee-ho!
  I'll give you this, so be on your way
hee-home, now, ho!
   Why are you still here, ho!?
Hee-hogwash, ho!
  I'm not scared of you, ho! I can even
give you my spell card, hee-ho!
  I want to help you, ho! Man, I'm just
too cool for words, ho!
  I was being serious, ho! Here, I'll
prove it!
  I told you! I can't fight you, hee-ho!
 Take this!
 I-I know, ho! I'll give you my spell
card... So no sending me to hee-heaven,
ho-kay?
   Everything is good now, right...?
I don't wanna go to heaven yet, ho...
Hee-huh? A hee-homo sapien, ho? What are
you doing hee-here, ho?
 That sure is a uh... weird outfit,
ho...
   You're the first human I've ever seen,
hee-ho...
So gimme something to remember this
hee-hoccasion by!
   You there! You're in my way, hee-ho!
Are you trying to be, ho?
  I'm feeling kinda blue today, ho...
Any funny business and I'll hee-hit you,
ho!
   You're no hee-help, ho. I need gifts.
So gimme some, hee-ho!
  D-Don't come near me... You'll get
burned, ho...
 Hm!? I sense an evil presence...!
Just kidding, hee-ho. I'm a boring
demon, ain't I? Ho...
 I'm getting a chill down my spine, ho...
Am I unwanted...?
 Oh, could it be!? Are all of you my
fans, ho?
Hee-how do I look from a human's
perspective, ho? I'm cool, right!?
Tuna are red, perch are yellow,
bean jam is sweet, and so am I! Hee-ho!
Great poem, right?
 Hee-hurry up and state your business,
ho! If you don't, I'm hee-hoofing it
hee-home, ho!
I hate it when people aren't clear about
what they want, ho!
  If you give me something, maybe I'll
hear what you have to say, ho!
  If you've got no business with me, can
I go hee-home?
ჭ֯  The stars were unlucky when I was born,
ho... It doesn't matter now though...
 First of all, you need to know I'm
against violence, hee-ho! No violence!
 I've been waiting for this day, hee-ho!
I'd quit being a demon for you!
 I feel like strong chains of fate are
binding us together, ho!
I wish time would just stop right now,
ho...
  I-I'm scared! Waaahh! Heeee! Ahhhh!
 Wah I see the sorrow in the ghosts of
demons behind you! You're so cruel, ho!
 You and I were brothers in a past life,
ho!? Hee-show me the proof!
   I see that you want to be my friend, ho,
but do you think you'd really make the
cut, hee-ho?
I can tell you wanna talk to me, but...
I don't think I have much in common
with you hee-humans, ho!
  What do you want, ho? ...Oh, I see!
You want to present a gift to the great
one known as me, ho!
 I'm scared... What are you gonna do to
me, hee-ho?
ხ  Why does my heart beat so fast when we
talk, hee-ho? I guess it's not a bad
thing, ho...
  Hee e hee hee hee! Punish me, ho!
   Hey-ho! In the end... What exactly are
you trying to say, ho?
  Let's stop this, ho! It's pointless!
Just get outta here, hee-ho!
  I'm scarrrred! You guys are really gonna
do me in, ho...
Ugh... I see... flowers... Am I going to
heaven, hee-ho? N-Noooo!
   Hee-ho! I've never met anyone this fun
before, ho! I'm super hee-ho-happy!
 I'm busy, ho! Make it snappy!
  I detest violence, ho... So let's talk
it out! Tell me what you want, hee-ho.
  You're awesome, hee-ho! I'm feeling
generous today! I'll listen to whatever
you have to say!
   ...Dag nabit, ho! I'm full of these
random emotions, ho! What's going on!?
I'm hee-so frustrated like this, ho!
   I don't have time to babysit you, ho!
  I'm your slave, ho!
I need money... I'd be fine with <Amount>.
Alright, heeeee-ho!
You don't have money! You shouldn't be
such an impulsive spender, ho!
  You're poor, ho... I feel bad for you...
   No! Give me money, ho!
 Pfffft... Maybe I shoulda asked for a
life stone, hee-ho...
Life stone! One more time, hee-ho!
I want a life stone!
How generous of you, ho! Hee-ho!
   You don't have any!? This is getting us
nowhere, ho!
   Er... You don't even have a life stone,
ho? Are you trying to fail?
No! Give me a life stone, ho!
  If you don't have a life stone to
spare... It'll come back to hee-haunt
you, ho!
Hee, I don't even know what I'm saying
anymore, ho...
I want one, daddy! One , hee-ho!
  No way!? Well I'm still glad I asked,
ho!
  Aw, I was looking forward to that, ho!
 You're a mean guy, ho! You should change
your name to "Mr. Meanyface"!
 Pfffft... Maybe I shoulda asked for a
life stone, hee-ho...
I'm hee-hungry, ho... Can I have just
a little? Are you hee-hokay with that?
   Yay, dinner!
   No? If I get any slimmer, I could fall
into bad hee-health habits, ho...
   Cheap, ho!
 I guess that's so, ho! Hee-hohoho!
 Well I'm suffering more, ho... Teenagers
these days...!
Is my nose malfunctioning, ho? No,
that can't be...
Of course, hee-ho! I'm smart, after all!
   Don't assume you can fool me, ho!
I smell suspicion all over you, ho!
  You seem awfully upbeat, ho... But it
might be a trap, so I can't just say
okay yet, ho.
   You seem pretty well off too, hee-ho!
  What!? And here I was being nice,
hee-ho!
  You got scared, didn't you, hee-ho!?
After all, I'm invincible!
You didn't just think of anything,
hee-ho! I'm not so easily duped!
What adventures await me, ho...?
I'm excited!
  Hey! You trying to revolt against me,
ho? Hee-how annoying!
You're getting angry over this, ho?
Hee-ho, you're so one dimensional!
 Hmmm... You're a step ahead of me, ho...
   *sniff* *sniff* You really won't pick
on me anymore, ho?
   Really!? I'm not gonna be picked on
anymore for reals!? Hee hee-ho!
Remember this, ho! My buddies will
avenge me later!
I guess that's so, ho! Hee-hohoho!
 Well I'm suffering more, ho... Teenagers
these days...!.
   Is my nose malfunctioning, ho? No,
that can't be...
Of course, hee-ho! I'm smart, after all!
   Don't assume you can fool me, ho!
I smell suspicion all over you, ho!
  I see! Then, fine, ho!
 I see! ...What? Really?
Oh, a lie! It was all a lie, ho! I'll go
with you, ho! Anywhere you want, hee-ho!
  It has to be, ho! You're a mean one!
   Dang it! I hate you, ho!
   Oh, but don't stop, ho! Er, never mind!
Stop it, ho! Ooooh!
*pant* *pant* Sh-Shoot! I let my guard
down, ho!
   Ahh, I'm trippin' out, ho! What a
hee-ho rush!
 No... Why are you stopping when it feels
so good, hee-ho...? Wait, am I being
picked on?
   Don't stop!
Oooh... I feel my soul being energized,
ho...
  I guess that's so, ho! Hee-hohoho!
 Well I'm suffering more, ho... Teenagers
these days...!.
   Is my nose malfunctioning, ho? No,
that can't be...
Of course, hee-ho! I'm smart, after all!
   Don't assume you can fool me, ho!
I smell suspicion all over you, ho!
  You seem awfully upbeat, ho... But it
might be a trap, so I can't just say
okay yet, ho.
   You seem pretty well off too, hee-ho!
  What!? And here I was being nice,
hee-ho!
  Don't play dumb, ho! I won't forgive
you!
  T-Taking the offensive now? You've got
type A blood, don't you, hee-ho...
  No, I meant it, hee-ho! I-I'm gonna call
you Ma'am from now on!
That was a lie, ho. Just a little test.
You've got a lot to learn, hee-ho!
 Well... Well of course, ho... So please
don't do anything weird...
 Stop pretending, ho! We all know you're
hee-head over hee-heels for me, ho!
Jealousy is ugly, ho!
  You think so too, ho?
  I guess that's so, ho! Hee-hohoho!
 I can come up with something more
interesting, ho! You can't be content
with just that!
Is my nose malfunctioning, ho? No,
that can't be...
Of course, hee-ho! I'm smart, after all!
   Don't assume you can fool me, ho!
I smell suspicion all over you, ho!
  You seem awfully upbeat, ho... But it
might be a trap, so I can't just say
okay yet, ho.
   You seem pretty well off too, hee-ho!
  What!? And here I was being nice,
hee-ho!
  Is that so? If you're against me,
I won't go easy on you, ho!
  That's right, ho! From now on, you
serve me, hee-ho!
   Don't play dumb, ho! I won't forgive
you!
  T-Taking the offensive now? You've got
type A blood, don't you, hee-ho...
  Stop pretending, ho! We all know you're
hee-head over hee-heels for me, ho!
Jealousy is ugly, ho!
  You think so too, ho?
  Huh!? You're okay with just tea, ho!?
I was a fool for hee-hoping... This sucks,
ho!
   What's your plan after we drink our
tea, hee-ho? You wouldn't suddenly...
Oh, I'm so embarrassed! Heeee!
   Hee-how dare you embarrass me like that,
ho!? Grrrr!
   Huh... Um... You're so sweet that
you're dangerous, ho...
  Words won't cut it, ho! I won't let you
off the hee-hook until you introduce me
to your friends, hee-ho!
   What do you mean, "shut up," ho!?
You don't understand my sadness, ho!
 C'mon! Stop making fun of me, hee-ho!
  *sigh* I fall further and further from
grace, ho...
Nope, I can't, ho! I'm meeting someone
later this evening, ho!
 But... I already have an appointment,
hee-ho...
Okay, Daddy-ho! I'll let you hee-handle
it, ho!
You don't understand sarcasm, ho? Oh
man, hee-hee-ho-ho... What do I do now?
   I don't get any of this, ho! Plus,
I feel kinda insulted now, hee-ho!
  Heee-hohohoho! My stomach hurts!
 Huh? That makes me hee-happy, ho...
A-An order...? Ho...? Does that mean
I can leave now, hee-ho?
  Why can't you decide!? It's too good a
deal to pass up, ho! I'm irritated!
 First... Maybe you should do a hee-ho!
Then... we'll fill the world with
zombies! Good plan, ho!?
  You're not happy with me, ho!? That's
pretty conceited for a newcomer!
 Can't you understand, ho? It's just a
pain in the butt, hee-ho.
That's right, hee-ho. Demons don't die,
so we never feel hee-hollow, ho! You're
pretty smart.
  I...! I...! I was serious, ho! And
yet you still...!
   Really? If you say so, ho, I guess...
  Huh, ya figured it out already, ho?
You're a clever hee-ho!
No, no, be more epic about it! Like,
"Thus, man spake his name, and it was
<Name>!"
 Is that so, ho? Then let the battle
begin, hee-ho!
 I'm already nice and shiny, hee-ho.
I don't believe you, hee-ho. That's
boring.
That's boring, ho!
 Huh? What is it? I really wanna know,
hee-ho!
  That's right! All you have to do is
apologize, hee-ho.
I'm ჯ, not some cold-blooded
animal, ho!
   Yeah, ho! Don't you agree?
 Hmmm... You should train more, hee-ho.
You're not very good.
   Are you stupid, ho? Would you mind
dying for me? You suck! Really, ho!
 I don't think you're right in the head,
Mister. You need some help, ho.
Really!? How generous of you, hee-ho!
  Then give me more, ho! Leave everything
you've got with me, ho!
Cheap, cheap cheap! You suck, hee-ho!
  I don't need moral rehabilitation, ho!
Just gimme!
 Thanks, daddy! But I want it now!
 Hee hee-ho! I was just trying to push
my luck, hee-ho!
 Huh? That's not it, ho?
That won't satisfy me at all, ho!
I'll take all you've got! Hee-ho!
I guess that's so, ho! Hee-hohoho!
 Well I'm suffering more, ho... Teenagers
these days...!.
   Is my nose malfunctioning, ho? No,
that can't be...

   You seem pretty well off too, hee-ho!
  What!? And here I was being nice,
hee-ho!
  You got scared, didn't you, hee-ho!?
After all, I'm invincible!
You didn't just think of anything,
hee-ho! I'm not so easily duped!
What adventures await me, ho...?
I'm excited!
  Hey! You trying to revolt against me,
ho? Hee-how annoying!
You're getting angry over this, ho?
Hee-ho, you're so one dimensional!
 Hmmm... You're a step ahead of me, ho...
   *sniff* *sniff* You really won't pick
on me anymore, ho?
   Really!? I'm not gonna be picked on
anymore for reals!? Hee hee-ho!
Remember this, ho! My buddies will
avenge me later!
Here's an example! Your greeting should
be, Master <Name>, I humbly
welcome you here!
   I bothered to tell you, and you repay
me with hee-ho rudeness! Inexcusable,
ho!
You're not being sincere, hee-ho! If
you're gonna lie, at least make it a
believable one, ho!
  As long as you understand, hee-ho!
After all, I'm a middle-aged gentleman!
 Urgh! I-It's true, ho... I-I'm not
lying...
No, there's no reason to be modest.
I respect you, hee-ho...
   aaaat!? ...... What does
"stupid" mean again, ho!
  Wh-Whaaaaat!? That ticks me off, hee-ho!
   This is just like a comic book, hee-ho.
I'm getting excited!
   Geez! That was your chance to win me
over And you blew it! You're boring, ho!
  You're welcome, hee-ho.
Really!? I'm sorry, ho. I'll dance with
you to show you how sorry I am, hee-ho!
No way! We may be demons, but you still
shouldn't underestimate us, hee-ho!
H-Hee-hold on, ho! *huff* *huff* ...I'm
beat, ho...
Why!? I said we'd get no sleep ho!
 Huh, ho? You're not dancing anymore?
Then... I'll take over, hee-ho!
   You got scared, didn't you, hee-ho!?
After all, I'm invincible!
You didn't just think of anything,
hee-ho! I'm not so easily duped!
What adventures await me, ho...?
I'm excited!
  Hey! You trying to revolt against me,
ho? Hee-how annoying!
You're getting angry over this, ho?

on me anymore, ho?
   Really!? I'm not gonna be picked on
anymore for reals!? Hee hee-ho!
Remember this, ho! My buddies will
avenge me later!
That's how it' supposed to be, ho!
I'm not gonna be happy just because you
said that, ho!
  You get it, ho! You and I would make
great partners, hee-ho.
   Oh, it's okay, ho. You don't have to
be embarrassed!
   As long as you get it, I'm okay with
that, hee-ho.
 As long as you get it, I'm okay with
that, hee-ho. But be careful from now
now on, ho.
 I-I'm sorry, ho! D-D-Don't be angry...
 Hee hee, really? ...Wait a second,
you're a guy, ho! Get outta town!
   That was a suspicious denial, hee-ho.
Am I in danger as we speak, ho?
  Denying it makes you even more
suspicious, ho! But you can't, since I'm
a guy, ho.
 I guess that's so, ho! Hee-hohoho!
 Well I'm suffering more, ho... Teenagers
these days...!.
   Is my nose malfunctioning, ho? No,
that can't be...
Of course, hee-ho! I'm smart, after all!

   You seem pretty well off too, hee-ho!
  What!? And here I was being nice,
hee-ho!
  That's right, that's right, ho! You
finally get it, hee-ho!
W-Well, I get it too, but... don't say
it out loud, ho!
Th-That's not true, ho... I'm a demon
too, so... I-I'm scared, ho...
   Hee-hey, ho! That was a joke! Don't
look down on me like that, hee-ho!
 I was joking, ho. I'm not afraid of
anything, hee-ho.
  Heeee! Stop it! Stop it, ho!
   Hee, I've got a good one! An old lady
walks into a shop out the rain and 
says...
...Ho!? You already know this one!?
You're good, hee-ho...
  Awwww! And I thought so hard about it,
too!
Hee, it's a little embarrassing, ho,
but, okay! I'll tell you my best story!
   Pfffft! Hee-ho! I don't want to, ho!
   What an elitist...!
It has to be, ho! You're mean!
 Dang it! I hate you, ho!
   No... Why are you stopping when it feels
so good, hee-ho...? Wait, am I being
picked on?
   Don't stop!
Oooh... I feel my soul being energized,
ho...
  Here I was trying to be an adult,
and you ruined it, ho!
   You think, ho...? I thought I was acting
manly and grown-up... Hee-ho...
   Well, yeah! But sometimes it's good to
return to your childhood, hee-ho.
   Oh, I'm sorry, ho. Did I mispronounce
it...?
   What!? You're going fishing, ho!?
  Oh, excu-se moi, mademoiselle! Hee
hee ho!
 Never mind, ho! I'm not really the
type to play hee-house, ho!
 You're not... My long lost mother, are
you, ho!? Naw, of course not. Hee-ho.
   That was fun, hee-ho!
  I guess that's so, ho! Hee-hohoho!
 Well I'm suffering more, ho... Teenagers
these days...!
Is my nose malfunctioning, ho? No,
that can't be...
Of course, hee-ho! I'm smart, after all!

Isn't it cruel, ho!? Hee-hold me in your
arms while I cry! Just kidding, hee-ho!
   Huh!? You're okay with just tea, ho!?
I was a fool for hee-hoping... This sucks,
ho!
   What's your plan after we drink our
tea, hee-ho? You wouldn't suddenly...
Oh, I'm so embarrassed! Heeee!
   Hee-how dare you embarrass me like that,
ho!? Grrrr!
   Are you stupid, ho? If you wanna die,
go ahead. No one'll stop you, hee-ho.
Hee hee ho. You let your guard down,
didn't you? But now you're hee-here, so
you have to do what I say, hee-ho!
Hee-hold me in your arms, ho! Er...
Gimme something!
 Come on, fall for it, hee-ho!
  Hmmm, I can wait, but gimme something to
kill the time, hee-ho.
   Alright! I'll go later on, ho!
 You're a mean missy! You know how 
I feel, hee-ho!
 I'm not in love with you, ho!
  I... I was just trying to heal the
broken heart of a maiden... But you're
no maiden, hee-ho!
   It seems you're already in hee-high
spirits, ho. I guess I'm not needed...
 See! There's nothing in the world that
I don't know, hee-ho!
   I've been hee-had, ho! But you're not
supposed to be lying in the first
place, ho!
 H-Ho? You were serious...? I'm sorry,
hee-ho...
I'm gonna cry too, ho! Waaaahhh!
   Urp... What a total reversal... Women
are scary, ho...
 No more crying from now on, hee-ho!

   Really!? I'm not gonna be picked on
anymore for reals!? Hee hee-ho!
Remember this, ho! My buddies will
avenge me later!
You're dumber than I thought, lady!
Hee-how disappointing, ho!
 The Phillippines are in the Western
Pacific, ho, and Taiwan is in the South
Seas! Hee-ho, they're very different!
Ho...? When did this become a trivia
game, ho...? Hee-ho well!
  Oh, excu-se moi, mademoiselle! Hee
hee ho!
 You're the one messing around, hee-ho!
I'm totally peeved!
 My good looks make people crazy, hee-ho.
I'm such a devil, ho!
 N-No... There's nothing I can do about
it then, ho...
  I-Is that ho? But I don't mind being
punished if you're the one doing it...
Rarrr! I'm getting angry, ho!
  Ho... Thank goodness, hee-ho...
I guess that's so, ho! Hee-hohoho!
 *sigh* And now you're embarrassed. Such
a simple person... But I guess that's
a good thing, hee-ho...
  Is my nose malfunctioning, ho? No,
that can't be...
Of course, hee-ho! I'm smart, after all!
   Still trying to play dumb, hee-ho!?
Don't assume you can fool me, ho!
I smell suspicion all over you, ho!
  You seem awfully upbeat, ho... But it
might be a trap, so I can't just say
okay yet, ho.
   You seem pretty well off too, hee-ho!
  What!? And here I was being nice,
hee-ho!
  Huh? What's that? I don't get this at
all, hee-ho...
   So that's physics... ho? I can feel
myself getting smarter, hee-ho!
Oh, excu-se moi, mademoiselle! Hee
hee ho!
 You're the one messing around, hee-ho!
I'm totally peeved!
 My good looks make people crazy, hee-ho.

Rarrr! I'm getting angry, ho!
  Ho... Thank goodness, hee-ho...
You smiled! Alright, now I'm hee-
happy, ho!
   What? What? What is it?
So you don't want to decide right now,
hee-ho... That makes-me mad, ho!
Oh! Maybe I'm the only one who can see
the illusion, ho...
Well, if that's the case, whatever, ho!
Oh! Maybe I'm the only one who can see
the illusion, ho...
I must be working too hee-hard, ho...
  Of course it's bad, ho! You're not
supposed to do that, hee-ho!
Singing is bad? What can I do to save
myself then, hee-ho?
 Singing is bad? What can I do to get you
to talk to me then, hee-ho!?
  Lao, oooh ya!
   You talked to me! I'm so hee-happy, ho!
Why? Why? Why?
 So you don't want to decide right now,
hee-ho... That makes me mad, ho!
Oh! Maybe I'm the only one who can see
the illusion, ho...
Well, if that's the case, whatever, ho!
Oh! Maybe I'm the only one who can see
the illusion, ho...

on me anymore, ho? You could be lying...
 Really!? I'm not gonna be picked on
anymore for reals!? Hee hee-ho!
Remember this, ho! My buddies will
avenge me later!
That's right! All you have to do is
apologize, hee-ho.
I'm ჯ, not some cold-blooded animal, ho!
   Yeah, ho! Wouldn't you agree?
  What are you saying, ho!? There's no
need to yell!
 No... It's not your fault, ho...
   You're a super cool guy, Mister!
   Ho? You're done screaming now? I guess
that makes you cooler, hee-ho!
  Ho? C'mon! Keep screaming, ho! This
sucks!
 That was amazing, ho! I haven't seen
such incredible hee-hocus-pocus since
I was born, ho!
 Yeah! Yeah! That's incredible, ho!
 So this is the power of science, hee-ho?
H-Humans are...
   No way... You're going to erase me...?
That's scary, ho...
 Then what are you going to do, ho?
I can't trust you.
  Really? Really really? Yay!
Label it like this! "To: <Name>,"
please!
   Pfft! What the ho! Forget it! I don't
need it anyway, hee-ho!
  You're cool... Kinda like Benkei the
warrior monk... But that doesn't mean
I can't defeat you!
 Treasure...? You mean... like...
buried treasure, ho!? Let me hee-help
you, ho!
Um... Who are you talking about...?
You don't mean me... do you, ho?
   Wow! That was sweetdiculous, ho!
Let's duel, hee-ho!
   Hee hee ho! Well, yeah! After all,
you're up against the mighty me!
You got scared! You're totally yell-ho!
Hee-ho!

Ahhhh! Ho!
 Right? Right? Confidence level up!
 It's <Name>, ho! Remember that!
 Of course! It's tough being a star
sometimes, ho!
  Hmm... This is my private time right
now, hee-ho. Can you hee-hold off on
that for a hee-bit, ho?
  Nooo... Y-You hate me, ho? I'm
shocked...
  You shoulda said so earlier, ho! Not
that I woulda listened, ho!
   Is that ho? But I'm not going hee-home
empty handed, ho! I've gotta get 
something outta this first, hee-ho!
  Yeah, I'll be here, ho! But I've gotta
be home for dinner, okay? Hee-ho!
   Okay! I'll stay here, hee-ho!
  I want to go hee-home, but... ho...
Ho-ho... You're actually afraid of me,
ho.
 Waaaah! I wanna go hee-home, ho!
   Ummm... There is! Give me something,
hee-ho!
  The love story of the passion between
a human and a demon that breaks down the
walls between them begins here, ho!
 Ho, come on now! No reason to be
embarrassed, hee-ho! It's fate!
   Why not? Take me with you, ho!
 You're right... You have your own
reason, hee-ho... Too bad though...
  *huff *huff* I'm tired now...
  Waahhhh! I'm scared!
   Ahhhh! Hee hee-ho! Gyahhhh! Hohoho!
Are-hohohoho! ...It's my laugh, ho!
What!? What's wrong with me, ho!?
  You're so nice and modest, hee-ho!
 Wh-Why...? It's between humans and
demons...
   I don't want that to happen, ho!
   I-It's true!?
  Ho, is that so? I'm kind of surprised
to get an answer-like that, hee-ho...
I'm all excited, hee-ho!
