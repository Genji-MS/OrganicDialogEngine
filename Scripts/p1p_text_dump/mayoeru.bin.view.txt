warmed up!
 Man of flesh...
<Name> wants to hear more.
  Uuuurh! Do not tell stories of the flesh-

It is memory most treasured.
  Uuuuurh! What are you doing!?
<Name> is angry!
  Man of flesh...
Is it fun to surprise <Name>...?
When still alive, <Name> might

Place for soul to stay!
   Uiii! Might be warm to have that...
Will be happy if so.
   What man of flesh says may be right.
Good luck. Here is hoping.
Uuuurgh! Easy to say anything!
How rash when not so strong!

Those with flesh should be.
Man of flesh...
Voice is heard without yelling.
But loud voice is nice.

Man of flesh... No forgiveness.
  Augh... S... So... cold...

   Slander... Those of flesh slander quite
often... <Name> will not.
   Do not be false, being of flesh!
   Augh... S-So cold... P-Painful...

Threats are useless.

Has nothing to lose!
Craving a body of flesh!
 Augh...
Is it fun to threaten <Name>?

run away?
  Uiiii! It feels good to be teased...
<Name> feels awakened...
   Woman of flesh speaks the truth...
Maybe woman of flesh knows where
<Name> must return to...
   What does woman of flesh know of
<Name>!? Uuuurhhh!
Woman of flesh is so impudent!
  Brain of flesh is smart. It also looks
well-pickled and delicious...

Say things like that to flesh children!
 Augh... S-Scared... Sh-Should run...?
  <Name> had a mother once...

be involved with <Name>!
  Uuurh! Not interested in that story.
Interested in warm! Give warmth!
 Augh... Scary... Where is home of

<Name>...
   <Name> is glad to have
