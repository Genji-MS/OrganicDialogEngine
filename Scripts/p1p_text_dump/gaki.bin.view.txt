Gah! You're scared of me...? Well at
least you know your place, human!
 Gah! Then gimme somethin'!
What was that lameass!? You don't mean

What was that, lameass!? Prove it!
I shouldn't be tellin' you this... but
we preta have attitude problems...
  If I'm gettin' this much pressure now,
what's gonna happen to me later...?
 Gyahahaha! Gyahahaha!
It's been a while since I was in a good
mood like this!
  Gyahahaha! Gyahahaha!
Bein' able to call myself a demon is
already the shit!
   Eh...? You already have my spell card...
I'm outta here then...
Let's see... Take this!
You're such a pitiful human...
 I dunno... You seem different from us...
   Wait a sec... Are you weaker than me!?
I can't give my card to a weakling!
 I'll give you this...
  ...Later!
  You're such a cool guy, so take this
too!
  You don't need my card? Then I'm outta
here!
   This is my card! Isn't it the best card
ever!? You owe me big time! Thank me!
  I'll give ya this, so you have to let
me go!
   This is a waste of time! Who taught ya
to negotiate!? A brick wall? 'Cause
this is goin' nowhere! I'm out!
 This is a waste of time! I'll give ya
this, so let's just leave it at that!
I have a single sentence for you that
sums up my thoughts rather well...
What was that, lameass!?
 ...I think I feel better now that I've
said everything I wanted to say...
...But I'll make an exception this time!
Have my spell card, buddy!
 I've made up my mind! I'm comin' along
for the ride! ...Not that I can really
do that...
   ...Oh yeah! Here, take my spell card!
We'll always be together if I become a
Persona!
  I don't wanna fight anymore... I've had
it with all the pain...
Let's see... I'll give you this.
   Oh crap, oh crap... I'll give ya my
spell card! Just lemme go!
 M-My card's amazing... I ain't lyin'...
Gah! I was just thinkin', "I feel like
talkin' to a human!" And you showed up!
 Gah! I'm filled with greed! You'll take
care of that for me, won't ya?
What was that, lameass!? Don't answer
for me, bro! Man, I'm raging pissed!
 What was that, lameass!? If you wanna
calm me down, give me something!
The moon's gone... I don't like it...
  Lemme make myself clear... I ain't that
tasty... alright? So no fighting...
Gyahahaha! Gyahahaha! I'm awesome!
I'm so frickin' happy right now!
Gyahahaha! Gyahahaha!
I wanna play with you, bro! Hurry up
and do somethin'!
   Oh man, humans! I like killin' 'em, but
might as well negotiate first...
  You're a human, right!? When I run into
humans, I always have them give me
somethin'!
Words are better than fightin', so let's
start with a negotiation...
  I thought I felt somethin' catch my
attention... Figured I'd check it out.
I love humans! Let's hurry up and get
this negotiation started!
   I ain't a social demon, but I feel like
negotiating! First... gimme somethin'!
   Who the hell are you?
Crap, I shouldn't talk like that around
real thugs...
   What's with that face? I don't like
your attitude...
  It's an awesome moon! An awesome moon for
an awesome demon!
   You're stupid, aren't you!? I'm gonna
make you give me something... but you're
okay with that, right!?
   Are you a pacifist? Well, let's see how
negotiations turn out...
  A lot of preta are players, and most
players are preta, but bein' a preta
doesn't guarantee you're a player.
  Gah! Humans are interesting! So whaddaya
want?
 What was that, lameass!? I ain't doin'
negotiations like this! I'm pissed!
 Why ya gotta negotiate like that? You're
scarin' me...
 Gyahahaha! Gyahahaha!

  You know, that's kinda... Ah, forget it!
Whaddaya want me to do?
   So... basically... what I'm askin' is...
Wh-Whaddaya want from me?
 You're awesome! You're like, my new BFF!
I'll grant any wish you've got!
   ...You're confusin' the hell outta me!
Aaaaagh! *splat*
You suck at negotiating!
   ...I'm impressed! What's the other
word for that? Ad... Admiralation?

Alright! I like where this is goin'!

of negotiations... You gotta have at
