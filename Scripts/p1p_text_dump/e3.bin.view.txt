▶Principal Ooishi
Honestly, that man... The student must
have had a reason for starting the fight.
▶Principal Ooishi
Teachers must hear all sides before
making a decision...
▶Principal Ooishi
I had the most awful dream.
Ugh, my head...
 ▶Principal Ooishi
Punishing students isn't the only way
to educate them.
  ▶Vice-Principal Hanya
How dare he give me lip that way!
▶Vice-Principal Hanya
I'm not listening to his excuses!
They're only lies, anyway.
▶Vice-Principal Hanya
As punishment, he must clean windows,
write lines, and polish my shoes!
▶Vice-Principal Hanya
Oh, if only it had been real...
▶Vice-Principal Hanya
Hm? No, it's nothing. Don't interfere
with his punishment.
   ▶Vice-Principal Hanya
Hey! Don't interfere with his punishment!
Unless you want to join him?
  ▶Kiichi
To hell with this! Why am I the only
one getting lectured here?
▶Kiichi
It's just as much the student council
president's fault!
▶Kiichi
Is yelling at students without listening
to them a teacher's job or what!?
 ▶Kiichi
Don't talk to me, dammit! Why am I the
only one who has to write lines!?
▶Kiichi
I  will  not  do  ...
   ▶Kiichi
Don't talk to me, dammit! I'm a little
busy here!
▶Kiichi
I  promise  not  to  ...
   ▶Yukino
I can't stand it. That bald bastard's
throwing his weight around again.
   ▶Yukino
That Kiichi's still writing lines?
▶Ayase
Kiichi didn't do anything wrong, either.
I saw it before the school froze...
▶Ayase
He couldn't take any more of that student
council president sitting on his ass...
▶Ayase
So he just gave him, like, a little
warning, is all.
▶Ayase
Hey, doesn't that bald head make you
wanna, like, punch it?
▶Nanjo
Both parties in a quarrel are culpable.
They should both have to write lines.
  ▶Nanjo
Nothing will happen if we remain here.
 ▶Brown
I hate getting attacked with cold logic,
but I wish people wouldn't get so angry.
  ▶Brown
Let's hurry and go somewhere else.
 ▶Elly
A proper adult acting that way is rather
unsightly in itself.
   ▶Elly
Where could the Night Queen have gone?▶Gambling-addicted student
<FirstName>! The room in front of
the library turned into a casino!
▶Gambling-addicted student
I'm so frickin' excited! You should check
it out, too!
   ▶Gambling-addicted student
While you guys were gone, I, uh, blew
the club's whole budget on poker...
▶Gambling-addicted student
Whoever's playing next is one lucky skunk.
The prize bonus must be through the roof!
 ▶Younger girl
Heh... We're done for.
▶Younger girl
We were always going to die someday...
It's just been sped up a bit.
▶Younger girl
Yep... That's all there is to it.
▶Younger girl
I get to go out while I'm still beautiful,
so I thank the Snow Queen for that.
   ▶Younger girl
Heh... A blue room and a blue piano.
▶Younger girl
Blue curtains and a blue carpet...
I wonder what goes on in that room.
▶Younger girl
It's the room just to our left. Heh...
▶Younger girl
Heh... There's a light floating in a
dark room.
▶Younger girl
The light takes me to another world.
It's wonderful...
▶Younger girl
Leave here and turn left at the cross-
roads, then keep going straight.
▶Younger girl
That's how you get there. Heh...
▶Yukino
A casino? Sounds tempting.
▶Yukino
Huh, so if we've been fighting for a
while, the prize might have increased.
   ▶Ayase
I'm hunnnngryyyy! That reminds me,
where did the home ec room go?
▶Ayase
I had ingredients left over after I made
sweets this morning, so I left 'em there.
   ▶Ayase
I'm hunnnngryyyy.
  ▶Nanjo
A casino? You'll go to seed if you get
involved with such things.
  ▶Nanjo
The fool... He brought it on himself.
  ▶Brown
Hey, that sounds like fun.
▶Brown
We should try this casino ourselves!
▶Brown
I wanna just kick back and have fun at
a casino or somewhere for once.
 ▶Elly
That girl by the window... She's been
muttering something for some time...
  ▶Elly
That girl by the window... She's still
muttering to herself...▶Student council president
Whew... that was close.
▶Student council president
See, I got in a fight.
▶Student council president
The Vice-Principal almost caught me,
which would have been bad.
▶Student council president
But I bet he won't find me here.
▶Student council president
You guys really do work hard.
▶Student council president
Leave everything to your ol' student
council president and run along, okay?
  ▶Drama club member
I heard a story about when Ms. Saeko was
in the drama club...
▶Drama club member
They say she fought with her best friend
over who would play the Snow Queen.
▶Drama club member
I forget her last name, but I think her
first name was Tomomi.
▶Drama club member
There were tears in Ms. Saeko's eyes
when she told me about that.
▶Drama club member
It seems like there's a tragic legacy
behind the Snow Queen's mask.
▶Drama club member
Maybe I should write a play about it once
the town's back to normal.
   ▶Yukino
So our drama club's good enough that it
can win competitions?
 ▶Yukino
Let's beat that Night Queen for the sake
of the three tower guardians.
▶Ayase
What a teeny-tiny room! I feel like I'm
in one big fridge...
   ▶Ayase
Student council president? More like
STUPID council president!
▶Ayase
It really pisses me off that a guy like
him ended up in charge!
 ▶Nanjo
Where did the other club rooms go?
 ▶Nanjo
There doesn't seem to be anything
useful here.
 ▶Brown
Here one may find the sweat and tears of
maidens who devoted their youth to acting.
▶Brown
Hey, what should we do!?
   ▶Brown
I wonder if TV studios are like this
backstage... I so want to see one.
▶Elly
Nothing but sheets and sheets of ice...
It's not beautiful at all; only cold.
   ▶Elly
Where could the other club members be?▶Male student
Ah, so you're here too, <LastName>.
▶Male student
Check it out! With all this, we can stand
up to the demons whenever they appear!
  ▶Male student
Huh? He's selling different stuff now...
It looks even more dangerous.
  ▶Male teacher
What is the matter with that child!?
▶Male teacher
This is a school! He can't open a store
here without permission!
▶Clerk
Welcoooome... I from Devil's Peak.
▶Clerk
Bring very good things.
▶Clerk
Mister need this. I sell at low price,
you buy!
 ▶Clerk
I been wait for you! Lucky mister.
▶Clerk
This store close soon. Last sale,
be waste if not buy!
  ▶Yukino
From Devil's Peak, huh? Then is that
kid a demon too...?
  ▶Yukino
It's making money off humans fighting
demons. That's one ballsy kid...!
   ▶Ayase
Hey, are these, like, real?
▶Ayase
I wonder where that kid's from.
▶Nanjo
Amazing! All of these could prove useful
for us.
   ▶Nanjo
I wonder how many times we survived
as a result of that child.
▶Nanjo
We should express our thanks, even if
its prices are a bit exorbitant.
  ▶Brown
Yikes, what's with the little arms dealer
at school?
▶Brown
...Well, I guess it's part of that small
stuff you're not supposed to sweat.
  ▶Brown
WHOA! Has it gotten even crazier here?
 ▶Elly
That child is supposedly a merchant
of death from the demon world.
  ▶Elly
Does that child care at all who wins
between us and the Queen?▶Female student
Squee! Look, look! This dress is
soooo cute!
  ▶Female student
Squee! Look, look! This skirt is
soooo cheap!
 ▶Yuko
Oh... such cute clothes... so expensive,
though...
  ▶Meek girl
Oh... such cute clothes... so expensive,
though...
 ▶Yuko
U-Um... Do you think this place will
buy uniforms...?

Maki's friend. She works part-time to
support her family.≻ 
 ▶Clerk
Wel... come...
 ▶Clerk
Wel... come...
 ▶Yukino
All these clothes have some practical use.
They're more like armor than clothes.
  ▶Yukino
Think this shopkeeper came from Devil's
Peak like the one across the hall?
▶Ayase
Oh man, this is soooo cool!
▶Ayase
Yikes... I wonder if I've gained weight.
   ▶Nanjo
The higher an item's price, the sturdier
it seems.
 ▶Nanjo
I wonder how often this armor has saved
our lives...
▶Nanjo
It's expensive, but I'm not complaining.
  ▶Brown
Hey, what's with this store selling these
crazy clothes at school?
▶Brown
...Eh, whatever. It's not like the school
regulations mean anything anymore.
▶Brown
Even if the school goes back to normal,
I'm gonna keep wearing stuff from here.
▶Elly
Could this be armor? I must say, it's
better than no protection whatsoever.
 ▶Elly
No wonder they stock high-quality goods.
If we died, they'd have no customers.▶Male student
Huh? What's with this song!?
▶Male student
It's all going to hell outside, but it's
hard to be nervous with this store around.
 ▶Clerk
Hello. Thanks for always being nice to
my great-grandson.
▶Clerk
I'm always watching from up above.
Heeheehee!
▶Clerk
Well! Rather chilly outside, isn't it?
 ▶Yukino
What's with the old guy? And what does
he mean by "up above"?
▶Yukino
And never mind that--why's there a
pharmacy here at school!?
   ▶Yukino
Where'd this store pop up from?
   ▶Ayase
Ooooooh! A frog! Sooooo cuuuute!
   ▶Ayase
I want this frog. Buy it for me, Daddy!
▶Nanjo
Why is there a pharmacy here...?
   ▶Nanjo
Is this a legitimate place of business?
▶Brown
No's-Bleed Z... Sounds like that'll
do the trick, all right.
   ▶Brown
Maybe I should buy up all the No's-Bleed Z
before things go back to normal...
  ▶Elly
So many suspicious medicines... I hope
they aren't harmful to one's health.
 ▶Elly
Aren't there more ordinary medicines,
for everyday use?
 ▶Frog
You're talking to a frog. A complete
stranger frog, at that. You must be bored.
▶Frog
I respect your curiosity. Here's a sample
recommended by Satomi Tadashi himself.

▶Frog
Sample Muscle Drink. That is my, Frog's,
essence. It's pure love for you.
▶Frog
Hmm. Missing a syllable.
   ▶Frog
N-No way. You have more than I do.
▶Frog
Rude to try to bum more from me.
You'll pay the piper, no doubt.
▶Frog
Just go die. No, no, seriously.
   ▶Frog
Just kidding. I give you three and you
don't even thank me?
▶Frog
Wait... don't tell me...

You're not stealing clothes and mini

▶Frog
Just go die. No, no, seriously.

Ooooooh! Sooooo cuuuute!

My impression of Ms. Yuka Ayase.
No, no, seriously.
▶Frog
...You're always so quiet.

I make a joke, and you stare at me with
your hands on your hips. No laughs.

In honor of your sullness, have a sample

This Balm of Life is so strong it brings

some! Pleeeease!
   ▶Ayase
I could stare at shiny stuff all day...!
   ▶Nanjo
What is this store? A sweets shop...?
Ahhh... a sweatshop. Yes, of course.
 ▶Nanjo
This "sweets shop" is rather bizarre.
  ▶Brown
Hey, why's there a sweets shop at school?
  ▶Brown
That reminds me... it's not cold in here!
  ▶Elly
Hm? This place isn't frozen...
Now why is that?
 ▶Elly
The stores here seem as if they exist in
another world. They're not cold at all.▶Female student
What are we going to do? There's no way
out. We're trapped in here!
▶Female student
The demons will get us eventually
anyways...
▶Female student
Tons of demons will invade and we'll all
be tortured to death!
 ▶Female student
Even if you defeat the Snow Queen, there
will still be demons left, right!?
▶Female student
We're sunk...
▶Female student
Who's the one who claimed the school was
safe? I wanna go home...
 ▶Female student
Why can't we get outside yet?
▶Female student
Are we forced to just sit here and wait
until we freeze to death?
▶Female student
I'm not having any of that! There's still
a lot I want to accomplish in life!
   ▶Satori
We're sunk. We were always going to die
someday... It's just been sped up a bit.
▶Satori
I get to go out while I'm still beautiful,
so I thank the Snow Queen for that.
  ▶Satori
When I keep my eyes shut like this, it's
like everything's stopped breathing.

It's so quiet. You know... I think I'm
starting... to get... slee... py...

Talk about an annoying bunch.

Let's go before they make me as crazy
as they are.

They're still spouting that crap. It's
depressing me, too... let's just go.
   ▶Ayase
Actually, I joke around a lot and stuff,
but I'm worried too.
▶Ayase
It's like, are we really gonna be able
to rescue Ms. Saeko?
▶Ayase
I mean, we're just high schoolers!
What can we do!?
  ▶Ayase
You're really strong, <FirstName>.
You never complain.

 ▶Elly
One sees a glimpse of humanity's true
nature during extreme conditions. Haha...▶Bizarre-looking man
My name is Igor... I am delighted to
make your acquaintance.
▶Igor
This place exists between dream and
reality, mind and matter...
▶Igor
It's been quite some time since we last
had a guest.
▶Igor
This is a room that only those bound by
a "contract" may enter...
▶Igor
From this day forth, you will be our
guest in this Velvet Room.
▶Igor
Your destiny will require you to hone
your power...
▶Igor
And for that, you will inevitably
require our help.
▶Igor
The Velvet Room is also known as the
room of Personas.
▶Igor
A Persona is a side of you that shows
itself when you face the world...
▶Igor
Think of it as a facade of protection
you wear to face hardships in life.
▶Igor
Hm... Perhaps that may have been rather
difficult to understand...
▶Igor
To battle opponents that cannot be
dealt with by human strength alone...
▶Igor
We in this room will lend you inhuman
power... The power of demons...
▶Igor
Now then. Allow me to explain my role
here...
▶Igor
I will assist you in giving birth to
new Personas.
▶Igor
The demons contained within the |ԏspell
cards|  you hold will be fused as one...
▶Igor
Thereby creating a new Persona.
▶Igor
Should you find yourselves with these
cards, please do bring them here.
  ▶Igor
Welcome to the Velvet Room...
   ▶Igor
What is it you desire?
▶Igor
Well then, what would you like
to know?Ԡ
   ▶Igor
I'm afraid you don't have enough |ԏspell
cards|  to give birth to a new Persona.
▶Igor
Alas, we cannot look after any more
Personas.
   ▶Igor
What would you like to do?Ԟ
▶Igor
Well then... Farewell...
▶Igor
If it's new Personas you want, I shall
fuse and create them for you.
▶Igor
First, though, I must summon demons to
fuse together into a Persona.
▶Igor
And for that, a certain type of card
is necessary.
▶Igor
You see, these cards are inscribed with
demon-summoning spells.
▶Igor
They are known as spell cards, and all
demons carry one.
▶Igor
Thus, in order to perform a fusion, I
will need you to gather spell cards.
▶Igor
Go forth, negotiate with demons,
and bring these spell cards back here.
▶Igor
Combat is not the only way to deal
with demons... Do you understand?
▶Igor
And not all demons are necessarily
wishing for a fight...
 ▶Igor
It isn't enough merely to fuse a new
Persona in order to make it your own...
▶Igor
There is rather more to it than that,
I'm afraid.
▶Igor
You must take a Persona onto yourself
in order to use its power.
▶Igor
Each of you is capable of holding up
to three Personas.
▶Igor
A newly-fused Persona will be entrusted
into my care.
▶Igor
By all means let me know when you
would like to take on new Personas.
▶Igor
But I can only look after 16 Personas
at a time, mind you.
▶Igor
There are as many Personas as there are
personalities... an infinite variety.
▶Igor
Each has its own form and substance,
to be used according to the situation.
▶Igor
If you can master that principle,
you will make a fine Persona-user.
▶Igor
Each of you can take on as many as
three Personas at once.
▶Igor
Of the three, only one can be actively
invoked during battle.
▶Igor
To invoke a Persona is to summon it
in combat.
▶Igor
The remaining two will remain on
standby...
▶Igor
Ready to be assumed at any time
during battle.
▶Igor
Different active Personas will grant
you different abilities.
▶Igor
Without the power of Persona, you are
no different than an ordinary human...
▶Igor
You will be powerless before the arcane
might of the demons' spells.
▶Igor
If by chance you were hit by a spell in
that state, you would be struck down.
▶Igor
But by taking on a Persona, your defense
against spells is considerably enhanced.
▶Igor
For some, it may also confer strength,
or increase luck for others.
▶Igor
This, too, is the power of Persona.
▶Igor
Though they are called Personas, each
is a hidden side of yourself.
▶Igor
I suggest you examine your status
carefully after assuming one.
▶Igor
That way, you can see which of your
qualities have changed.
▶Igor
At first, you will be unable to harness
your Persona's powers to the fullest.
▶Igor
But the more you invoke a Persona,
the more powers it will grant you.
▶Igor
As your Persona learns new skills, you
will have more options in battle.
▶Igor
Even if your Persona learns a powerful
skill, the SP required remains constant.
▶Igor
You will grow in combat, but do not
forget that your Personas grow as well.
▶Igor
Pardon me for being nosy, but...
▶Igor
Personas have eight levels of growth.
You should try to develop them fully.
▶Igor
I'm sure that there will be an ample
reward for doing so...
▶Igor
You might also be interested to know
about various factors in fusion.
▶Igor
For example, even when creating the
same Persona...
▶Igor
The combination of spell cards, the
affinities of the demons used...
▶Igor
The position of Terra and Luna, and any
essences added into the mix...
▶Igor
All of these factor into the resultant
Persona. And one more thing...
▶Igor
You may also add an item into the
fusion to trigger a change.
▶Igor
There are some items for which the
result is easily predictable...
▶Igor
But sometimes, even I will be unable
to guess at what may happen.
▶Igor
Should that come about, I do hope that
you'll pardon me.
▶Igor
But make no mistake, I do believe it
is worth trying...
▶Igor
I suggest gems for obtaining a higher-
or lower-ranked fusion within an order.
▶Igor
As for the other items' effects, you
should experiment for yourself.▶Yukino
Why a casino? Is the idea to forget
about reality and waste away?
▶Yukino
Oh well, no sense sweating the details.
Might as well take a short break.
  ▶Yukino
Why a casino? Is the idea to forget

 > It's a video poker machine.
 > What will you do?♀
 > What would you like explained?ԍ
In this version of poker, you can
change your hand once.
You will be dealt five cards at the
outset.
Use the directional buttons to move to
a card, and press the íȺႨȺùȺࠁ buttons
to hold that card.
Once you have chosen which cards to
hold, press the R button to re-draw
the remaining cards.
If you have a valid hand after the
second draw, you win.
The higher the bet, the larger the
payout for a winning hand will be.
If you win, you can bet the amount
you just won on an Extra Game.
If you'd rather not risk it, choose
"Take Winnings."
There are three types of Extra Game.
Each round you win doubles your
earnings.
By winning the Extra Game, you can
wager up to 1,000,000 coins.
But be careful; one mistake and you'll
lose it all.
<Extra Game 1>
ٰHigh & Low
One card is shown, with four other
cards left face-down.
You must guess which face-down card is
higher than the shown card.
If the card you draw has the same
number as the shown card, the game is
a draw and you may try again.
<Extra Game 2>
ٰBig & Small
One card is shown and one card is
face-down.
You must guess whether the face-down
card is bigger or smaller than the
shown card.
If both cards are equal, you lose,
so be careful.
<Extra Game 3>
ٰRed & Black

 > What would you like explained?ԍ
This is a one-on-one-game of blackjack
against the dealer.
The computer acts as the dealer.
Two cards are dealt to the player and
the dealer at the outset.
One of the dealer's two cards will be
kept face-down.
If the dealer's shown card is an ace,
you may place an insurance bet.
The insurance mechanic will be explained
at the end of these rules.
First, compare your cards to the dealer's
to decide whether to draw another card.
If you decide to draw, select Hit.
If not, select Stand.
You may draw up to 7 cards as long as
their total value remains 21 or lower.
The following circumstances will result
in an automatic Stand:
-Your initial draw is blackjack.
-The total of the cards drawn after
Hitting is 21.
-You draw seven cards.
-The cards' total value surpasses 21,
resulting in a bust.
2 through 10 are face value. J through
K are worth 10, and A is worth either
1 or 11.
After the player Stands, the dealer
will draw cards.
If your total is larger than the
dealer's without surpassing 21...
Or if the dealer busts, you win.
If you and the dealer tie, or if both
of you have blackjack, it is a draw,
and your bet will be returned to you.
Besides Hit and Stand, the player can
also choose to Double Down or Split.
 <D. Down> 
This is only an option while you still
have two cards in your hand.
You may double your bet under the
condition that you only Hit once.
This option will be unavailable if you
have fewer coins than the bet would be.
If you Double Down and beat the dealer,
your winnings will be doubled.
<Split>
You may Split if both of your initial
cards are the same value.
Your hand will be split, with a second
bet covering the other hand.
This option will be unavailable if you
have fewer coins than the bet would be.
Even after a Split, you may Double Down
on either or both hands.
However, if you split, even with a
combination of A with 10 through K...
It will be counted as 21 without being
considered blackjack.

ႬAbout insuranceႭ
An insurance bet is much as it sounds...
It can only be placed if the dealer's
first card is an ace.
Select Yes to place an insurance bet,
and No to decline.
If you select No, the game progresses
normally.
If you select Yes, you must first
pay half your bet as insurance.
If the dealer's second card is 10
through K, forming blackjack...
The initial bet is forfeited.
However...
The insurance bet will pay out at
3 to 1, and the game will end.
If the dealer's card is A through 9,
the insurance is lost and the game
progresses normally.
Since Ⴤ decks of cards are used in this
game, there is a chance that two or more
identical cards will be dealt.

 Winning the game:
If your hand is larger than the dealer's
without going over 21...
Or if the dealer busts, you win.

10 through K. (Automatically Stands.)
If you chose to Split, this will not
be counted as blackjack but is 21.
6 Cards:
If you choose Stand when you've drawn
six cards without surpassing 21.
7 Cards:
If you've drawn seven cards without
surpassing 21. (Automatically Stands.)
ॵȺࢼȺࣚ A & J:

This slot machine consists of ࿌
big reels and 16 small reels.
The number of ways to line up a win
increases with the size of your bet.
You can bet up to ৎ coins.
Bets 1, 2, ࿌, and 6 are for the
horizontal lines,while 3, Ⴤ, 7,
and ৎ are for the vertical lines.
Bets ࿌ through ৎ also add two ways
to line up a win per bet.
When the game begins, the big and small
reels will all start to spin.
Once the reels have spun enough,
the small reels will stop. (The big
reels will continue to spin.)
Press the í, Ⴈ, ù, and ࠁ buttons to
rotate the corresponding reels.
Adjust the small reels so that it will
be easier to line up a pattern.
When you have finished, press the
R button to stop the big reels.
If three or more of a symbol are lined
up along one of your bets, you win.
Up to five symbols can cross bets 1
through Ⴤ, and up to four can cross
bets ࿌ through ৎ.
When the symbols on the big reels match
diagonally, in all four corners, or all
five at once...
You win regardless of which lines you
bet on.
Earnings for hits on the big reels
increase according to the number of
bets you made.

   Different slot machines have different
patterns and odds.
It's best to try out different machines
rather than concentrating on one.
Be careful not to forget to rotate the
small reels during the game.
Careful adjustment of the small reels
is key to maximizing your payout.
If you begin the game with fewer bets,
you may face greater losses when it
matters most.
For best results, always play the game
with the full eight bets.

In this game, two dice are rolled on
screen, and you predict the outcome.
You can bet on eleven rolls, from 2
to 12, and you may bet on as many rolls
per game as you wish.
However, you may bet a maximum of 100
coins on any given roll.
If you bet on the correct roll, a
multiplier determines your winnings.
You can also stake your winnings on
an Extra Game.
In the Extra Game, you do not predict
the outcome of the roll...
Instead, any roll other than 7 wins.
The amount you win differs depending on
the roll.
If the roll is 7, the Extra Game ends
and all your winnings are lost, so be
careful.

The closer the roll is to 7, the lower
the multiplier. This is because rolls
close to 7 appear more frequently.
Thus, the safe bet is on rolls close
to 7, with rolls like 2 and 12 being
riskier.
In the Extra Game, if a roll of 7
comes up, you lose all your winnings.
The trick to not losing too much is
not to get greedy and leave with a
reasonable amount.▶Yukino

Huh? You're asking why I didn't go get
the teacher?

▶Brown
I seriously feel like some wilted lettuce
stuck in the fridge. It's depressing.

I thought about having some hot ramen,
but I can't boil any water.
▶Brown
Plus, Toro's freaking out. Says he's gonna
eat all the food to get over being dumped.
▶Brown
That's why I hurried to hide everything
except the dairy stuff.
▶Brown
I mean, who knows what'll happen, y'know?
I'm like, so on top of things!
 ▶Brown
The whole school's in a panic, and it
can't be easy for Teach, either.
▶Brown
I dunno how you did it, but I'm glad
everyone's calmed down.
▶Brown
Me and some other guy are gonna keep
watch, so you can leave it to us.

started ranting about milk and torture.

use it, anything might be possible.

Young ones... Your presence is welcome.
 ▶Agastya Tree
Will you inscribe your story on me? 
   ▶Agastya Tree
Take care on your journey, young ones...▶Yukino
I'd wondered where some of the students
had gone. Now I've got my answer...
▶Yukino
Just wait for us, guys. We'll rescue
you all soon!
   ▶Ayase
How awful... Who does stuff like this
for fun?
 ▶Nanjo
Mm. It seems the enemy is resorting to
force now.
  ▶Brown
Oh crap... oh crap...!
 ▶Elly
They appear to still be alive. Eternal
Night... so this is what it means.▶Reiho
Jab! Jab! Hee-ho!
▶Raiho
There's no sumo club hee-here, so we're
gonna join the boxing club, ho.
▶Reiho
Hey! A sandbag can't move like that!
▶Raiho
Hee-ho? Are you talking about me?
▶Reiho
Don't you hee-member? How the boy at the
fencing club was beaten up by a girl?
▶Raiho
Hee-ho! I see... so girls are strong, ho.
▶Raiho
...Please... ԏBe gentle... ԏokay? ԏHee-ho!
▶Yukino
These guys again...
   ▶Ayase
It's nice they get along so well.
  ▶Nanjo
They always act as though they're in the
middle of a stand-up routine.
 ▶Brown
Watching them really warms my heart.
   ▶Elly
I wonder if Jack Frosts actually have
distinct genders.> Touch the ball of light? 
  ▶Yukino
What just happened?
   ▶Yukino
Are we going through it again?
▶Ayase
Huh? I feel like we're missing someone...
  ▶Ayase
It's glowing, but it's cold.
   ▶Nanjo
Is everyone all right? What was that
just now...?
  ▶Nanjo
It seems that we can be teleported
elsewhere by touching this.
 ▶Brown
Huhhh!? What was that?
 ▶Brown
Staring at it hurts my eyes...
 ▶Elly
Has anything changed? Let's have a look
outside this room!
  ▶Elly
Could this be something like a wormhole?▶Yukino
Any wounds, <FirstName>?
▶Ayase
My hands are going numb.
   ▶Nanjo
How on earth is this building laid out?
It's hard to believe it was our school...
  ▶Brown
Whew, let's take a breather. I feel like
my legs are gonna fall off.
   ▶Elly
Both the demons and the building's
structure are becoming more formidable.> There seems to be nothing here.

the frozen floor.

▶Yukino
This girl looks like she wants to
say something...
▶Yukino
We gotta do all we can for these guys.
▶Ayase
Y'think they'd melt if I cast Agi on 'em?
  ▶Ayase
Y'think they'd melt if I cast Agi on 'em?
  ▶Nanjo
"Set your mind at ease that even the fire
may seem cool and refreshing."
▶Nanjo
Wait... That makes it feel even colder.
   ▶Nanjo
That was quite a windfall. One hardly
expects such an amazing find.
▶Brown
Dammit!
▶Brown
Night Queen or no, I'm not letting
whoever did this off the hook!
  ▶Brown
A main character's costume? It should go
to me, naturally! ...Oh, man...
▶Brown
It doesn't fit! Aw well... Much as it
breaks my heart to do this...
▶Brown
I guess I'll give it to you, <FirstName>.
Just kidding!
 ▶Brown
Hunh?
▶Brown
H-Hey! Look... There's something on
the floor.
▶Brown
I-I-Is it a 10,000-yen bill!? 'Cause if
it is, dibs!
▶Brown
Dibs, you hear me!? I saw it first!
  ▶Yukino
Do you ever stop being such a greedy
bastard!?
▶Brown
Oh, Yukino, please.
▶Brown
I would never steal money like that.
▶Brown
In fact, I'll offer it to you.
No, no, seriously.
 ▶Yukino
You moron. What I'm saying is, that's
not a 10,000-yen bill!
  ▶Brown
Huh? O-Ohhh... you're right. Awwww...
  ▶Ayase
Totally stupid. There's no doubt you'll
pay the piper.
 ▶Brown
U-Urgh! Why's Ayase saying that now!?
  ▶Brown
Awww...
▶Elly
Good heavens... here, too...?
   ▶Elly
What an incredible find!▶Yukino
How'd that girl get all the way up here?
  ▶Ayase
Hey, look! His eyelashes are frozen.
   ▶Nanjo
Under normal circumstances, I find Ayase
barely tolerable...
▶Nanjo
But it's something of a relief to have
her around at a time like this.
▶Brown
I'm starting to get sleepy...
  ▶Elly
The same scenery, wherever we go...
Are we really moving forward?
   ▶Girl with a camera
Oh, hello! Nice to meet you.
▶Girl with a camera
I'm Mariko Yabe from Yamakumo High's
Paranormal Watchers Club!
▶Mariko
Good to know you!
▶Mariko
It's an unofficial club, and I'm the
president and only member!
▶Mariko
My homeroom teach refuses to recognize my
club, just 'cause he thinks it's lame!
▶Mariko
So I came to visit Tsutomu, my fellow
devotee, but...  I...  this is...
▶Mariko
This is GREAT! I'm SO lucky I get to see
an awesome paranormal event like this!
▶Mariko
I was just exploring those three freaky
towers that popped up around campus!
▶Mariko
They're chock-full of demons! You wouldn't
believe the photos I got!
▶Mariko
I'm gonna submit these babies to some
national magazines!
▶Mariko
If the media admits they're real, maybe
my teach will recognize my club!
▶Mariko
Here goes nothin'!
   ▶Mariko
I'm pretty much done exploring the
towers, so I came back this way...
▶Mariko
But just like I thought, I'm pretty
bushed now.
▶Mariko
This is so exciting, though!
▶Mariko
"A Mysteriously Frozen School"!
"The Revival of Demons"!
▶Mariko
"The Bizarre Towers and the School that
Became a Labyrinth"!
▶Mariko
So what do you think?
▶Mariko
Me, I say it's all a secret conspiracy
to take over the world by sorcery...▶Reiho
Hee-ho! This is the Ⴤth floor.
 ▶Raiho
Hee-ho! Hey, you guys!
 ▶Raiho
Will you be friends with me? 
 ▶Raiho
Hee-ho! Just 9࿌ more people until I make
100 friends!
▶Raiho
Well, friends? Is there anything I can
do for you, ho?
▶Raiho
I hee-know!
   ▶Raiho
Want me-ho to take you upstairs? 
 ▶Reiho
Tch.
   ▶Raiho
Hee-ho! Well then, hee-close your eyes
for a minute, ho...
 ▶Reiho
Tch.
   ▶Yukino
It's those snowmen again. What are they
up to this time?
  ▶Ayase
I think they like, want you to talk
to them.
   ▶Nanjo
Are they lonesome?
 ▶Brown
I was looking at their mouths, and I got
this craving for watermelon.
  ▶Elly
It seems some demons are amiable and
naturally curious as well.▶Yukino
What is this floor?
   ▶Ayase
I've seen this room before... in an old,
framed photo in the principal's office.
▶Ayase
It's the wooden school building that was
here before they built the one we have.
  ▶Nanjo
I'd expect Ayase to know. She's certainly
been to the principal's office enough.
   ▶Brown
Warmth of handmade wooden buildings,
my ass!
▶Brown
The wind blows through the cracks in the
walls and it smells all musty...
▶Brown
Makes me want a hot bath.
   ▶Elly
This certainly is an antique building.
If we weren't in our current situation,
▶Elly
I'd have enjoyed looking around.▶Yukino
Did the building change because the past
Snow Queens attended class in this one?
▶Yukino
...That would mean the demons have gotten
even stronger.
▶Ayase
So people back then went to class in
rooms like these? Weren't they cold...?
   ▶Nanjo
Mayuzumi is right. From this point on,
we should brace for the worst.
  ▶Brown
This place creeps me out. It's bad enough
that it's an old building...
▶Brown
But it's all frozen over, and our
footsteps echo way too loud.
  ▶Elly
It's said many generations of memories
are ingrained into old schools.
▶Elly
I only hope that doesn't mean evil things
are in store for us.▶Reiho
Hee-ho! This is the ࿌th floor.
 ▶Raiho
Hee-ho!
▶Raiho
Want me-ho to take you downstairs? 
▶Reiho
Tch.
  ▶Raiho
Hee-ho! Well then, hee-close your eyes
for a minute, ho...
 ▶Reiho
Tch.
   ▶Yukino
What kind of magic trick is this
snowman using?
   ▶Ayase
Whoa... this is like, kinda creepy...
  ▶Nanjo
It's a wooden building now, I see.
▶Nanjo
Did the Night Queen run out of funds to
complete the castle's construction?
 ▶Brown
Oh, hell no! This place is even colder!
▶Elly
This place...▶Yukino
That Night Queen was calling the frozen
school an Ice Castle...
▶Yukino
And yeah, it's a castle, all right.
Going forward is a real pain.
▶Ayase
I've always been bad at stuff like mazes
and funhouses. Grrrr! This, like, sucks!
  ▶Nanjo
I'm considering implementing a labyrinth
to enhance my home security. Well?
▶Brown
Why's this place so huge!? Does it
actually end...?
▶Elly
There is no turning back now.▶Yukino
Yuka's acting like a child again. Though
this time, I can see why.
▶Ayase
Seriously! Isn't there some cool spell
that'll warp us right to the Queen!?
▶Nanjo
This place is as spacious as my own
home. I'm impressed.
   ▶Brown
Whew! Let's take five.
 ▶Elly
I've wondered for some time now...
What do you fight for, <FirstName>?▶Masked man
Yes?
  ▶Masked man
Do you want to go back downstairs?ԝ
  ▶Masked man
I see. Then hurry to the highest floor.
The Queen awaits.
 ▶Masked man
Very well.
▶Masked man
Very well.
▶Masked man
So you've come this far, yet you still
wish to return to the beginning.
▶Masked man
Well, so be it.
  ▶Yukino
What's he scheming?
   ▶Ayase
He said he'll do it for us. If we wanna
go back, let's try asking him.
 ▶Nanjo
......
 ▶Brown
Hey, you're not gonna say "yes" after we
came this far, are you?
   ▶Elly
Be careful. We can't say for sure yet
whether he's human or demon.▶Trish
Hi! I'm Trish and this is my fountain
of healing!
▶Trish
This world runs on give-and-take! Give
me money and I'll take away your pain!
▶Trish
What do you say?ԙ
 ▶Trish
Okay!
  ▶Trish
Umm, with the going rate for healing...
And all of you put together...
 ▶Trish
It'll be ৎ,000 yen.
That's okay, right? 
  ▶Trish
Great! Then here goes!
Pain, pain, go away!
▶Trish
Phew... That should do it!
You're all good to go!
▶Trish
Need anything else? 
▶Trish
You don't have enough!? Boo to that!
There's nothing I hate like poor people!
▶Trish
Come back when your wallet's fuller.
Bye-bye!
▶Trish
Boo to that! You mangy, dirty bum!
Don't blame me if you wind up dead!
 ▶Trish
Well, come again. I'll be waiting!
Bye-bye!
▶Trish
You called me out for no reason!?
Boo to that! Get outta here!▶Bizarre-looking man
My name is Igor... I am delighted to
make your acquaintance.
▶Igor
This place exists between dream and
reality, mind and matter...
▶Igor
It's been quite some time since we last
had a guest.
▶Igor
This is a room that only those bound by
a "contract" may enter...
▶Igor
From this day forth, you will be our
guest in this Velvet Room.
▶Igor
Your destiny will require you to hone
your power...
▶Igor
And for that, you will inevitably
require our help.
▶Igor
The Velvet Room is also known as the
room of Personas.
▶Igor
A Persona is a side of you that shows
itself when you face the world...
▶Igor
Think of it as a facade of protection
you wear to face hardships in life.
▶Igor
Hm... Perhaps that may have been rather
difficult to understand...
▶Igor
To battle opponents that cannot be
dealt with by human strength alone...
▶Igor
We in this room will lend you inhuman
power... The power of demons...
▶Igor
Now then. Allow me to explain my role
here...
▶Igor
I will assist you in giving birth to
new Personas.
▶Igor
The demons contained within the |ԏspell
cards|  you hold will be fused as one...
▶Igor
Thereby creating a new Persona.
▶Igor
Should you find yourselves with these
cards, please do bring them here.
  ▶Igor
Welcome to the Velvet Room...
   ▶Igor
What is it you desire?
▶Igor
Well then, what would you like
to know?Ԡ
   ▶Igor
I'm afraid you don't have enough |ԏspell
cards|  to give birth to a new Persona.
▶Igor
Alas, we cannot look after any more
Personas.
   ▶Igor
What would you like to do?Ԟ
▶Igor
Well then... Farewell...
▶Igor
If it's new Personas you want, I shall
fuse and create them for you.
▶Igor
First, though, I must summon demons to
fuse together into a Persona.
▶Igor
And for that, a certain type of card
is necessary.
▶Igor
You see, these cards are inscribed with
demon-summoning spells.
▶Igor
They are known as spell cards, and all
demons carry one.
▶Igor
Thus, in order to perform a fusion, I
will need you to gather spell cards.
▶Igor
Go forth, negotiate with demons,
and bring these spell cards back here.
▶Igor
Combat is not the only way to deal
with demons... Do you understand?
▶Igor
And not all demons are necessarily
wishing for a fight...
 ▶Igor
It isn't enough merely to fuse a new
Persona in order to make it your own...
▶Igor
There is rather more to it than that,
I'm afraid.
▶Igor
You must take a Persona onto yourself
in order to use its power.
▶Igor
Each of you is capable of holding up
to three Personas.
▶Igor
A newly-fused Persona will be entrusted
into my care.
▶Igor
By all means let me know when you
would like to take on new Personas.
▶Igor
But I can only look after 16 Personas
at a time, mind you.
▶Igor
There are as many Personas as there are
personalities... an infinite variety.
▶Igor
Each has its own form and substance,
to be used according to the situation.
▶Igor
If you can master that principle,
you will make a fine Persona-user.
▶Igor
Each of you can take on as many as
three Personas at once.
▶Igor
Of the three, only one can be actively
invoked during battle.
▶Igor
To invoke a Persona is to summon it
in combat.
▶Igor
The remaining two will remain on
standby...
▶Igor
Ready to be assumed at any time
during battle.
▶Igor
Different active Personas will grant
you different abilities.
▶Igor
Without the power of Persona, you are
no different than an ordinary human...
▶Igor
You will be powerless before the arcane
might of the demons' spells.
▶Igor
If by chance you were hit by a spell in
that state, you would be struck down.
▶Igor
But by taking on a Persona, your defense
against spells is considerably enhanced.
▶Igor
For some, it may also confer strength,
or increase luck for others.
▶Igor
This, too, is the power of Persona.
▶Igor
Though they are called Personas, each
is a hidden side of yourself.
▶Igor
I suggest you examine your status
carefully after assuming one.
▶Igor
That way, you can see which of your
qualities have changed.
▶Igor
At first, you will be unable to harness
your Persona's powers to the fullest.
▶Igor
But the more you invoke a Persona,
the more powers it will grant you.
▶Igor
As your Persona learns new skills, you
will have more options in battle.
▶Igor
Even if your Persona learns a powerful
skill, the SP required remains constant.
▶Igor
You will grow in combat, but do not
forget that your Personas grow as well.
▶Igor
Pardon me for being nosy, but...
▶Igor
Personas have eight levels of growth.
You should try to develop them fully.
▶Igor
I'm sure that there will be an ample
reward for doing so...
▶Igor
You might also be interested to know
about various factors in fusion.
▶Igor
For example, even when creating the
same Persona...
▶Igor
The combination of spell cards, the
affinities of the demons used...
▶Igor
The position of Terra and Luna, and any
essences added into the mix...
▶Igor
All of these factor into the resultant
Persona. And one more thing...
▶Igor
You may also add an item into the
fusion to trigger a change.
▶Igor
There are some items for which the
result is easily predictable...
▶Igor
But sometimes, even I will be unable
to guess at what may happen.
▶Igor
Should that come about, I do hope that
you'll pardon me.
▶Igor
But make no mistake, I do believe it
is worth trying...
▶Igor
I suggest gems for obtaining a higher-
or lower-ranked fusion within an order.
▶Igor
As for the other items' effects, you
should experiment for yourself.▶Agastya Tree
Young ones... Your presence is welcome.

 ▶Nanjo
That fiend! What's it doing inside
the school!?

Ahahaha... Run! Run away, or you'll
be frozen as well.
▶Toro's voice
Waaaaah! Stop, stop--Nooooo!
▶Nurse Natsumi's voice
Hey! Who're you...!? Aaaaa... aaaargh...
  ▶Ayase
Toro? Nurse Natsumi!? No...
This can't be...
   ▶Yukino
Ms. Saeko!?
   ▶Ms. Saeko
Almost everyone in the school building
is frozen.
▶Ms. Saeko
I gotta get you out before the
Queen returns...
  ▶Student's spirit
Please, run away! You must live on!
 ▶Ayase
R-Run away? But how!?
  ▶Student's spirit
We'll use what power we have left to
send you all out of the school.
▶Yukino
We can't just run away with our tails
between our legs! No way, I'm staying--
 ▶Ms. Saeko
It's coming back! There's no time!
Are you ready?
▶Ms. Saeko
<FirstName>! I'm leaving everyone in
your hands! Please... survive for us...

▶Igor
You will grow in combat, but do not
forget that your Personas grow as well.
▶Igor
Pardon me for being nosy, but...
▶Igor
Personas have eight levels of growth.
You should try to develop them fully.
▶Igor
I'm sure that there will be an ample
reward for doing so...
▶Igor
You might also be interested to know
about various factors in fusion.
▶Igor
For example, even when creating the
same Persona...
▶Igor
The combination of spell cards, the
affinities of the demons used...
▶Igor
The position of Terra and Luna, and any
essences added into the mix...
▶Igor
All of these factor into the resultant
Persona. And one more thing...
▶Igor
You may also add an item into the
fusion to trigger a change.
▶Igor
There are some items for which the
result is easily predictable...
▶Igor
But sometimes, even I will be unable
to guess at what may happen.
▶Igor
Should that come about, I do hope that
you'll pardon me.
▶Igor
But make no mistake, I do believe it
is worth trying...
▶Igor
I suggest gems for obtaining a higher-
or lower-ranked fusion within an order.
▶Igor
As for the other items' effects, you
should experiment for yourself.▶Trish
Hi! I'm Trish and this is my fountain
of healing!
▶Trish
This world runs on give-and-take! Give
me money and I'll take away your pain!
▶Trish
What do you say?ԙ
 ▶Trish
Okay!
  ▶Trish
Umm, with the going rate for healing...
And all of you put together...
 ▶Trish
It'll be 1,000 yen.
That's okay, right? 
  ▶Trish
Great! Then here goes!
Pain, pain, go away!
▶Trish
Phew... That should do it!
You're all good to go!
▶Trish
Need anything else? 
▶Trish
You don't have enough!? Boo to that!
There's nothing I hate like poor people!
▶Trish
Come back when your wallet's fuller.
Bye-bye!
▶Trish
Boo to that! You mangy, dirty bum!
Don't blame me if you wind up dead!
 ▶Trish
Well, come again. I'll be waiting!
Bye-bye!
▶Trish
You called me out for no reason!?
Boo to that! Get outta here!▶Girl with a camera
Oh, hello! Nice to meet you.
▶Girl with a camera
I'm Mariko Yabe from Yamakumo High's
Paranormal Watchers Club!
▶Mariko
Good to know you!
▶Mariko
It's an unofficial club, and I'm the
president and only member!
▶Mariko
My homeroom teach refuses to recognize my
club, just 'cause he thinks it's lame!
▶Mariko
So I came to visit Tsutomu, my fellow
devotee, but...  I...  this is...
▶Mariko
This is GREAT! I'm SO lucky I get to see
an awesome paranormal event like this!
▶Mariko
I was just exploring those three freaky
towers that popped up around campus!
▶Mariko
They're chock-full of demons! You wouldn't
believe the photos I got!
▶Mariko
I'm gonna submit these babies to some
national magazines!
▶Mariko
If the media admits they're real, maybe
my teach will recognize my club!
▶Mariko
Here goes nothin'!
   ▶Mariko
Huh? They don't sell film here... Ugh!
Of all the rotten luck!
▶Clerk
Welcoooome... I from Devil's Peak.
▶Clerk
Bring very good things.
▶Clerk
Mister need this. I sell at low price,
you buy!
 ▶Yukino
From Devil's Peak, huh? Then is that
kid a demon too...?
  ▶Ayase
Hey, are these, like, real?
▶Nanjo
Amazing! All of these could prove useful
for us.
   ▶Brown
Yikes, what's with the little arms dealer
at school?
▶Brown
...Well, I guess it's part of that small
stuff you're not supposed to sweat.
  ▶Elly
That child is supposedly a merchant
of death from the demon world.▶Clerk
Wel... come...
 ▶Yukino
All these clothes have some practical use.
They're more like armor than clothes.
  ▶Ayase
Oh man, this is soooo cool!
▶Nanjo
The higher an item's price, the sturdier
it seems.
 ▶Brown
Oh man, this is totally perfect for me!
▶Brown
Though I look good in anything, of course.
Mwahahahaha!
▶Elly
Could this be armor? I must say, it's
better than no protection whatsoever.▶Yukino
So we have until the hour hand points to
12 o'clock... This won't be easy.
▶Ayase
I've been feeling totally sleepy ever
since we came to this tower!
 ▶Nanjo
That Snow Queen... I'm sure it's sneering
as it watches us gather |ԍmirror shards| .
   ▶Brown
Hey, don't you feel all sleepy for some
reason? No, no, I mean it.
 ▶Elly
I wonder what kind of foe awaits us in
this tower.▶Kumi's father
...Are you still up fooling around with
that script, Kumi?
▶Kumi's father
Refresh my memory, what are you going
to school for again?
▶Kumi's father
To study? Or to fool around?
 ▶Kumi
U-Um... it's just... the "Snow Queen,"
see... I was pick--
  ▶Kumi's father
Yes, your mother told me. Apparently you
scored in the 70s on some tests lately?
▶Kumi's father
You get those low scores because you don't
study. You just fool around all the time.
  ▶Kumi
But--My average was eighty--
▶Kumi's father
I gave up drinking and smoking, as much
as I loved them...
▶Kumi's father
And I quit playing golf on weekends so I
could make more money.
▶Kumi's father
Who do you think that's for!?
▶Kumi's father
I'm providing for you and your mother,
aren't I?
▶Kumi's father
You're attending that school now because
your father's working himself to death.
 ▶Kumi
...I know, Father.
  ▶Kumi's father
But you still don't even think about what
I'm going through...
▶Kumi's father
Instead, you get lost in some club and
never spend a moment studying.
▶Kumi's father
You're in the wrong here, Kumi.
▶Kumi
...I'm sorry...
▶Kumi's father
See, you understand. So why don't you
drop that script and hit the books?
▶Kumi's father
Keep studying and get a good job at a
good company so you can repay us someday.
▶Kumi's father
Hahah...
 ▶Kumi
......▶Kumi
...Why is everyone cross at me?
What did I do?
▶Kumi
Whether I do or don't do anything,
it's always like that... All of them...
▶Kumi
The world around me. The people around me.
▶Kumi
Everyone's so... full of hostility...
I feel like I don't have any freedom...
▶Kumi
Do I have to exist in this reality with
all these other people...?
▶Kumi
If only there was a gentle world...
filled with gentle people...
▶Kumi
A whole world full of kindness and
generosity... where I could be free...
▶Kumi
Some dream, huh...?
▶Kumi
Hah... Yeah, a dream... that only happens
when I'm asleep in this bed...
▶Kumi
It's the only free world I have left,
where no one complains about me...
▶Kumi
The world of dreams... I wish I could
just live there...
▶Kumi
In my dream world, made only for me...▶Agastya Tree
Ah. It seems that you are rather
exhausted, young ones.
▶Agastya Tree
Halting your journey here to rest for
the time being may be a wise decision.
▶Agastya Tree
But I cannot inscribe your story
onto myself.
▶Agastya Tree
I am only keeping it for your sake until
you depart again... Do not forget that...
  ▶Agastya Tree
Will you put a temporary halt to
your journey? 
▶Agastya Tree
Young ones... I will remember the story
of your journey for you.
▶Agastya Tree
Take care on your journey, young ones...▶Yukino
We've come pretty far up. I think we're
near the end.
▶Yukino
I better get psyched for what's coming!
▶Ayase
Urgh, I'm soooo tired! Sheesh!
Isn't there like, an elevator around!?
  ▶Nanjo
Even if we pick up high-quality equipment,
it's useless unless we put it on.
▶Nanjo
Be sure to check what you're using from
time to time.
 ▶Brown
Gaaaah! I'm so tired! For crying out
loud, can't we take a little rest?
▶Elly
Fortunately, we didn't fall asleep.
Let's stay cautious and press onward.▶Agastya Tree
Young ones... Your presence is welcome.
 ▶Agastya Tree
Will you inscribe your story on me?

My name is Igor... I am delighted to
make your acquaintance.
▶Igor
This place exists between dream and
reality, mind and matter...
▶Igor
It's been quite some time since we last
had a guest.
▶Igor
This is a room that only those bound by
a "contract" may enter...
▶Igor
From this day forth, you will be our
guest in this Velvet Room.
▶Igor
Your destiny will require you to hone
your power...
▶Igor
And for that, you will inevitably
require our help.
▶Igor
The Velvet Room is also known as the
room of Personas.
▶Igor
A Persona is a side of you that shows
itself when you face the world...
▶Igor
Think of it as a facade of protection
you wear to face hardships in life.
▶Igor
Hm... Perhaps that may have been rather
difficult to understand...
▶Igor
To battle opponents that cannot be
dealt with by human strength alone...
▶Igor
We in this room will lend you inhuman
power... The power of demons...
▶Igor
Now then. Allow me to explain my role
here...
▶Igor
I will assist you in giving birth to
new Personas.
▶Igor
The demons contained within the |ԏspell
cards|  you hold will be fused as one...
▶Igor
Thereby creating a new Persona.
▶Igor
Should you find yourselves with these
cards, please do bring them here.
  ▶Igor
Welcome to the Velvet Room...
   ▶Igor
What is it you desire?
▶Igor
Well then, what would you like
to know?Ԡ
   ▶Igor
I'm afraid you don't have enough |ԏspell
cards|  to give birth to a new Persona.
▶Igor
Alas, we cannot look after any more
Personas.
   ▶Igor
What would you like to do?Ԟ
▶Igor
Well then... Farewell...
▶Igor
If it's new Personas you want, I shall
fuse and create them for you.
▶Igor
First, though, I must summon demons to
fuse together into a Persona.
▶Igor
And for that, a certain type of card
is necessary.
▶Igor
You see, these cards are inscribed with
demon-summoning spells.
▶Igor
They are known as spell cards, and all
demons carry one.
▶Igor
Thus, in order to perform a fusion, I
will need you to gather spell cards.
▶Igor
Go forth, negotiate with demons,
and bring these spell cards back here.
▶Igor
Combat is not the only way to deal
with demons... Do you understand?
▶Igor
And not all demons are necessarily
wishing for a fight...
 ▶Igor
It isn't enough merely to fuse a new
Persona in order to make it your own...
▶Igor
There is rather more to it than that,
I'm afraid.
▶Igor
You must take a Persona onto yourself
in order to use its power.
▶Igor
Each of you is capable of holding up
to three Personas.
▶Igor
A newly-fused Persona will be entrusted
into my care.
▶Igor
By all means let me know when you
would like to take on new Personas.
▶Igor
But I can only look after 16 Personas
at a time, mind you.
▶Igor
There are as many Personas as there are
personalities... an infinite variety.
▶Igor
Each has its own form and substance,
to be used according to the situation.
▶Igor
If you can master that principle,
you will make a fine Persona-user.
▶Igor
Each of you can take on as many as
three Personas at once.
▶Igor
Of the three, only one can be actively
invoked during battle.
▶Igor
To invoke a Persona is to summon it
in combat.
▶Igor
The remaining two will remain on
standby...
▶Igor
Ready to be assumed at any time
during battle.
▶Igor
Different active Personas will grant
you different abilities.
▶Igor
Without the power of Persona, you are
no different than an ordinary human...
▶Igor
You will be powerless before the arcane
might of the demons' spells.
▶Igor
If by chance you were hit by a spell in
that state, you would be struck down.
▶Igor
But by taking on a Persona, your defense
against spells is considerably enhanced.
▶Igor
For some, it may also confer strength,
or increase luck for others.
▶Igor
This, too, is the power of Persona.
▶Igor
Though they are called Personas, each
is a hidden side of yourself.
▶Igor
I suggest you examine your status
carefully after assuming one.
▶Igor
That way, you can see which of your
qualities have changed.
▶Igor
At first, you will be unable to harness
your Persona's powers to the fullest.
▶Igor
But the more you invoke a Persona,
the more powers it will grant you.
▶Igor
As your Persona learns new skills, you
will have more options in battle.
▶Igor
Even if your Persona learns a powerful
skill, the SP required remains constant.
▶Igor
You will grow in combat, but do not
forget that your Personas grow as well.
▶Igor
Pardon me for being nosy, but...
▶Igor
Personas have eight levels of growth.
You should try to develop them fully.
▶Igor
I'm sure that there will be an ample
reward for doing so...
▶Igor
You might also be interested to know
about various factors in fusion.
▶Igor
For example, even when creating the
same Persona...
▶Igor
The combination of spell cards, the
affinities of the demons used...
▶Igor
The position of Terra and Luna, and any
essences added into the mix...
▶Igor
All of these factor into the resultant
Persona. And one more thing...
▶Igor
You may also add an item into the
fusion to trigger a change.
▶Igor
There are some items for which the
result is easily predictable...
▶Igor
But sometimes, even I will be unable
to guess at what may happen.
▶Igor
Should that come about, I do hope that
you'll pardon me.
▶Igor
But make no mistake, I do believe it
is worth trying...
▶Igor
I suggest gems for obtaining a higher-
or lower-ranked fusion within an order.
▶Igor
As for the other items' effects, you
should experiment for yourself.▶Trish
Hi! I'm Trish and this is my fountain
of healing!

behind this school-freezing phenomenon!

Have you been abducted by any UFOs in
the last two or three days?
  ▶Clerk
Welcoooome... I from Devil's Peak.
▶Clerk
Bring very good things.
▶Clerk
Mister need this. I sell at low price,
you buy!
 ▶Yukino
Hey, how come all the vendors at every
weapon shop have the same face?
▶Ayase
Ew, it smells like oil here!
   ▶Nanjo
Incredible! These items are all very
specialized.
  ▶Brown
Yikes, what's with the little arms dealer
at school?
▶Brown
...Well, I guess it's part of that small
stuff you're not supposed to sweat.
  ▶Elly
I wonder where in the demon world that
child amassed such a stockpile...▶Clerk
Wel... come...
 ▶Yukino
There's no time limit on this tower.
Let's take our time and prepare.
 ▶Ayase
Heeey! This is like, totally cute!
 ▶Nanjo
Good armor is the equivalent of life
insurance in this place.
  ▶Brown
Oh man, it's like this one is begging
me to wear it.
▶Brown
It's true that some clothes are only
worthy of a handsome man. Mwahahahaha!
   ▶Elly
Why is it that all the armory shopkeepers
wear masks?▶Yukino
What a gaudy door.
▶Yukino
Just the kind of thing Michiko would
use... It makes me sick!
 ▶Ayase
I wonder if that Michiko girl ever, like,
played the part of the "Snow Queen," too.
▶Nanjo
Hmph! The woman's door is as infuriating
as she is!
▶Nanjo
All show on the outside, lacking any
substance within!
 ▶Brown
I wish I could take this door back to my
room! It's one kickass door...
▶Elly
Er... If this door is meant to be a trap,
it's a rather obvious one.
> Open the door?▶Yukino
Oh, for the love of... not again.
▶Yukino
What's with these hideous doors!?
▶Yukino
Wasn't there one like it earlier, too?
  ▶Ayase
It's like, we walk and walk and we never
get to the top! I! AM! TIRED!
 ▶Nanjo
Dammit... I can sense Michiko's malice
in the air itself!
  ▶Brown
Yukino's right! There was a room like
this downstairs, too!
▶Elly
I feel that this tower is much higher than
it appears from outside. Is it just me?
  > Open the door?▶Yukino
Ugh! I can't stand this claustrophobic
feeling this tower gives me!
   ▶Ayase
I wonder if Toro and Tsutomu are okay...
   ▶Nanjo
This is one time I won't be holding back!
What that Michiko did is unforgiveable!
  ▶Brown
Alright! Looks like Michiko's room is
coming up soon!
▶Brown
Might as well check our equipment, huh?
  ▶Elly
Whew... this is tiring, both mentally and
physically. Is that also Michiko's fault?▶Agastya Tree
Ah. It seems that you are rather
exhausted, young ones.

Having no time limit is even more
ominous, in a way.
▶Yukino
I think we should hurry on ahead.
   ▶Ayase
This tower is, like, totally creepy,
y'know? Let's hurry and get through it.
   ▶Nanjo
Gah, that Michiko woman gets on my nerves!
She's infuriating! Truly infuriating!
   ▶Brown
Hey, c'mon! There's no time limit on this
tower, right? So let's take a break!
▶Brown
We can kick back a bit and then get
right to it!
▶Elly
Can we hurry ahead with all possible
haste? I can't shake this feeling...▶Agastya Tree

You will grow in combat, but do not
forget that your Personas grow as well.
▶Igor
Pardon me for being nosy, but...
▶Igor
Personas have eight levels of growth.
You should try to develop them fully.
▶Igor
I'm sure that there will be an ample
reward for doing so...
▶Igor
You might also be interested to know
about various factors in fusion.
▶Igor
For example, even when creating the
same Persona...
▶Igor
The combination of spell cards, the
affinities of the demons used...
▶Igor
The position of Terra and Luna, and any
essences added into the mix...
▶Igor
All of these factor into the resultant
Persona. And one more thing...
▶Igor
You may also add an item into the
fusion to trigger a change.
▶Igor
There are some items for which the
result is easily predictable...
▶Igor
But sometimes, even I will be unable
to guess at what may happen.
▶Igor
Should that come about, I do hope that
you'll pardon me.
▶Igor
But make no mistake, I do believe it
is worth trying...
▶Igor
I suggest gems for obtaining a higher-
or lower-ranked fusion within an order.
▶Igor
As for the other items' effects, you
should experiment for yourself.▶Trish
Hi! I'm Trish and this is my fountain
of healing!
▶Trish
This world runs on give-and-take! Give
me money and I'll take away your pain!
▶Trish
What do you say?ԙ
 ▶Trish
Okay!
  ▶Trish
Umm, with the going rate for healing...
And all of you put together...
 ▶Trish
It'll be 6,000 yen.
That's okay, right? 
  ▶Trish
Great! Then here goes!
Pain, pain, go away!
▶Trish
Phew... That should do it!
You're all good to go!
▶Trish
Need anything else? 
▶Trish
You don't have enough!? Boo to that!
There's nothing I hate like poor people!
▶Trish
Come back when your wallet's fuller.
Bye-bye!
▶Trish
Boo to that! You mangy, dirty bum!
Don't blame me if you wind up dead!
 ▶Trish
Well, come again. I'll be waiting!
Bye-bye!
▶Trish
You called me out for no reason!?
Boo to that! Get outta here!▶Girl with a camera
Oh, hello! Nice to meet you.
▶Girl with a camera
I'm Mariko Yabe from Yamakumo High's
Paranormal Watchers Club!
▶Mariko
Good to know you!
▶Mariko
It's an unofficial club, and I'm the
president and only member!
▶Mariko
My homeroom teach refuses to recognize my
club, just 'cause he thinks it's lame!
▶Mariko
So I came to visit Tsutomu, my fellow
devotee, but...  I...  this is...
▶Mariko
This is GREAT! I'm SO lucky I get to see
an awesome paranormal event like this!
▶Mariko
I was just exploring those three freaky
towers that popped up around campus!
▶Mariko
They're chock-full of demons! You wouldn't
believe the photos I got!
▶Mariko
I'm gonna submit these babies to some
national magazines!
▶Mariko
If the media admits they're real, maybe
my teach will recognize my club!
▶Mariko
Here goes nothin'!
   ▶Mariko
I'm thinkin' about interviewing some
demons, but I don't have a recorder.
▶Mariko
Hey, you know anyplace that might
sell some?
   ▶Clerk
Welcoooome... I from Devil's Peak.
▶Clerk
Bring very good things.
▶Clerk
Mister need this. I sell at low price,
you buy!
 ▶Yukino
Considering how far we've come, it's no
surprise the items are getting pricier.
   ▶Ayase
That clerk's clothes are so cute!
I want some like that!
   ▶Nanjo
Astounding! But they're all so expensive.
▶Nanjo
Still, we can't simply go without. This
is what's known as a Hobson's choice.
▶Brown
Oh, man! I want this one, and that
one too.
▶Brown
But they're so expensive! Hmm...
   ▶Elly
I wonder what that child intends to do
with the proceeds...▶Clerk
Wel... come...
 ▶Yukino
Not that I care, but the armory clerks
sure are creepy.
   ▶Ayase
Look! It's like, soooo charming!
   ▶Nanjo
The heaviness of sturdier armor can be
a fly in the ointment.
  ▶Brown
Man, I look good in just about anything.
▶Brown
So it takes me forever to decide!
Mwahahahaha!
▶Elly
Where was this armor imported from?
▶Elly
It gives one rather a turn to consider
its origin...▶Yukino
Even now, our time keeps slipping away.
It's frustrating.
▶Yukino
Makes me think I might be powerless
after all.
 ▶Ayase
It's kinda nice, having everyone work
together toward something like this.
 ▶Nanjo
*ahem*... How much longer do you intend
that we stay here?
 ▶Brown
It sucks that this happened to our school,
no doubt about that...
▶Brown
But then again, it's a break from our
boring everyday lives! That's kinda cool!
  ▶Elly
Thanatos Tower and Tartarus... It's all
like something from Greek mythology.▶Yukino
So mirror shards can be in treasure
boxes, too!
▶Yukino
Let's try and check as many treasure
boxes as we can, time permitting.
   ▶Ayase
I always get goosebumps when we're about
to open up a treasure box!
▶Nanjo
It's always so unsightly to witness one
rummaging through treasure boxes.
▶Nanjo
Oh, no, I didn't mean you in particular.
Just... in the general sense. Yes.
  ▶Brown
Hey, to tell you the truth, you're so
quiet, I always thought you were weird...
▶Brown
But after fighting along with you, I get
it now! You're one hip, happenin' dude!
▶Brown
You're like, the next strongest and
second most reliable, after me!
▶Brown
I gotta give you props! Seriously.
▶Elly
I admit, my opinion of you has slightly
improved.
▶Elly
You haven't uttered a word of complaint,
even in a situation like this...
▶Elly
You've been a real unifying force. I never
knew you had such a brave heart.
   > Open the box? 
 > Obtained Ẅ♀|ԍMirror Shard| .
> You decide not to open the treasure box.
> The treasure box is already empty.▶Yukino
I wonder if this Tartarus is Yuriko's
treasure hoard.
▶Yukino
There sure are a lot of boxes here.
▶Ayase
Hey, if we beat the Snow Queen and rescue
Ms. Saeko... that's it, right?
▶Ayase
Everyone will go back to normal, and we
can, like, go home, right?
▶Nanjo
I'm worried about Ms. Saeko, of course,
but that Masao...
▶Nanjo
I wonder if he's all right. He isn't
very smart, after all.
▶Nanjo
Damn and blast!
  ▶Brown
Ughhhh! This is supposedly the world
after death, but there's nothing here.
▶Brown
Boooooriiiiiing!
▶Brown
Hey! Let's start heading back up the
tower and go see Yuriko!
 ▶Elly
Haha... it's really rather amusing.
▶Elly
We five never knew each other well, yet
here we are on an adventure together...
▶Elly
And not only that... part of me takes
a real delight in this situation.
▶Elly
It really is amazing...▶Yukino
It sounds strange saying this in the
world after death, but...
▶Yukino
I hope we all make it back alive.
 ▶Ayase
Hey, hey, some of these treasure boxes
might have mirror shards in them!
   ▶Nanjo
The enemies here are strong.
▶Nanjo
If we don't equip ourselves well,
we won't have a prayer against Yuriko.
  ▶Brown
Cerberus was right... this Tartarus place
sure is exhausting...
▶Elly
Checking every single treasure box may
strain our time limitations.
 > Open the box? 
 > Obtained Ẅ♀|ԍMirror Shard| .
> You decide not to open the treasure box.
> The treasure box is already empty.▶Yukino
There's no end to this.
▶Yukino
The clock's ticking. If we don't stop this
at some point, we might be in trouble.
▶Ayase
Just being around treasure boxes makes me,
like, totally happy!
▶Nanjo
After so many battles together, I have a
higher opinion of you. You're strong.
▶Nanjo
Anyway... I'm only putting out feelers,
but once we defeat the Snow Queen...
▶Nanjo
Would you mind coming along to rescue
Masao? More manpower can hardly hurt.
▶Nanjo
I won't force you... just consider it.
 ▶Brown
Treasure boxes! What could be greater!?
Man! Treasure boxes!
▶Brown
Everyone knows what they are, but how
many have actually touched a real one!?
 ▶Elly
Please do keep our time limitations
in mind.
> Open the box? 
 > Obtained Ẅ♀|ԍMirror Shard| .
> You decide not to open the treasure box.
> The treasure box is already empty.▶Yukino
I hope Ms. Saeko's okay... Dammit...
We need to hurry this up.
▶Ayase
This totally sucks! What am I gonna do
without a Persona!?
 ▶Nanjo
We never previously realized the existence
of Personas...
▶Nanjo
But I now realize how taxing it can be
when one suddenly loses it.
   ▶Brown
Damn! Fighting without a Persona?
▶Brown
This tower has really strong monsters
in it, too! This is no joke!
   ▶Elly
It seems that if you transgress in some
way while in this tower...
▶Elly
There is a rule that you will pay with
your "life."
▶Elly
But in our case, it seems we'll lose our
Personas instead of our lives.▶Yukino
Not that it matters, but the treasure
boxes in this tower are shaped funny.
   ▶Ayase
I'm hungry... Do any of these treasure
boxes have, like, food in 'em?
  ▶Nanjo
Supplies are only meaningful if you put
them to use.
▶Nanjo
We must take care to ensure that they
don't end up being useless.
 ▶Brown
Even if we had more time, it still
wouldn't be enough.
▶Brown
This "Eternal Night" thingy could happen
any second... What a drag.
 ▶Elly
Eternal Night...
▶Elly
What would that world be like? Despite my
curiosity, I dread it...▶Agastya Tree
Ah. It seems that you are rather
exhausted, young ones.
▶Agastya Tree
Halting your journey here to rest for
the time being may be a wise decision.
▶Agastya Tree
But I cannot inscribe your story
onto myself.
▶Agastya Tree
I am only keeping it for your sake until
you depart again... Do not forget that...
  ▶Agastya Tree
Will you put a temporary halt to
your journey? 
▶Agastya Tree
Young ones... I will remember the story
of your journey for you.
▶Agastya Tree
Take care on your journey, young ones...▶Agastya Tree
Young ones... Your presence is welcome.
 ▶Agastya Tree

   ▶Agastya Tree

My name is Igor... I am delighted to
make your acquaintance.
▶Igor
This place exists between dream and
reality, mind and matter...
▶Igor
It's been quite some time since we last
had a guest.
▶Igor
This is a room that only those bound by
a "contract" may enter...
▶Igor
From this day forth, you will be our
guest in this Velvet Room.
▶Igor
Your destiny will require you to hone
your power...
▶Igor
And for that, you will inevitably
require our help.
▶Igor
The Velvet Room is also known as the
room of Personas.
▶Igor
A Persona is a side of you that shows
itself when you face the world...
▶Igor
Think of it as a facade of protection
you wear to face hardships in life.
▶Igor
Hm... Perhaps that may have been rather
difficult to understand...
▶Igor
To battle opponents that cannot be
dealt with by human strength alone...
▶Igor
We in this room will lend you inhuman
power... The power of demons...
▶Igor
Now then. Allow me to explain my role
here...
▶Igor
I will assist you in giving birth to
new Personas.
▶Igor
The demons contained within the |ԏspell
cards|  you hold will be fused as one...
▶Igor
Thereby creating a new Persona.
▶Igor
Should you find yourselves with these
cards, please do bring them here.
  ▶Igor
Welcome to the Velvet Room...
   ▶Igor
What is it you desire?
▶Igor
Well then, what would you like
to know?Ԡ
   ▶Igor
I'm afraid you don't have enough |ԏspell
cards|  to give birth to a new Persona.
▶Igor
Alas, we cannot look after any more
Personas.
   ▶Igor
What would you like to do?Ԟ
▶Igor
Well then... Farewell...
▶Igor
If it's new Personas you want, I shall
fuse and create them for you.
▶Igor
First, though, I must summon demons to
fuse together into a Persona.
▶Igor
And for that, a certain type of card
is necessary.
▶Igor
You see, these cards are inscribed with
demon-summoning spells.
▶Igor
They are known as spell cards, and all
demons carry one.
▶Igor
Thus, in order to perform a fusion, I
will need you to gather spell cards.
▶Igor
Go forth, negotiate with demons,
and bring these spell cards back here.
▶Igor
Combat is not the only way to deal
with demons... Do you understand?
▶Igor
And not all demons are necessarily
wishing for a fight...
 ▶Igor
It isn't enough merely to fuse a new
Persona in order to make it your own...
▶Igor
There is rather more to it than that,
I'm afraid.
▶Igor
You must take a Persona onto yourself
in order to use its power.
▶Igor
Each of you is capable of holding up
to three Personas.
▶Igor
A newly-fused Persona will be entrusted
into my care.
▶Igor
By all means let me know when you
would like to take on new Personas.
▶Igor
But I can only look after 16 Personas
at a time, mind you.
▶Igor
There are as many Personas as there are
personalities... an infinite variety.
▶Igor
Each has its own form and substance,
to be used according to the situation.
▶Igor
If you can master that principle,
you will make a fine Persona-user.
▶Igor
Each of you can take on as many as
three Personas at once.
▶Igor
Of the three, only one can be actively
invoked during battle.
▶Igor
To invoke a Persona is to summon it
in combat.
▶Igor
The remaining two will remain on
standby...
▶Igor
Ready to be assumed at any time
during battle.
▶Igor
Different active Personas will grant
you different abilities.
▶Igor
Without the power of Persona, you are
no different than an ordinary human...
▶Igor
You will be powerless before the arcane
might of the demons' spells.
▶Igor
If by chance you were hit by a spell in
that state, you would be struck down.
▶Igor
But by taking on a Persona, your defense
against spells is considerably enhanced.
▶Igor
For some, it may also confer strength,
or increase luck for others.
▶Igor
This, too, is the power of Persona.
▶Igor
Though they are called Personas, each
is a hidden side of yourself.
▶Igor
I suggest you examine your status
carefully after assuming one.
▶Igor
That way, you can see which of your
qualities have changed.
▶Igor
At first, you will be unable to harness
your Persona's powers to the fullest.
▶Igor
But the more you invoke a Persona,
the more powers it will grant you.
▶Igor
As your Persona learns new skills, you
will have more options in battle.
▶Igor
Even if your Persona learns a powerful
skill, the SP required remains constant.
▶Igor
You will grow in combat, but do not
forget that your Personas grow as well.
▶Igor
Pardon me for being nosy, but...
▶Igor
Personas have eight levels of growth.
You should try to develop them fully.
▶Igor
I'm sure that there will be an ample
reward for doing so...
▶Igor

Persona. And one more thing...
▶Igor

fusion to trigger a change.
▶Igor
There are some items for which the
result is easily predictable...
▶Igor
But sometimes, even I will be unable
to guess at what may happen.
▶Igor
Should that come about, I do hope that
you'll pardon me.
▶Igor
But make no mistake, I do believe it
is worth trying...
▶Igor

or lower-ranked fusion within an order.
