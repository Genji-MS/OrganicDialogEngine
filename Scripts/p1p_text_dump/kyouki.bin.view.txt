彻 ⓐ츛Ԃ츛и츛ѡ츛  蛳 ।̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺I don't know what nerds like you talk
about, but it sounds kinda fun.
  You don't sound much like a high
schooler when you talk... You lyin'
about your age?
 You punk! You pullin' one over on me!?
Are ya!?
You seriously tryin' to talk me into
this? Lying only causes trouble, man!
Wanna know why?
Because liars get their tongues ripped
out by the law!
   Hyahahahaha! You need me? ME, you say!?
You think you could actually control me?
ME, <Name>?
  Sounds like you're pretty sure of
yourself! Better not let it go to your
head, or you'll regret it!
You think you could kill me!? Gahaha,
you couldn't handle it.
Hehehe! Time to see if the blood of
stupid humans runs as red as they say!
 What's that? You want me to kill you
first? Ha, my pleasure!
 I didn't do anything... C'mon, you're
fingerin' the wrong guy...
   I'm beggin' ya, lemme go. I've got a
wife and kid back home, and they're
starvin'.
   I don't know what nerds like you talk
about, but it sounds kinda fun.
  Bein' invited's fine and all, but are
you really a high school kid? You better
not be lyin' 'bout your age...
You punk! You pullin' one over on me!?
Are ya!?
You seriously tryin' to talk me into
this? Lying only causes trouble, man!
Wanna know why?
Because liars get their tongues ripped
out by the law!
   Where you plannin' on takin' me...?
Maybe it's best to steer clear of you...
   Oh, er, damn! I got errands to run. Man,
I almost forgot...
  That song is whack! Unless you're TRYING
to sound like a whale!
Damn, no need to go showin' off!
I'm SO sorry I'm tone-deaf, alright!?
   Y-You're good...
   Damn, are you part banshee!? S-Stop
it, please!
  Ah, my heart feels cleansed... Maybe
it's time to re-evalute my life...?
   Bravo! Oh, good for you!
 I don't know what chicks like you
talk about, but it sounds kinda fun.
 You don't sound much like a high
schooler when you talk... You lyin'
about your age?
 You tramp! You pullin' one over on me!?
Are ya!?
   You serious, girl? If it's a lie, you're
in deep shit!
Because liars get their tongues ripped
out by the law!
   Hyahahahaha! You need me? ME, you say!?
You think you could actually control me?
ME, <Name>, human?
   I'm the strongest, most popular demon
ever to cruise the streets! Don't front!
 Damn girl, what's with that? You ain't
got no pride left?
You gonna shank me when I turn my back?
That's scary! I'm gettin' the chills!
  Don't even bother. Nobody likes me
anyway. I bet YOU'RE more popular...
  Well, I'll be ruling this world pretty
soon... You can be my queen! Hahaha!
It's just what you'd think: Demons gotta
roll strong!
In other words, if you're a pansy, you
ain't a demon at all!
  I don't know what chicks like you
talk about, but it sounds kinda fun.
 You don't sound much like a high
schooler when you talk... You lyin'

Because liars get their tongues ripped

   I don't even know what you're saying,
but I'm pretty sweet huh!?
   You tryin' to sign me on to your
cause or somethin'? Whatever, you
just want my power, yeah?
 Don't be scared! I'm nice to the ladies!
   Fighting a chick is lame. Bring out
your boyfriend, I'll take him on!
I'm the strongest, most popular demon
ever to cruise the streets! Don't front!
 Damn girl, what's with that? You ain't
got no pride left?
Well, I'll be ruling this world pretty
soon... You can be my queen! Hahaha!

In other words, if you're a pansy, you
ain't a demon at all!
  Hyahaha! You hittin' on me? You've got
guts!
   What!? What the hell is up with this?
I feel all weird...
  Screw men! Er... You know!
 Shut the hell up! One more word outta
your mouth, and you're dead!
   Hey hey hey! That ain't funny...
Oh damn, those eyes mean business...
  I-I'm a guy...! You want some proof!?
Er... nevermind!
   You... You're pretty cute. Alright,
call me later.
 Sure thing...
A joke for the new age! You're a
funny guy!
Ah, an upcoming comedian, eh? So how's
life? Are ya eating well?
 ...What the hell!?
 You think you're funny? Well you're not!
 Wowww... Just wow...
   You're tryin' to make me laugh so I put
down my guard! That's low, man!
  Hahahaha! You know what's even funnier
than that? ...Your FACE!
I consider myself an upbeat guy, so I've
always wanted upbeat friends like you!
  Well, that's life. I may look pretty
chill, but I've had it rough...
   Hey, do humans really think they'd be
better off dead?
   That's stupid! You're dumber than a bag
of hammers!
If you've got time to talk about that,
read a book! You're way too low level!
Hyahaha! That's funny! But I prefer
talking like adults.
   Never imagined I'd be talking to humans!
Good thing I didn't have money on it!
   You a performer of some kind? Well,
you're funny anyway!
   That was so... What WAS that?
Why you little...! Don't screw with me!
Hey! Were you absent the day they
handed out brains!?
Yikes... What the hell was that...?
H-Hey, hold up... Did I do something to
you? I didn't, did I?
This ain't Akiba station! I take my cow
there a lot, but it's kinda far, y'know?
   Sweet! You're giving that to me for
free, yeah?
  You've been foolin' demons like that,
have ya!? Well this is MY territory!
 That ain't nearly blingin' enough for
me! You got better than that, right?
   You're not gonna say you're giving that
to me, are you?
You're a good guy. You should join my
posse!
 I don't know what nerds like you talk
about, but it sounds kinda fun.
  You don't sound much like a high
schooler when you talk... You lyin'
about your age?
 You punk! You pullin' one over on me!?
Are ya!?
Argh! This is way over my head! Just
tell me what you mean!
  Hyahahahaha! You need me? ME, you say!?
You think you could actually control me?
ME, <Name>?
  Sounds like you're pretty sure of
yourself! Better not let it go to your
head, or you'll regret it!

fingerin' the wrong guy...
   I'm beggin' ya, lemme go. I've got a
wife and kid back home, and they're
starvin'.
   Hmm... I'd heard you kids were getting
more conceited, but it's true.
  I'll teach ya some manners... Hahaha...
Gimme your hand!
 You're a dude! Quit yappin' on and on
like a chick!
You makin' fun of me!? I'll show you
what the difference is between us!
  Hey man, flattery won't get you anywhere
in life.
  You're one of those intellectuals,
aren't you...?
Hey hey, you're good! That was pretty
cool!
You're good. Maybe I should learn to
do that...
  You've got no rhythm! You suck!
What is THAT? Did your granddaddy teach
you to dance!?
   Ye-yah! My blood's burning! I'm gonna
see some blood tonight! Yeahhhh!
 I-I can dance too, y'know! Check this
out! JUMP, JUMP! ...Haha, I kid!
   Sounds like you're pretty sure of
yourself! Better not let it go to your
head, or you'll regret it!
You think you could kill me!? Gahaha,
you couldn't handle it.
Hehehe! Time to see if the blood of

fingerin' the wrong guy...
   I'm beggin' ya, lemme go. I've got a
wife and kid back home, and they're
starvin'.
   Oh, this scar? I got this from a fight
a few years back. Scars are a man's medal!
  Uh... Is there... something behind me?
   What, man!? You wanna get started!?
What's with those eyes!? You wanna take
this outside!?
   I know I'm cool, but your stare is
burnin' me up! I'm melting, man!
Your radar needs a tune-up. I don't
mess with men. Got it!?
  I don't know what nerds like you talk
about, but it sounds kinda fun.
  You don't sound much like a high
schooler when you talk... You lyin'
about your age?
 You punk! You pullin' one over on me!?
Are ya!?
That sounds like a false statement!
Lying only causes trouble, man!
Wanna know why?
Because liars get their tongues ripped
out by the law!
  I have no clue what you're saying, but
I'm havin' fun!
 You on a mission or something?
Whatever, you just want my power anyway.
  You call that scary!? Humans are such
wusses! You know that, girl!?
Screw that! Let's make it scarier! You
play the chick who gets killed by the
demons!
 Umm... Wh-Where's the restroom? H-Hurry,
or I won't make it in time...
 H-Heh... That's all made up, right?
H-How stupid...
  Gore, screams, fear! I like it! Yeahhh!
That's interesting! Do humans fear me
like that too?
 Damnnnn, nice voice!
   You wanna do a duet? I'd be cool with
that!
  That song is whack! Unless you're TRYING
to sound like a whale!
Damn, no need to go showin' off!
I'm SO sorry I'm tone-deaf, alright!?
   Ah, my heart feels cleansed... Maybe
it's time to re-evalute my life...?
   Bravo! Oh, good for you!
 Whoa... You totally blew my mind. Was
that even a negotiation technique?
   ...Do I look like a minor?
   What was that!? You better shut your
mouth!
I'm about to beat some sense into you!
This may hurt, but you'll live... Maybe!
  Hey, hey... Man, this is a crazy
predicament...
Please, just for a little while... Hold
me against your chest!
   I don't know what chicks like you talk
about, but it sounds kinda fun.
 Bein' invited's fine and all, but are
you really a high school kid? You better
not be lyin' 'bout your age...
You punk! You pullin' one over on me!?
Are ya!?
You seriously tryin' to talk me into
this? Lying only causes trouble, man!

  I'll teach ya some manners... Hahaha...
Gimme your hand!
 What was that!? You better shut your
mouth!
I'm about to beat some sense into you!
This may hurt, but you'll live... Maybe!
  Th-That's kinda cruel... What'd I ever
do to you?
  Look... If you weren't so young,
talking big like that wouldn't slide...
 Hyahahaha! You tryin' to tempt me!?
You got guts!
  What!? What the hell is up with this?
I feel all weird...
  I hate live women! I'm serious here...
That sucked!
Hehehehe... Then c'mere, girl!
   *whistle* Really!? Damn, I'm so popular!
It ain't easy bein' a player, y'know!
 My baby doll! Jump into my arms!
 To tell ya the truth... I've got kind
of a soft spot for that stuff...
 Okay, okay, I won't hurt you. I promise.
Just stop crying...
 Oh dammit... I made her cry! God damn it!
  You heartless witch! Using my soft
spot for... Aghhh, that's so low!
 It wasn't me! I didn't do anything!
She just started crying on her own!
Damn... I don't know what to do...
Never thought I'd make a girl cry...
  Sounds like you're pretty sure of
yourself! Better not let it go to your
head, or you'll regret it!
You think you could get me!? Gahaha,
you couldn't handle it.
 Hehehe! Time to see if the blood of

   What was that!? You better shut your
mouth!
I'm about to beat some sense into you!
This may hurt, but you'll live... Maybe!
  ...I-I'm sorry...
  You're strong for a chick... But uh,
Missy? Lay off picking on the weak, eh?
 You're nice and healthy. I've lost my
energy... It sucks... Heh, except that
I'm totally lying.
Th-This feeling...I can't contain it!
Do some more!
  I don't know what nerds like you talk
about, but it sounds kinda fun.
  You don't sound much like a high
schooler when you talk... You lyin'
about your age?
 You punk! You pullin' one over on me!?
Are ya!?
You tryin' to preach to me, lady!?
Don't you dare go big sister on me!
   Hyahahahaha! You need me? ME, you say!?
You think you're the pope or somethin'?
Whatever, you just want my power, right?
 What was that!? You better shut your
mouth!
I'm about to beat some sense into you!
This may hurt, but you'll live... Maybe!

I'm totally lying.
Th-This feeling...I can't contain it!
Do some more!
  You've got the look of someone tryin'
not to be scared! Hehehehe!
  Hmm, you're crazy to ignore me! You're
not afraid of the consequences?
   Tch, what a snob! You sayin' I'm not
even worth negotiating with!?
 If a man wounds my pride, I wound the
man by staining the floor with his 
blood! That's what manhood is about!
   Did I make you angry or something...?
  Why you so down? I don't know what
happened, but cheer up, okay?
 You've got the look of someone tryin'

   Quit your yellin'! If you're screwin'
with me, you'll be sorry!
Hey! Were you absent the day they
handed out brains!?
Yikes... What the hell was that...?
H-Hey, hold up... Did I do something to
you? I didn't, did I?
Hyahahahahaha! You got guts!
   Damn you! You're just my type!
   Hey, you know magic? You're cool, guy!
 I see... You think you can impress the
ladies with that, huh!?
   Humans can use magic...? They didn't
teach us that...
  Yo, bro... C'mon, let's be friends...
You wouldn't make a friend disappear,
would ya?
C-Can you make money appear!? You're
awesome! Damn, I think I'm in love!
   Hey! If I put you in a chained up box
and submerged it, could you escape?
Argh! This can't be! You're making me
smarter!
 You're doing all this by the book...
Can't you be more interesting!?
   What, what, what!? You want me to listen
to you? Then hand something over!
That was stupid, but I listened all the
way through. You don't wanna leave this
world with something left to say, huh?
 Would you shut the hell up!? Listening
to you talk is makin' me wanna puke!
Cut the crap! Out with it already!
What good is telling me that...?
   Oh, sorry... I nodded off for a second
there...
You a talk show host or something?
Today's guest is... <Name>!
  Hyahahaha! You're a smooth talker!
You sly dog, you!
   Personally, I like this conversation!
Just a little more, you can do it!
  You've got good eyes man! I'm totally
incredible, after all! Couldn't tell you
why, I just am!
 You're blunt, huh!? Nice and simple!
   What, what, what!? You want me to listen
to you? Then hand something over!
To put it in simple terms... NO!
Now, in simpler terms, give me
something!
   This is boring as hell! I deserve a
way better negotiation than this!
  Who'd listen to your request!?
 Something smells here... I'm gonna open
this carefully...
  I could help you, but there's nothing
in it for me...
  Oh, sorry... I nodded off for a second
there...
Hyahahaha! I'm too damn irresistible!
  It's nice to come through for somebody,
but it's tough sometimes! Really!
  I wouldn't mind helping you out! Give
me a little more, though! You can do it!
So that's gonna be your attitude, huh?
I don't get you. Not that I get me...
   Huh? ...Am I supposed to be happy or
sad?
  I don't care if you make fun of me!
Just gimme the goods!
A badass gets the goods no matter what!
So hand 'em over!
  Huh!? You must be ready to die!
You just made the top of my "to die"
list!
 With an attitude like that, you must
want me to kill you, huh!?
Not that you stand a chance, so you
better listen to orders!
 Why you... Don't you know the difference
between a good idea and a bad one?
*sniff* What an attitude...*sniff*
...I'm not crying! It's sweat...
I ain't gonna get worked up over some
punk kids...
 That's a hell of an attitude! Whatever,
I prefer that to emo kids.
 Taunt me all you want, you can't crack
me!
I'm the epitome of perfect!
According to my horoscope, I need to
avoid being short-tempered. So I'm
gonna let you off the hook... once!
So ya wanna be an entertainer? Well then
what are you hanging around here for?
 No, no... You think too much! You gotta
go with your gut.
  Uh... Shouldn't your act be something
people would actually pay to see?
   Do something interesting!
  That sucks... It sucks, man!
   My time is precious, and you're wasting
it with this crap!
You better pay me back, pronto!
   Who do you think I am...? You better
get serious here!
 D-Did you die of fear?
 I'm jealous... You've got nerves of
steel...
   Maybe I should learn a trick or two.
   Hyhahahaha! That was cool! I feel
like drinking...
 I'm not interested, actually... But I
feel sorry for ya, so I'll hang around
a little longer!
  There's no guarantee this ain't a
trap... Tough call...
I can't give you the nod for this!
How 'bout a little more?
   You shouldn't mess with adults!
You think I'd backstab my homies for
that!? You're an idiot!
   I'll give you something, but I ain't
gonna hand you my spell card. That's
just how it is.
 You mistook me for a girl just because
I've got a beautiful face...? Damn...
   Sorry, bud! I'm just not in the mood...
Maybe next time...
 H-Hold up! Wait, man! I ain't ready yet!
   Hyahaha! Everyone's nuts about me!
 Don't put me on the spot like that...
But I guess I won't turn down kindness,
so I'll take something!
 You're better than a buncha demons...
Maybe I'll go with you...
Makin' threats, calmin' 'em down...
you've got your work cut out for you...
I know cute when I see it, and I'm
seeing it, so I'll let it slide!
Heh, scared of me, huh? Good! Bow
before me! Beg for mercy!
Hey! You think you kids can handle a
negotiation with me!?
 Words are empty, man. Wouldn't you
agree?
 I don't have a freakin' clue what's
going on in that head of yours...
  O-Okay... You're angry, aren't you?
C'mon, talk with a little emotion...
   It's alright, I don't harm ladies. I'm
a feminist, y'know!
 Damn, I'm bigger than I thought!
   You look nice and soft... But I think
you should put on s'more meat!
   What the hell!? You've already got my
spell card! You don't need two! Heh!
 Oh well. I'll give this to ya!
 Tch, that so!?
 Looks like we aren't hitting it off.
Oh well.
  Huh!? You!? Am I hearing things!? You're
way too weak!
 Oh well. I guess I'll toss ya this as a
parting gift.
  I'm gonna eat you one of these days...
So don't let any other demons sink their
teeth into ya until then!
  I'll give ya this. It's been nice
workin' with ya!
 *sigh* If I stick around any longer,
I think I'll get moldy. I'm out!
  You don't get it! I don't need no
brats! Fuse me with the hotties!
 ...I know! Take this! That'll make you
happy, right? Right? So c'mon, lemme go!
You're so slow, I'm growin' mold, man!
 I'll give ya this. Now scram! Hyahaha!
 What should I do...? I can't decide!
Damn, is my brain this weak!?
 Argh, I don't get it! You want a card,
right? Here, take it!
   Well, I ain't much for talkin', so I
guess I'll just say I wanna help you.
 If it's my card ya want, it's yours!
Now you can't lose! Hyaha!
Damn it, I don't wanna fight you!
  Here, a present for ya. I must be
goin' soft, but take it!
 Oh yeah! You want my card, don'tcha?
   What if you kill me the second I give
it to you? Yeah...
   Hehe! Humans, humans, and more humans!
What're ya doin' here, fellas?
   You're a crazy guy to negotiate with
demons...
 Well, I'd say our meeting here musta
been fate. Give me somethin' to remember
today by!
   Hey, you! You're in my way!
  What the hell!? Who said you could talk
to me? I'm just passin' by!
Look, if you wanna pass, you gotta
pay the toll. That's how it works!
 If you get near me, I ain't responsible
for any injuries you get...
  Ugh, you guys... Shoulda known it was
a bad day when my shoelaces snapped...
   There's no way humans could ever beat a
demon! ...'Course, that's just popular
opinion...
  Hey, what's all the fuss about? Some
kinda concert going on?
 You answered! I must be world famous,
man!
 Heh, I haven't talked to too many
humans, so... I'm kinda nervous...
   I don't expect an answer, but I've
gotta ask anyway...
Don't you have anything better to do?
   Let's get this straight! Do you got
some business with me, or are you here
to hang out!?
  If ya gave me something, maybe I'd be
willing to listen!
 You don't really have business with me,
do ya? I'm shovin' off then...
  Oh great, a human! *sigh* Of all the
luck...
I always find the troublemakers. Even
in my love life...
Let's make one thing clear: no violence.
I'll uphold my end.
  To tell ya the truth, my heart's racing.
Man, I'm ready to wreak havoc!
 Y'know, I feel like the two of us may
have been separated at birth!
   I love humans, but y'know, we can't
keep this up forever...
   Y-You're a spy, aren't you!? You can't
fool me, spy!
Listen, it wasn't me, man! C'mon, just
lemme go...
...! I am your grandpa... Thank you for
summoning me from beyond...
Fighting is not the answer... You
mustn't kill demons... Eh!? Did I just
say something?
  You really think you can change anything
with your power alone?
 You don't comprehend my greatness! To
fight me would be like a slingshot
against a tank!
  I'm gonna be king of the world! I'd
stay off my bad side if I were you!
  What're you planning to do with me!?
That...!? Or... this!?
 What's this? My heart wants to leap
outta my chest...
 Yes, hurt me moooooooooore!
   ...So what're ya saying?
   You've pissed me off, and the punishment
for that is death. Time to pay up!
Wh-What? You hate me, don't you?
   ...I don't feel like you and me are
strangers. Can I call you brother?
 How long are you plannin' on tyin' me
up? If you've got business, out with it!
 I'm willing to hear ya out. So put away
those shiny things, alright?
   I like the smell of blood I'm sniffing!
I'll listen to ya!
 ...I can't take it anymore! Someone!
Help me! These guys are whack!
I smell blood from over there! It smells
way more interesting than here!
   If I cut my stomach out, would you eat
it? I'd eat yours...
I'm short on cash! Gimme ᄁ<Amount>!
   ...Thanks, man!
What the hell!? Think you can trick me!?
   What the hell!? You think you're funny,
tellin' me you have it when you don't!?
This ain't a request, it's an order!
   You don't get it, man... Save all the
money you want, but once you're dead,
it won't do you much good.
 I'll settle for one life stone!
You've got more than I thought! ...Now
I don't feel like I've got enough.
  Hey hey hey! Gimme a break! This is BS!
You little...! You better not be lyin'!
Excuse me? I must not have heard that
right, because I believe you just told
me "no"!
  Huh? If you want me to get angry, I can do
that for ya!
...Well damn, it's not like someone's
forcing you to give it to me!
   Well, lookee here! It's a pretty stone!
Tch! Talking to you is a damn waste!
   Desire can kill ya if you've got too
much of it!
   Well, I did say you didn't have to if ya
didn't want to, but...
If you let me take some of your life,
I'll feel a little better!
   There there, kid. I'll make this as
painless as possible!
  Well then, kid, prepare to be punished!
Denied!? But I'm feeling kinda low!
Now I really feel like taking life!
You got a lotta guts lyin' to me! When
did you grow a pair?
No way, seriously? You're pretty old
fashioned for a high schooler!
I got it, I got it. You can finish your
conversation in hell.
  Pretty honest, eh? Where I come from,
honesty doesn't always pay.
  Stick your tongue out then! I'll pull
it out quick!
Now you're all confident? That's fishy.
You're up to something, aren't you!?
   Oh well. Guess I'll take care of the
kids!
 Well, that's kids for ya!
  That so...? Let's test it out!
 Heh, pretty confident, aren't ya!? Heh!
Not bad!
   Well, duh! If you get it now, time to
improve this negotiation!
Oh really? Then gimme a back massage
and bring me something to drink!
  Ooh, now we're talking. Why can't kids
be more like that?
  Ooh, now we're talking. Makes it easier
to kill ya!
It's worse than that... Listen, don't
ever tie the knot, man!
  Whaddaya mean, "what!?" It's important
to me! You wouldn't understand!
 You got a lotta guts lyin' to me! When
did you grow a pair?
No way, seriously? You're pretty old
fashioned for a high schooler!
I got it, I got it. You can finish your
conversation in hell.
  Pretty honest, eh? Where I come from,
honesty doesn't always pay.
  Stick your tongue out then! I'll pull
it out quick!
Oh, er... Um... I don't have time to...
Ugh, this guy ain't even listening...
  An errand is an errand, man! Don't be
talkin' like some nosy old lady!
 I don't need comforting, dammit! I'll
make sure you never sing again!
  Huh!? I hope you enjoyed saying that to
my face, because after I crush your
throat, you won't speak again!
 Hey man, I was tryin' to be a better
dude too...
   What're you doing!? That attack was
freakin' inhumane!
 Ahh... I can see a flower field in the
distance...
 Encore! Encore!
If I made you my slave, I could hear
that song whenever I wanted! Damn, I'm
a genius!
But...I 'm a nice guy, so I'll take
something instead.
 Wait a sec... If I keep listening, am
I gonna get sucked in by the spell?
  You got a lotta guts lyin' to me! When
did you grow a pair?
Gimme a break, bud! You're pretty old
fashioned for a high schooler!
   I got it, I got it. You can finish your
conversation in hell.
  Pretty honest, eh? Where I come from,
honesty doesn't always pay.
  Stick your tongue out then! I'll pull
it out quick!
Now you're all confident? That's fishy.
You're up to something, aren't you!?
   Oh well. Guess I'll take care of the
kids!
 Well, that's kids for ya!
  So you threw away your pride for that?
You must have some deeper reason...
 Hehehe... Then you don't mind what
happens to you, huh!? Hehehe!
   Don't get all arrogant, damn it!
   ...I understand, but it still pisses me
off!
   Well, yeah! I asked the obvious. So I
guess I'm asking for something!
 That so? Maybe I'm not that bad after
all!
 Don't talk like you know! Humans don't
need weak-ass guys like you either!
 Right? Humanity doesn't need weak-ass
guys either!
 Hey hey, that's common knowledge, lady.
Lemme put it this way...
If an insect says its a demon, you'd
crush it all the same, right?
   You got a lotta guts lyin' to me! When
did you grow a pair?
Gimme a break, bud! You're pretty old
fashioned for a high schooler!
   I got it, I got it. You can finish your
conversation in hell.
  Pretty honest, eh? Where I come from,
honesty doesn't always pay.
  Stick your tongue out then! I'll pull
it out quick!
Oh well. Guess I'll take care of the
kids!
 Haha, no need to lie! Sticking to your
plans is important!
 My rage just hit 11 on the 10-point
scale, bro! Time to kill some people!
  Heh, you're on! I'll crush you!
You're a girl... I don't like how guilty
that makes me feel about this...
  Eh, don't sweat it. Just gimme something
and we'll be cool.
   So you threw away your pride for that?
You must have some deeper reason...
 Hehehe... Then you don't mind what
happens to you, huh!? Hehehe!
   Don't get all arrogant, damn it!
   Don't talk like you know! Humans don't
need weak-ass guys like you either!
 Right? Humanity doesn't need weak-ass
guys either!
 Hey hey, that's common knowledge, lady.
Lemme put it this way...
If an insect says its a demon, you'd
crush it all the same, right?
   Arrrgh! This isn't good!
   I-It's really okay to destroy them...?
No... I don't want to...
Huh? Well, I can't tell you that!
  Agh, stop it! Don't come any closer!
   Ahh! ...Don't startle me! That pisses
me off!
  Ahh! ...Don't startle me like that...
  No, thank you for being born for the
sole purpose of meeting me here!
  What the hell!? Be clear about what
you--Ugh, forget it!
   Sometimes you've gotta be decisive! So
let's go! We'll hit up worlds you
never knew existed!
   Hey, have you been eating better than
me!? Whatever, I'll rip it outta your
stomach!
   Huh? If you keep crying, I'm gonna
throw some salt on the wound.
  A bad comedian can't just apologize on
stage and expect to be forgiven!
Well, at least you've got the pride of
an entertainer. That's commendable!
 Don't try to play it off! I... I won't
be f-fooled...
  ...Which means... Uh oh...
 See!? The great <Name> knows all!
   We're already buddies, right? We
should go rob someone!
But first... I should practice on you!
   We're already buddies, right? We
should go rob someone!
Tch, why would I want a punk like you
anyway!?
 If you're gonna do that, you may as well
be lunch for me, man! Don't waste food!
   Dumbass, fools like you don't need to
bother!
  Huh? What am I reading? Haven't you
ever seen a comic book before!?
Huh? What am I reading? Haven't you
ever seen a comic book before!?
Alright, I'll lecture you on Japanese
literature then! I recommend Kawabata
or Akutagawa! They're like... art!
 I'm such a sinful demon, trying to eat
a good guy like you... Geheheh!
 C'mon... That's not what you do when
someone opens their heart to you...
   C'mon... That's not what you do when
someone opens their heart to you!
 If it's a joke, I'm supposed to laugh!
Hyahahahaha! Haah hha!
   Oooh, a joke... Hmm... Huh...
  Tch! How boring! What a poseur...!
 Shut up, shut up! I hate dudes who can't
even make a decision!
 Gyahaha! You really are whacked out!
   Gyahaha! You really are whack! ...
Maybe I'll join you! Grr... RAAHHHH!
What...? Why are you laughing!? Aagh!
Whyyyyy!?
You wanna take me on, eh!? It's kill or
be killed...! Er... Not that I like
those odds...
  If you're up to it, that makes things
easier. Whoever wins is right!
   Ooh, you're a stand-up guy! I'm pretty
stoked.
 That's it! Hand it over right now!
I said, hand it over!
   What!? You're tryin' to sell it to me!?
You're in deep trouble if you're tryin'
to haggle with demons!
 I use only the best!
   So you're not gonna give it to me, eh!?
Now I'm pissed! You better not
underestimate my rage!
  You were just trying to save face, huh?
No worries! It'll be our little secret!
First, bring me a soul. We'll split it
70:30!
Ha! But you humans can't DO that, can
ya!? You'd never make it in my crew!
  So there's something to this, huh?
Damn, bein' greedy can be dangerous...
  Oh come on, man, don't turn everything
into a joke! Take it seriously for once!
You got a lotta guts lyin' to me! When
did you grow a pair?
Gimme a break, bud! You're pretty old
fashioned for a high schooler!
   That's really makin' me wonder, kid!
   "Ha..." My ass! You wanna get choked!?
 Are you laughing...? This doesn't sound
so good...
 Now you're all confident? That's fishy.
You're up to something, aren't you!?
   Oh well. Guess I'll take care of the
kids!
 Well, that's kids for ya!
  That so...? Let's test it out!
 Heh! Confident, aren't ya!? Not bad!
   Well, duh! If you get it now, time to
improve this negotiation!
Then I'll take something from ya!
I know it's outta the blue, but don't
sweat it!
 Ooh, now we're talking. Why can't kids
be more like that?
  Ooh, now we're talking. Makes it easier
to kill ya!
It's worse than that... Listen, don't
ever tie the knot, man!
  Whaddaya mean, stupid!? It's important,
man! You just don't get it!
Wha... What's with those puppy-dog
eyes!? That was a lie... I feel so
defiled...
   Haha, an attitude like that only makes
me more interested.
 That's too bad! Sometimes they call me
the gentleman of the demon world!
   Hahaha! Alright, leave it to me!
   Tch! Like it'd go that smoothly, you
little punk!
  Tch... Apologizing so quickly takes all
the fun outta it...
Wow! I like arrogant pricks like you!
  Ha, you can't step to me! I'm the master
of the times tables, y'know!
  Hahaha! That's right! I'm stupid!
  Dancing's great, isn't it!? Gets me
all excited!
   Then never mind...
 Don't look down on me! I can do anything
I set my mind to!
 So you think I can't dance, huh!?
Don't mess with me, punk!
What ya need is a good party dance!
That's what I'm talkin' about! Hahaha!
 That's... a dance...? I don't understand
human tastes sometimes...
 Oooh, ya like it, huh!? I've got talent,
huh!? HUH!?
   Oh, guess that's a no-go then... H-How
about the lambada...? No...?
Oh, guess that's a no-go then... How
about the lambada? C'mon!
 That so...? Let's test it out!
 Heh, pretty confident, aren't ya!? Heh!
Not bad!
   Well, duh! If you get it now, time to
improve this negotiation!
Then I'll take something from ya!
I know it's outta the blue, but don't
sweat it!
 Ooh, now we're talking. Why can't kids
be more like that?
  Ooh, now we're talking. Makes it easier
to kill ya!
It's worse than that... Listen, don't
ever tie the knot, man!
  Whaddaya mean, stupid!? It's important,
man! You just don't get it!
It was a bluff, huh? Well it's no fun
now that I know...
   What? What do I need? C'mon, please,
tell me!
  ...Me. *blush*
 Whoa, if a perfect guy like me has a
fault, you better tell me!
You don't gotta be so blunt...
 What fault do I have!? Like, am I a
loser demon, or is it just that I don't
make a big enough impact!?
 You get it now? Then hook me up with a
hottie!
 Huh? You're not fawning over me!? Tch!
 Heh, so little Mark is all grown-up
now, huh? Hahahaha!
Oh, nothing! I don't give a damn about
you!
But I'll take something from ya anyway!
  I got it, I got it. You can finish your
conversation in hell.
  Pretty honest, eh? Where I come from,
honesty doesn't always pay.
  Stick your tongue out then! I'll pull
it out quick!
Oh well. Guess I'll take care of the
kids!
 Haha, no need to lie! Sticking to your
plans is important!
 My rage just hit 11 on the 10-point
scale, bro! Time to kill some people!
  Which do you prefer? "The Tokyo Chainsaw
Massacre" or "Mummy Girl"?
Why, man...? You might become famous and
get your own movie!
   You don't get it! This is your chance
to be famous!
You could play the girl who dies in the
credits after the movie ends! ...Whoa.
How would that even work...?
   AHHHH! H-H-Help meeee, for the love of--
......Huh?
I thought so! I fear nothing!
  Yeah! YEAH! There's nothing the great
<Name> is afraid of!
  Wh-Why are you laughing!? You lied,
didn't you!?
   No way! I'm being laughed at...? Hey,
what's so funny about me...?
 I see, I see. Got any requests? I like
songs from "Demon School Musical" or
"The Killer Dance."
Anyway, did you forget the karaoke
machine? Hahaha! Lame!
 Who'd do a duet with a brat like you!?
 I don't need comforting, dammit! I'll
make sure you never sing again!
  Huh!? I hope you enjoyed saying that to
my face, because after I crush your
throat, you won't speak again!
 Hey man, I was tryin' to be a better
dude too...
   Encore! Encore!
If I made you my slave, I could hear
that song whenever I wanted! Damn, I'm
a genius!
But...I 'm a nice guy, so I'll take
something instead.
 Wait a sec... If I keep listening, am
I gonna get sucked in by the spell?
  Then I'll do something bad while I've
got the chance! Gimme something!
So you're saying I've got mature charm
just oozing out of me? Hehe, I like it!
 Yeah! I like honest kids!
  Hm... You wanna rumble? Well, I'm not
huge on violence, but...
 What a fool! Resisting is only gonna
make it hurt more, and I can prove it!
I've never felt so relaxed...
  Well, excuse me for bein' myself! No one
trusts me, so I don't trust anyone!
   You got a lotta guts lyin' to me! When
did you grow a pair?
No way! Seriously? You're one pretty
high schooler...
  I got it, I got it. You can finish your
conversation in hell.
  Pretty honest, eh? Where I come from,
honesty doesn't always pay.
  Stick your tongue out then! I'll pull
it out quick!
Now you're all confident? That's fishy.
You're up to something, aren't you!?
   Oh well. Guess I'll take care of the
kids!
 Well, that's kids for ya!

the gentleman of the demon world!
   Yeah! I like honest kids!
  Hm... You wanna rumble? Well, I'm not
huge on violence, but...!
What a fool! Resisting is only gonna
make it hurt more! Not that I care.
   Go ahead, boast all ya want. The more
shocked you are later, the funner it is
for me!
  Well, don't feel so down. If you sign
with me when you get older, I'll make
you young again!
I think I'll take an advance payment!
   ...Why are you so stupid? Take better
care of yourself!
Hey, you! You're not suspecting me, are
ya!?
   If you're gonna hesitate, don't go
through with it in the first place! Tch,
I knew it was too good to be true!
 Ooh, my darling! Don't worry! When we're
reborn, we'll live happily ever after!
Why!? I thought we were gonna do
something good! Hey! You tricked me!
  Is this a nightmare...? Naw... It's a
beautiful dream...
   That was a quick reversal... Hey, you
were faking your tears, weren't you!?
Just kidding! Damn, I wasn't sure I
could keep that up! Gave me goosebumps!
Whoa! Not bad! I like ya!
  Y-Y-You laughed, didn't you!? Damn it,
I'm gonna get you!
  You're shaking, man... What's wrong?
Are ya cold?
  Ugh, this is a pain in the ass! Maybe
I'll just tear you to shreds to get rid
of the evidence!
 What's with this chick? She's crazy...
 Hey, hey... You serious? C'mon, don't
scare me like that...
That so...? Let's test it out!
 Heh, pretty confident, aren't ya!? Heh!
Not bad!
   Well, duh! If you get it now, time to
improve this negotiation!
Then I'll take something from ya!
I know it's outta the blue, but don't
sweat it!
 Ooh, now we're talking. Why can't kids
be more like that?
  Ooh, now we're talking. Makes it easier
to kill ya!
Rough doesn't even begin to describe it.
Listen, make sure you marry rich!
 Whaddaya mean, stupid!? It's important,
man! You just don't get it!
Yeah! I like honest kids!
  Hm... You wanna rumble? Well, I'm not
huge on violence, but...
 What a fool! Resisting is only gonna
make it hurt more, and I can prove it!
Not good at all! I punish tramps like
you!
 That's right! It ain't good! You got
that? Then don't do it again.
 That's right! It's not good. But... you
knew... yet you... Why?
Oh!
Don't stop! Damn it, you can't just stop
in the middle! You'll pay for that!
   I see... Well, if you quit, then I'll
quit being in a good mood!
   You got a lotta guts lyin' to me! When
did you grow a pair?
Well, you'll have to excuse me for that,
buddy! But still, you're way mature for
a high school kid!
Ack... She's a real dominatrix...
  You tramp! Why you gotta rob me!?
  How do I put this...? Well... Are you
really trying to negotiate, or...
I don't get it...
  My rage just hit 11 on the 10-point
scale! Time to kill some people!
   Yeah! I like honest kids!
  Hm... You wanna rumble? Well, I'm not
huge on violence, but...
 What a fool! Resisting is only gonna
make it hurt more, and I can prove it!
Not good at all! I punish tramps like
you!
 That's right! It ain't good! You got
that? Then don't do it again.
 That's right! It's not good. But... you
knew... yet you... Why?
Oh!
Don't stop! Damn it, you can't just stop
in the middle! You'll pay for that!
   I see... Well, if you quit, then I'll
quit being in a good mood!
   I see... Then I'll have to show you
what it means to fear!
 Hmm, that's rare. So if I killed you,
maybe you'd be extinct.
  Acting all tough is no good! You ain't
a real human until you can admit you
have a weakness!
   ...It's all about playing it cool and
kind these days... My era is over...
 ...It's all about playing it cool and
kind these days... You agree, huh?
   Tch! You're not a man! But you ARE a
woman, huh!
   Hey, you're not scary. No real reason
to bother getting on your good side!
 Ugh... *cough*
 *sigh* You're like a little kid!
Grow up, man!
 I see... Then I'll have to show you
what it means to fear!
 Hmm, that's rare. So if I killed you,
maybe you'd be extinct.
  Acting all tough is no good! You ain't
a real human until you can admit you
have a weakness!
   ...It's all about playing it cool and
kind these days... My era is over...
 ...It's all about playing it cool and
kind these days... You see why that
sucks for me, right? So gimme somethin'!
Tch! You've got no manhood! What we
have here is a bonified drag queen!
Hey, you're not scary. No real reason
to bother getting on your good side!
 Ugh... *cough*
 *sigh* You're like a little kid!
Grow up, man!
 That so...? Let's test it out!
 Heh, pretty confident, aren't ya!? Heh!
Not bad!
   Well, I'll say it one more time then...
Hand something over!
  Then I'll take something from ya!
I know it's outta the blue, but don't
sweat it!
 Ooh, now we're talking. Why can't kids
be more like that?
  Ooh, now we're talking. Makes it easier
to kill ya!
It's worse than that... Listen, don't

  Whaddaya mean, stupid!? It's important,

Shut up, shut up! I hate dudes who can't

 Gyahaha! You really are whacked out!
   Gyahaha! You really are whack! ...
Maybe I'll join you! Grr... RAAHHHH!
What...? Why are you laughing!? Aagh!
Whyyyyy!?
You wanna take me on, eh!? It's kill or
be killed...! Er... Not that I like
those odds...
  If you're up to it, that makes things
easier. Whoever wins is right!
   Well, if you're happy, then I will be
too!
 Tch, of course it's a lie! Dumbass!
Do you really hate being liked by me
that much!?
   Hehehe! I get where you're coming from,
but... that's tacky!
   Dumbass! You're ten years too young to
be flirting!
You don't gotta hide it! Ask me about
men and women!
   Hey, I wasn't jokin'...
Then I'll make you disappear before you
can do the same to me!
 Phew... Don't throw me off like that,
bro...
   You're awesome! Next time, do it for me!
   Try it, then! ...C'mon, what's wrong?
I said do it!
Heh, what a cheap trick! Hehehe... Now
hand something over!
   You make it look like you're "scouting,"
but you just wanna catch demons and
work 'em to the bone, huh!?
   Alright... What genius gave this guy a
knife!? He's not all there...
   Then why do you have the aura of a
killer all around you? You're funky!
Whaddaya mean, "where?" There! Oh...
Here? Damn it, I'm lost!
  Never thought I'd run into someone who'd
talk to me like that...I don't really
know how to feel about this...
  If sorry cut it, we wouldn't need jails,
would we!? That's what all the humans say,
am I right!?
   You don't care, eh? Honest humans get
treated better!
  See? You'd have a problem, right? So
now do you see why you should stay out
of my way?
 Th-There's n-n-no point in trying to
s-s-s-scare me...
 Huh? There really is!? Well, if you
insist, I'll go...
 Hahaha, well, yeah! I know there's no
such place, but it still pisses me off!
  Hahaha, well, yeah! There's no such
place! Duhhh!
  Listen here, ya cheap bastard, if
there's nothing there, you're dead!
  As long as there're humans like you,
the demon business is safe! Thanks, man!
  Don't think, act! Kids are all talk
these days!
Whaddaya want me to do? Help you pick
up cans to recycle? Sorry, but I'm a
bad guy!
Oh really? Well, if it's for your sake,
sure.
  Oh really... Well... If it's for your
sake, I guess...
 ...Ugh, whaddaya mean, "why?"
  Oh, that's kinda cool! I'll copy you!
  Hey, sounds good! Let's destroy the
world, then we'll...! Huh? No?
 Why ya gotta put it that way...?
Th-That's cold!
   Why ya gotta be all cold!? You don't
get demons at all!
What, are you worried about me? Damn,
man... I'm touched...
I-I knew it! You're gonna shut me up!
I'll be killed or locked away forever!
   That was a joke? C'mon, <Name>,
if ya don't laugh, they'll kill ya...
   Hyahaha! Good one! But I ain't gonna
be fooled!
Ha, brings back memories. I was kinda
like that once... Maybe I should relive
those days!
  So it's something you've gotta do, even
if you don't believe in it. Hm. I see...
   You don't know? How am I supposed to let
a fool like you control me!?
  Arrgggh! Wh-What are you doing!? You're
inhumane! Ohhh, s-stop it...
   S-Seriously!? Hey man, no jokes!
You sure it's okay!?
  Hmmm... I'm kinda happy, but sad at
the same time... It's complicated...
   Hmmm... I'm kinda happy, but sad at
