彻 Ԃ ż ૡ ઢ   蛳 ɀ̺̺Hyuk hyuk! I like the way you talk,
mister.
It makes me wanna listen more. No lie!
  Uuuurgh! That's not what I wanna hear!
 Ooohehehe! You need me? A ฬ?
 You're trying to taunt me like that...?
Hyuk hyuk! You're funny, mister!
  Uuurrrrgh! You wanna fight!?
 Hyuk... Wh-What did I do...?
   Hyuk hyuk! I think I'm starting to
believe what you say...
 It's not easy to pick me up, you know!
I'm not a cheap ฬ!
  Hyuk... Your face is scary when you talk
to me, mister...
Uuuurrrgh! My brain is rotting!
I hate stuff that rots!
Hyuk... Your throat's all messed up,
mister...
 Ooohehehe! You rock, mister! Encore!
Encore! Sing another song!
  Why are you so desperate? Hyuk hyuk
hyuk hyuk!
 No way!
You need me? Really? Yaaaaaay!
I'm so happy!
   Uuuurrrgh! I won't fall for your
sweet talk, lady!
 Eep... M-Miss... Are you scheming
something...?
  Ooohehehe! You really know how it feels
to be a ฬ, lady.
Maybe you're a ghost too?
Hyuk hyuk! You say some funny things
sometimes, lady!
How do you come up with your jokes?
   There's no way that's true! You must be
dumb! Stupidhead!
  Ooohehehe! I always knew it! I just
had that feeling...
Hyuk hyuk! Why are you so scared?
  Uuuurrrrgh! You're even noisier than me!
   Ooohehehe! I'm scary! Rarrr!
Ooohee
   Hyuk hyuk! Mister, are you... an idiot?
Are you? Huh?
How dumb can you be, hitting on me?
Stupidhead! You're hopeless!
Uuuurrrrgh! I'm a BOY! Don't mess with
me, or I'll cut you!
  Eeep... You're kidding, right...?
Could you say that stuff to Silvie
instead of me...?
อ   Ooohehehe! Good eye, mister!
There's no ฬ cuter
than us!
  Hyuk hyuk! Your jokes are awesome,
mister. They never get old!
 Was that supposed to be funny? Ooh...
Urge to kill... rising... Go to hell!
Yikes... Th-That was real lame...
  Ooohehehe  Hyuk hyuk! And then? And then?
 So what? Just 'cause I'm a ฬ
doesn't mean I have time to waste!
Ooohehehe! I like pointless stories
like that.
   Hyuk hyuk! You fell for it, just like
I hoped!
 Uuuurrrgh! What was that for, you brown-
haired meanie!?
   Yikes... What an old trick... That's not
very good, mister.
  Hyuk hyuk! Huh? What's that? It looks
even yummier than life stones!
   Uuuurrrgh! Don't make fun of me, you rich
jerk! I don't want that stuff!
I want something else!
  Oooh, I like that. Are you gonna give it
to me? Oooh   Hyuk hyuk! You must be a rationalist,
mister. I like those guys.
   Uuuurrrrgh! How dare you go on and on
about ฬ!?
  Ooohehehe! You're so right, mister!
Hyuk hyuk! Th-That was so cool... I wish
I could say stuff like that.
  Don't make fun of me you rich jerk!
You're the one people should be making
fun of!
 Eep...! I-I'm scared...!
 Huh, so that's how people see us.
I learned something new today!
 Grrrr! Your face is already a disgrace!
Ooohehehe! Well said! La la la, la 
Hyuk hyuk! So that's how they dance
in Shibuya!
Huh? Don't try to dance when you can't
even fly!
Just call it off, mister! There's no
reason to push yourself too hard!
   Not bad, mister! But I'm waaaaaay better
than you!
 Hyuk hyuk! Are you gonna come after me?
Or should I go after you?
Uuuurrrrgh! Talk normal, idiot!
Eep... I'm scared, and I'm not even
sure why!
  Hyuk hyuk! Aren't you staring at the
wrong person, mister?
 Are you making fun of me? Do you think
I'm a lowly ฬ!? Grrr...
That's really annoying!
 Ooohehehe! Do you need something from
me? What is it? C'mon, tell me!
Hyuk hyuk! Wow, I didn't know that!
But it sounds so fake...
 There's no way that's true! Are you
stupid mister? You big dummy!
  Ooohehehe! I knew it! I just had
this feeling...
   Uuuurrrrgh! I'm a ฬ!
Don't make fun of us demons!
  Yikes... *shiver*
  I'm scarier than that story! Hey, tell
me another one.
   Wow, lady! You have a cool American
accent! Do you come from the same
place I do?
  Uuuurrrrgh! I don't like anything
except rap! C'mon, drop some rhymes!
   Ooohehehehe! That song's cute!
 Hyuk hyuk! You say some pretty cute
things, lady.
  Uuuurrrgh! I'm not a kid like you think
I am!
  Oooohehehehe! Wanna act like a baby,
too? The more, the better!
  Hyuk hyuk! It must be tough for you too,
lady. Maybe next time, if I'm free, I'll
be up for it.
It's not easy to pick me up, you know!
I'm not a cheap ฬ!
  Ooohehehe! I guess I'm still useful!
Ooohehehehehe!
  Hyuk hyuk! You've got style, lady!
No ฬ could ever say such
horrible things!
  Don't make fun of me, you bimbo!
   Eep... N-No way... I can't believe you
went that far...
Hyuk hyuk! What do you want with me, lady?
My spell card, maybe?
Uuuurrrgh! Wh-What do you want me to do!?
I don't understand! It's too hard!
  Yay! Yaaaaay! Let's do it! You're the
best, lady!
  Hyuk hyuk! You're a weird lady. There's
drool coming out your eyes!
So what? Too much trouble!
 Yikes... The human world is a scary
place, huh...?
   Hyuk hyuk! Does that mean you're gonna
cut off my head?
Teeheehee... I don't even have a neck!
Uuuurrrgh! Don't make fun of me!
You stupid, dumb, doodyhead!
  Eeep... I-I see...
   How could you say something like that!?
That's just like a grown-up! You suck!
 Eep... Y-You don't hate me, do you,
lady...?
   Ooohehehehe! Do it again! Again!
 Hyuk hyuk! You really know everything,
huh lady? You're amazing!
 Just 'cause you're more grown up doesn't
mean you can be cocky, lady!
  Ooohehehe! I knew that already!
I'm smart, huh? Ooohehehehe!
  I'm a ฬ, you know!
It's normal for us to do that stuff!
Yikes... Okay... I understand...
   Ooohehehehe! I mean, I'm not even out
of preschool yet!
Hey, lady. If you know neat stuff, let's
talk! Please...?
What are you looking at!? Uuuurrrrgh!
You're SO aggravating!
   D... Did I do something bad...?
Hyuk hyuk! Hey, what is it? Tell me!
   Uuuurrrrgh! What are you looking at?
Don't make me kill you...!
  Y-Yikes... Be honest with me, mister...
You're gonna attack, aren't you...?
Hyuk hyuk! You're pretty good at making
cool threats, mister.
  Uuuurrrrgh! I'm not scared at all!
You'll see!
 Eep... Th-That's not true...
I can still come out on top!
  Uuuurrrrgh!e! Oooohehehe!
Are you a magician, mister? C-Could you
teach me a trick or two sometime...?
   Eeep... Warlocks are scary...
  Ooohehehe! Your tricks are the best,
mister!
You're so good I bet Mr. Loki would get
all jealous of you. Ooohehehehe!
 Hyuk hyuk! I don't really get it, but
that's an interesting story.
 Hyuk hyuk! Human stories are so
interesting...
Hey, you're in the mood to give me
something just 'cause, right?
  Uuuurrrrgh! So what!? Will you shut up
already!?
   Uuuurrrgh! I don't wanna hear a story
like that! I want something physical!
   Eep... I think... I've found the truth...
  Eep...! That doesn't have anything to do
with me...!
   Ooohehehe! I knew you'd try that!
Every ฬ has a good
sixth sense.
 Ooohehehe! Humans say some fun things!
 Hyuk hyuk! You can tell how strong
I am!? You're amazing!
  You want my help!? Wow, what a surprise...
Gimme something in return for surprising
me like that.
 Uuuurrrgh! I'm a ฬ!
I can't help humans!
   Uuuurrrgh! That's boring! You oughtta
give me something!
  Eep... Th-That has nothing to do
with me...
Eep... I don't wanna...!
   Ooohehehehe! I don't get it, but it's
still fun!
   Ooohehehehe! It's great to be needed!
  Hyuk hyuk! Are you trying to make
me mad?
Teehee... You're funny!
 Hyuk hyuk! I don't feel a thing from
stuff like that.
C'mon, do something else! Please?
Pretty please?
Uuuurrrgh! Don't make fun of me!
   Uuuurrrgh! That's boring! You gotta
give me something!
Eep... Do you have fun doing stuff
I don't like?
   Eep... The way you're treating me...
Are you one of those dangerous humans?
Ooohehehehe! I don't get it, but it's
still fun!
   Ooohehehehe! I figured out what you're
trying to do!
I'm not gonna run away just 'cause you
did that, though.
 Hyuk hyuk! Hey, can you do anything else?
  Hyuk hyuk! Alright, I'll let you give
me something.
   Uuuurrrgh! Sooo booooring...
   Uuuurrrgh! This is so boring, I hope
you roll over and die!
But first, gimme something.
  Eep... What was that all about...?
Is your brain still in your head?
   Eeep... Are you one of those guys
who's... not all there?
  Ooohehehe! This is sooo much fun!
  Yaaaaaay! This is so fun!
  Hyuk hyuk! Awww, that's so cool!
I wonder what I should do.
What should I do...? Okay, I got it!
Listen to my request!
Uuuurrrgh! You can't upset me that easy!
   Uuuurrrgh! I'm greedy, you know?
Real greedy!
 Eep... I'm sweating a different kind
of sweat than usual...
Eep... What's this feeling...?
 Ooohehehehe! Now you're talking!
   Ooohehehehe! I'm right on the edge of
being seduced, huh!?
 That's riiiiight! You really know a lot
about me!
  Hyuk hyuk! That's right. Don't you think
so too?
Hmm... Well then... how about if you
give me a present!
 Uuuurrrgh! You don't mean that at all!
 Uuuurrrgh! Then prove you meant it!
   Eeep... How do you know so much
about me...?
   Eep... I'm worried what happens next if
you're flattering me this much...
  Ooohehehehe! I haven't been in this good
of a mood in a while!
 Ooohehehe! That's right! I'm amazing!
  Ohhh... You already have my spell card!
Oooooheeheeheeeee!
 I'm Polter Poltoleon. If you see this
message, you'll go "ooohehehehe!" too!
   Huhhh...? Aren't you weaker than me?
Haha, you're so lame! I'm not giving
you my spell card!
  Huh!? C'mon, don't be so cruel...
  Alright! I'll give you this!
   This is for you too.
   Um, well... I guess I'll give you this.
See you later! Oooooheeheeheeeeee!
 I gotta get going... A ฬ
doesn't have much free time!
  I'll give you this if you forgive me...
I don't wanna talk to you anymore.
Seeya!
  You're so finished. I'll give you this...
Let's just say goodbye here.
 If I was gonna express how I'm feeling
right now, I'd say... Uuuurrrgh!
Seriously!
 I'm glad to meet you... I mean, take good
care of my card!
 I made up my mind! I'm coming too!
But that's not really up to me, huh...?
 I don't like to fight. I'm tired of
everyone getting hurt.
 Instead... I'll give you this.
 Eep...! I'll give you my spell card!
Just please let me go...
  Hyuk hyuk! Us and humans are pretty
different!
 Hyuk hyuk! I'm really curious now!
Can you pique my interest...?
  Uuuurrrgh! Why did you answer, mister!?
Now I'm all annoyed!
   Uuuurrrgh! If you want me to calm down,
you have to gimme something!
  Eep... I called someone and it turns
out they're really scary...
A-Am I... gonna get beat up...? Noooo!
I don't want to!
  Eeep...! L-Let me make it clear...
I-I'm not good to eat... And I'm not
crunchy in milk either...
 Ooohehehehe! I'm really happy right now!
   Ooohehehe! Let's play, mister! Okay?
   Uh-oh... humans! Hmm... I don't really
wanna deal with them, but I don't feel
like running away either.
   Why are humans human!? I don't get it.
And that annoys me, so gimme something!
   Hyuk... For me, it's like how they
say... curiosity trumps fear...
I felt like there was something I was
drawn to... But I guess I'll hang around
with you a while...
I think tonight's the night I finally
fall in love with humans!
   I want lots of kinds of friends. Hmm...
Maybe humans would be good too...
 Who're you, mister...? Who!? Who are
you, darn it...?
 Eep... Th-That was scary!
But I'm not gonna run!
  Ooohehehe! Haha... By the way, I'm pretty
mad right now!
  What a great full moon! You just have to
gimme something!
Teeheehee! There's lots of stuff I
want... What should I ask for?
 I'm trembling... Is this excitement!?
 Hyuk... Humans are nice, right?
I don't have to be nervous, right?
   Hyuk hyuk! Humans are interesting.
What do you need from me?
   Uuuurrrgh! I don't like this kind of
negotiation! I'm real mad now!
Eep... Why are you doing that...?
I'm scared...
Ooohehehehe! Ooohehehe! That was REALLY
fun! I'm so happy!
 So basically, you want me to do
something, right!?
 Hyuk... So... uh... wh-what do you
want from me...?
This is the most fun I ever had! I'll do
whatever you want!
Eep... Ooohehehe! Hyuck hehehe!
Teehee... hyuk hyuk hyuk...
You call that negotiating!? I don't
like stupidheads. Hahahah...
   Hyuk... Humans are so amazing. I dunno
what to say. Teehee!
I want money.
<Amount> yen will be fine.
  Yaaaaaay!
  What!? You don't have any! Grrrr!
  I'm gonna kill you.
I want a life stone. Just one...
   Yaaaaay! I got a life stone!
Hooray!
   Huh!? You don't have any!? You're a big
dummy, aren't you? Stupid!
 Don't make fun of me! I'll throw plates
at you! I'll break windows!
I know you'll probably say no...
but I want a ...
 No way, seriously!? Yaaaaay!
   Oh... you don't have any... Oops!
Crud, I just broke a window somewhere.
   You're right, it's too bad... But I'm
still gonna kill you.
Vital energy looks cool... Does it taste
good? Let me try some!
Th-This looks delicious... Chow time!
  Huh...? I don't need any!? Ooohhhhh,
you make me so mad!
   I'm so happy! Even if I don't have any
ears... Ooohehehehe!
Don't make fun of me!
  Oooheeheeheeheeeee!
Don't make fun of me!
  I'll buy it!
   Wow! You've got guts!
  Don't make fun of me... Go to hell!
Wh-What...? Then what am I supposed
to do?
 What? "Yaaaay"...? You can just roll
over and die.
 Yep, it's me. I don't get it, but that
has a nice ring to it!
  R-Really...?
   Huh!? I-I think my heart's starting
to pound!
  Turtles! Dogs! Cats! That's the stuff
I like! Oops... I kinda drooled.
 That place is s-s-scary... I-It's a
scary place... eep...
  What's that about? Hey, you liar!
You can't talk in a pool!
Oh, crud...
Phew...
What're you doing!? I was having so much
fun doing that!
   Oooheheheheeeeeeee!
Yep! You and me hit it off really good,
mister!
Then why'd you tell me that!?
  WHAT!? I hate British people!
  Awww... that finger's so cool...
I'm not allowed to do it... but it
would be fun if I could!
  Huh!? Really!? C'mon, hurry up and gimme!
Teehee! This is gonna be awesome!
Awww, really...? Now I'm curious...
Hmm... what could it be?
   Huh...? Saying that stuff to a
ฬ... Are you one of
those people who lives on the edge?
 Grrrrrr! Don't make fun of Germans!
Eep... yikes... Someone help me...
 Don't say that with such a straight face!
Wow, you're an embarrassing human!
Just go roll over and die.
R-Really...? Humans are scary...
   Huh? Minced meat? BBQ sauce? Meat sauce?
Meaty meat? Hey, what's so meaty
about that?
  Yep. I'll do it! I'm doing this!
   N-No way... Do you like getting
beat up...?
Grrr! I hate when people say that!
 Ooohehehehe! Isn't that cool!? Thumbing
doesn't work on me!
Huh...? What are you looking at, mister?
You're such a pervert...
  Nuh-uh!
Ooohehehehe! I thought so! You can't
fool me!
  Yaaaaaay! I broke that plate!
  "What mask?" Don't make fun of me!
 Yep! This'll be a good partner for me.
 Don't make fun of me! Go back to
America, lady!
Who's that? I don't know anyone like
that. Who could it be...?
 ...Hmm... If you're being this nice...
Maybe you're up to something...
 You're kind of like a mommy, lady...
   Ooohehehehe! I'm so popular!
   Huuuh? What's that about...? You better
not have been making fun of me!
Eeep... I'll pass... My tummy's not
feeling so good right now...
   Okay, I'll forget it.
  Eeep... You're one mean lady...
Ohhhh, you were joking. Phew!
  Teehee! I'm so excited!
Huh!? Why? Why won't you say it!?
  Haha, that's not true at all! I think
it'd be fun to go with you, lady.
No way! That was totally amazing!
  You know, I'm good at showing up
in photos!
I've had it... I've completely lost it!
Don't make fun of me! Roll over and die!
   Hyuk hyuk! You've got bones, mister!
   Huh... Me too, then!
   Humans are that poor? I never knew that...
 I wonder if I failed... If I said "life
stones," maybe I could've gotten one...
Huh!? You don't have any!? Whoa...
Life stones are important when you
wanna negotiate, you know.
   I wonder if I failed... If I said "money,"
maybe I could've gotten some...
 I'm not surprised... they are gems
and all... But I'm still kinda
disappointed.
A-Are you saying you don't need me?
You're a meanie...
 Uuuurrrghgggghhh!
Ooh, that had a cool rhythm... I'll give
you my spell card!
  ...Oh, that's right! I'll give you my
spell card. If you make a Person with
me, we can stay together!
