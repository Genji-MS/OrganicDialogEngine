My name is Igor... I am delighted to
make your acquaintance.
▶Igor
This place exists between dream and
reality, mind and matter...
▶Igor
It's been quite some time since we last
had a guest.
▶Igor
This is a room that only those bound by
a "contract" may enter...
▶Igor
From this day forth, you will be our
guest in this Velvet Room.
▶Igor
Your destiny will require you to hone
your power...
▶Igor
And for that, you will inevitably
require our help.
▶Igor
The Velvet Room is also known as the
room of Personas.
▶Igor
A Persona is a side of you that shows
itself when you face the world...
▶Igor
Think of it as a facade of protection
you wear to face hardships in life.
▶Igor
Hm... Perhaps that may have been rather
difficult to understand...
▶Igor
To battle opponents that cannot be
dealt with by human strength alone...
▶Igor
We in this room will lend you inhuman
power... The power of demons...
▶Igor
Now then. Allow me to explain my role
here...
▶Igor
I will assist you in giving birth to
new Personas.
▶Igor
The demons contained within the |ԏspell
cards|  you hold will be fused as one...
▶Igor
Thereby creating a new Persona.
▶Igor
Should you find yourselves with these
cards, please do bring them here.
  ▶Igor
Welcome to the Velvet Room...
   ▶Igor
What is it you desire?
▶Igor
Well then, what would you like
to know?
Ԡ
  ▶Igor
I'm afraid you don't have enough |ԏspell
cards|  to give birth to a new Persona.
▶Igor
Alas, we cannot look after any more
Personas.
   ▶Igor
What would you like to do?Ԟ
▶Igor
Well then... Farewell...
▶Igor
If it's new Personas you want, I shall
fuse and create them for you.
▶Igor
First, though, I must summon demons to
fuse together into a Persona.
▶Igor
And for that, a certain type of card
is necessary.
▶Igor
You see, these cards are inscribed with
demon-summoning spells.
▶Igor
They are known as spell cards, and all
demons carry one.
▶Igor
Thus, in order to perform a fusion, I
will need you to gather spell cards.
▶Igor
Go forth, negotiate with demons,
and bring these spell cards back here.
▶Igor
Combat is not the only way to deal
with demons... Do you understand?
▶Igor
And not all demons are necessarily
wishing for a fight...
 ▶Igor
It isn't enough merely to fuse a new
Persona in order to make it your own...
▶Igor
There is rather more to it than that,
I'm afraid.
▶Igor
You must take a Persona onto yourself
in order to use its power.
▶Igor
Each of you is capable of holding up
to three Personas.
▶Igor
A newly-fused Persona will be entrusted
into my care.
▶Igor
By all means let me know when you
would like to take on new Personas.
▶Igor
But I can only look after 16 Personas
at a time, mind you.
▶Igor
There are as many Personas as there are
personalities... an infinite variety.
▶Igor
Each has its own form and substance,
to be used according to the situation.
▶Igor
If you can master that principle,
you will make a fine Persona-user.
▶Igor
Each of you can take on as many as
three Personas at once.
▶Igor
Of the three, only one can be actively
invoked during battle.
▶Igor
To invoke a Persona is to summon it
in combat.
▶Igor
The remaining two will remain on
standby...
▶Igor
Ready to be assumed at any time
during battle.
▶Igor
Different active Personas will grant
you different abilities.
▶Igor
Without the power of Persona, you are
no different than an ordinary human...
▶Igor
You will be powerless before the arcane
might of the demons' spells.
▶Igor
If by chance you were hit by a spell in
that state, you would be struck down.
▶Igor
But by taking on a Persona, your defense
against spells is considerably enhanced.
▶Igor
For some, it may also confer strength,
or increase luck for others.
▶Igor
This, too, is the power of Persona.
▶Igor
Though they are called Personas, each
is a hidden side of yourself.
▶Igor
I suggest you examine your status
carefully after assuming one.
▶Igor
That way, you can see which of your
qualities have changed.
▶Igor
At first, you will be unable to harness
your Persona's powers to the fullest.
▶Igor
But the more you invoke a Persona,
the more powers it will grant you.
▶Igor
As your Persona learns new skills, you
will have more options in battle.
▶Igor
Even if your Persona learns a powerful
skill, the SP required remains constant.
▶Igor
You will grow in combat, but do not
forget that your Personas grow as well.
▶Igor
Pardon me for being nosy, but...
▶Igor
Personas have eight levels of growth.
You should try to develop them fully.
▶Igor
I'm sure that there will be an ample
reward for doing so...
▶Igor
You might also be interested to know
about various factors in fusion.
▶Igor
For example, even when creating the
same Persona...
▶Igor
The combination of spell cards, the
affinities of the demons used...
▶Igor
The position of Terra and Luna, and any
essences added into the mix...
▶Igor
All of these factor into the resultant
Persona. And one more thing...
▶Igor
You may also add an item into the
fusion to trigger a change.
▶Igor
There are some items for which the
result is easily predictable...
▶Igor
But sometimes, even I will be unable
to guess at what may happen.
▶Igor
Should that come about, I do hope that
you'll pardon me.
▶Igor
But make no mistake, I do believe it
is worth trying...
▶Igor
I suggest gems for obtaining a higher-
or lower-ranked fusion within an order.
▶Igor
As for the other items' effects, you
should experiment for yourself.▶Bizarre-looking man

skill, the SP required remains constant.
▶Igor
You will grow in combat, but do not
forget that your Personas grow as well.
▶Igor
Pardon me for being nosy, but...
▶Igor
Personas have eight levels of growth.
You should try to develop them fully.
▶Igor
I'm sure that there will be an ample
reward for doing so...
▶Igor
You might also be interested to know
about various factors in fusion.
▶Igor
For example, even when creating the
same Persona...
▶Igor
The combination of spell cards, the
affinities of the demons used...
▶Igor
The position of Terra and Luna, and any
essences added into the mix...
▶Igor
All of these factor into the resultant
Persona. And one more thing...
▶Igor
You may also add an item into the
fusion to trigger a change.
▶Igor
There are some items for which the
result is easily predictable...
▶Igor
But sometimes, even I will be unable
to guess at what may happen.
▶Igor
Should that come about, I do hope that
you'll pardon me.
▶Igor
But make no mistake, I do believe it
is worth trying...
▶Igor
I suggest gems for obtaining a higher-
or lower-ranked fusion within an order.
▶Igor
As for the other items' effects, you
should experiment for yourself.▶Bizarre-looking man
My name is Igor... I am delighted to
make your acquaintance.
▶Igor
This place exists between dream and
reality, mind and matter...
▶Igor
It's been quite some time since we last
had a guest.
▶Igor
This is a room that only those bound by
a "contract" may enter...
▶Igor
From this day forth, you will be our
guest in this Velvet Room.
▶Igor
Your destiny will require you to hone
your power...
▶Igor
And for that, you will inevitably
require our help.
▶Igor
The Velvet Room is also known as the
room of Personas.
▶Igor
A Persona is a side of you that shows
itself when you face the world...
▶Igor
Think of it as a facade of protection
you wear to face hardships in life.
▶Igor
Hm... Perhaps that may have been rather
difficult to understand...
▶Igor
To battle opponents that cannot be
dealt with by human strength alone...
▶Igor
We in this room will lend you inhuman
power... The power of demons...
▶Igor
Now then. Allow me to explain my role
here...
▶Igor
I will assist you in giving birth to
new Personas.
▶Igor
The demons contained within the |ԏspell
cards|  you hold will be fused as one...
▶Igor
Thereby creating a new Persona.
▶Igor
Should you find yourselves with these
cards, please do bring them here.
  ▶Igor
Welcome to the Velvet Room...
   ▶Igor
What is it you desire?
▶Igor
Well then, what would you like
to know?
Ԡ
  ▶Igor
I'm afraid you don't have enough |ԏspell
cards|  to give birth to a new Persona.
▶Igor
Alas, we cannot look after any more
Personas.
   ▶Igor
What would you like to do?Ԟ
▶Igor
Well then... Farewell...
▶Igor
If it's new Personas you want, I shall
fuse and create them for you.
▶Igor
First, though, I must summon demons to
fuse together into a Persona.
▶Igor
And for that, a certain type of card
is necessary.
▶Igor
You see, these cards are inscribed with
demon-summoning spells.
▶Igor
They are known as spell cards, and all
demons carry one.
▶Igor
Thus, in order to perform a fusion, I
will need you to gather spell cards.
▶Igor
Go forth, negotiate with demons,
and bring these spell cards back here.
▶Igor
Combat is not the only way to deal
with demons... Do you understand?
▶Igor
And not all demons are necessarily
wishing for a fight...
 ▶Igor
It isn't enough merely to fuse a new
Persona in order to make it your own...
▶Igor
There is rather more to it than that,
I'm afraid.
▶Igor
You must take a Persona onto yourself
in order to use its power.
▶Igor
Each of you is capable of holding up
to three Personas.
▶Igor
A newly-fused Persona will be entrusted
into my care.
▶Igor
By all means let me know when you
would like to take on new Personas.
▶Igor
But I can only look after 16 Personas
at a time, mind you.
▶Igor
There are as many Personas as there are
personalities... an infinite variety.
▶Igor
Each has its own form and substance,
to be used according to the situation.
▶Igor
If you can master that principle,
you will make a fine Persona-user.
▶Igor
Each of you can take on as many as
three Personas at once.
▶Igor
Of the three, only one can be actively
invoked during battle.
▶Igor
To invoke a Persona is to summon it
in combat.
▶Igor
The remaining two will remain on
standby...
▶Igor
Ready to be assumed at any time
during battle.
▶Igor
Different active Personas will grant
you different abilities.
▶Igor
Without the power of Persona, you are
no different than an ordinary human...
▶Igor
You will be powerless before the arcane
might of the demons' spells.
▶Igor
If by chance you were hit by a spell in
that state, you would be struck down.
▶Igor
But by taking on a Persona, your defense
against spells is considerably enhanced.
▶Igor
For some, it may also confer strength,
or increase luck for others.
▶Igor
This, too, is the power of Persona.
▶Igor
Though they are called Personas, each
is a hidden side of yourself.
▶Igor
I suggest you examine your status
carefully after assuming one.
▶Igor
That way, you can see which of your
qualities have changed.
▶Igor
At first, you will be unable to harness
your Persona's powers to the fullest.
▶Igor
But the more you invoke a Persona,
the more powers it will grant you.
▶Igor
As your Persona learns new skills, you
will have more options in battle.
▶Igor
Even if your Persona learns a powerful
skill, the SP required remains constant.
▶Igor
You will grow in combat, but do not
forget that your Personas grow as well.
▶Igor

Ready to be assumed at any time
during battle.
▶Igor
Different active Personas will grant
you different abilities.
▶Igor
Without the power of Persona, you are
no different than an ordinary human...
▶Igor
You will be powerless before the arcane
might of the demons' spells.
▶Igor
If by chance you were hit by a spell in
that state, you would be struck down.
▶Igor
But by taking on a Persona, your defense
against spells is considerably enhanced.
▶Igor
For some, it may also confer strength,
or increase luck for others.
▶Igor
This, too, is the power of Persona.
▶Igor
Though they are called Personas, each
is a hidden side of yourself.
▶Igor
I suggest you examine your status
carefully after assuming one.
▶Igor
That way, you can see which of your
qualities have changed.
▶Igor
At first, you will be unable to harness
your Persona's powers to the fullest.
▶Igor
But the more you invoke a Persona,
the more powers it will grant you.
▶Igor
As your Persona learns new skills, you
will have more options in battle.
▶Igor
Even if your Persona learns a powerful
skill, the SP required remains constant.
▶Igor
You will grow in combat, but do not
forget that your Personas grow as well.
▶Igor
Pardon me for being nosy, but...
▶Igor
Personas have eight levels of growth.
You should try to develop them fully.
▶Igor
I'm sure that there will be an ample
reward for doing so...
▶Igor
You might also be interested to know
about various factors in fusion.
▶Igor
For example, even when creating the
same Persona...
▶Igor
The combination of spell cards, the
affinities of the demons used...
▶Igor
The position of Terra and Luna, and any
essences added into the mix...
▶Igor
All of these factor into the resultant
Persona. And one more thing...
▶Igor
You may also add an item into the
fusion to trigger a change.
▶Igor
There are some items for which the
result is easily predictable...
▶Igor
But sometimes, even I will be unable
to guess at what may happen.
▶Igor
Should that come about, I do hope that
you'll pardon me.
▶Igor
But make no mistake, I do believe it
is worth trying...
▶Igor
I suggest gems for obtaining a higher-
or lower-ranked fusion within an order.
▶Igor
As for the other items' effects, you
should experiment for yourself.▶Bizarre-looking man
My name is Igor... I am delighted to
make your acquaintance.
▶Igor
This place exists between dream and
reality, mind and matter...
▶Igor
It's been quite some time since we last
had a guest.
▶Igor
This is a room that only those bound by
a "contract" may enter...
▶Igor
From this day forth, you will be our
guest in this Velvet Room.
▶Igor
Your destiny will require you to hone
your power...
▶Igor
And for that, you will inevitably
require our help.
▶Igor
The Velvet Room is also known as the
room of Personas.
▶Igor
A Persona is a side of you that shows
itself when you face the world...
▶Igor
Think of it as a facade of protection
you wear to face hardships in life.
▶Igor
Hm... Perhaps that may have been rather
difficult to understand...
▶Igor
To battle opponents that cannot be
dealt with by human strength alone...
▶Igor
We in this room will lend you inhuman
power... The power of demons...
▶Igor
Now then. Allow me to explain my role
here...
▶Igor
I will assist you in giving birth to
new Personas.
▶Igor
The demons contained within the |ԏspell
cards|  you hold will be fused as one...
▶Igor
Thereby creating a new Persona.
▶Igor
Should you find yourselves with these
cards, please do bring them here.
  ▶Igor
Welcome to the Velvet Room...
   ▶Igor
What is it you desire?
▶Igor
Well then, what would you like
to know?
Ԡ
  ▶Igor
I'm afraid you don't have enough |ԏspell
cards|  to give birth to a new Persona.
▶Igor
Alas, we cannot look after any more
Personas.
   ▶Igor
What would you like to do?Ԟ
▶Igor
Well then... Farewell...
▶Igor
If it's new Personas you want, I shall
fuse and create them for you.
▶Igor
First, though, I must summon demons to
fuse together into a Persona.
▶Igor
And for that, a certain type of card
is necessary.
▶Igor
You see, these cards are inscribed with
demon-summoning spells.
▶Igor
They are known as spell cards, and all
demons carry one.
▶Igor
Thus, in order to perform a fusion, I
will need you to gather spell cards.
▶Igor
Go forth, negotiate with demons,
and bring these spell cards back here.
▶Igor
Combat is not the only way to deal
with demons... Do you understand?
▶Igor
And not all demons are necessarily
wishing for a fight...
 ▶Igor
It isn't enough merely to fuse a new
Persona in order to make it your own...
▶Igor
There is rather more to it than that,
I'm afraid.
▶Igor
You must take a Persona onto yourself
in order to use its power.
▶Igor
Each of you is capable of holding up
to three Personas.
▶Igor
A newly-fused Persona will be entrusted
into my care.
▶Igor
By all means let me know when you
would like to take on new Personas.
▶Igor
But I can only look after 16 Personas
at a time, mind you.
▶Igor
There are as many Personas as there are
personalities... an infinite variety.
▶Igor
Each has its own form and substance,
to be used according to the situation.
▶Igor
If you can master that principle,
you will make a fine Persona-user.
▶Igor
Each of you can take on as many as
three Personas at once.
▶Igor
Of the three, only one can be actively
invoked during battle.
▶Igor
To invoke a Persona is to summon it
in combat.
▶Igor
The remaining two will remain on
standby...
▶Igor
Ready to be assumed at any time
during battle.
▶Igor
Different active Personas will grant
you different abilities.

It isn't enough merely to fuse a new
Persona in order to make it your own...
▶Igor
There is rather more to it than that,
I'm afraid.
▶Igor
You must take a Persona onto yourself
in order to use its power.
▶Igor
Each of you is capable of holding up
to three Personas.
▶Igor
A newly-fused Persona will be entrusted
into my care.
▶Igor
By all means let me know when you
would like to take on new Personas.
▶Igor
But I can only look after 16 Personas
at a time, mind you.
▶Igor
There are as many Personas as there are
personalities... an infinite variety.
▶Igor
Each has its own form and substance,
to be used according to the situation.
▶Igor
If you can master that principle,
you will make a fine Persona-user.
▶Igor
Each of you can take on as many as
three Personas at once.
▶Igor
Of the three, only one can be actively
invoked during battle.
▶Igor
To invoke a Persona is to summon it
in combat.
▶Igor
The remaining two will remain on
standby...
▶Igor
Ready to be assumed at any time
during battle.
▶Igor
Different active Personas will grant
you different abilities.
▶Igor
Without the power of Persona, you are
no different than an ordinary human...
▶Igor
You will be powerless before the arcane
might of the demons' spells.
▶Igor
If by chance you were hit by a spell in
that state, you would be struck down.
▶Igor
But by taking on a Persona, your defense
against spells is considerably enhanced.
▶Igor
For some, it may also confer strength,
or increase luck for others.
▶Igor
This, too, is the power of Persona.
▶Igor
Though they are called Personas, each
is a hidden side of yourself.
▶Igor
I suggest you examine your status
carefully after assuming one.
▶Igor
That way, you can see which of your
qualities have changed.
▶Igor
At first, you will be unable to harness
your Persona's powers to the fullest.
▶Igor
But the more you invoke a Persona,
the more powers it will grant you.
▶Igor
As your Persona learns new skills, you
will have more options in battle.
▶Igor
Even if your Persona learns a powerful
skill, the SP required remains constant.
▶Igor
You will grow in combat, but do not
forget that your Personas grow as well.
▶Igor
Pardon me for being nosy, but...
▶Igor
Personas have eight levels of growth.
You should try to develop them fully.
▶Igor
I'm sure that there will be an ample
reward for doing so...
▶Igor
You might also be interested to know
about various factors in fusion.
▶Igor
For example, even when creating the
same Persona...
▶Igor
The combination of spell cards, the
affinities of the demons used...
▶Igor
The position of Terra and Luna, and any
essences added into the mix...
▶Igor
All of these factor into the resultant
Persona. And one more thing...
▶Igor
You may also add an item into the
fusion to trigger a change.
▶Igor
There are some items for which the
result is easily predictable...
▶Igor
But sometimes, even I will be unable
to guess at what may happen.
▶Igor
Should that come about, I do hope that
you'll pardon me.
▶Igor
But make no mistake, I do believe it
is worth trying...
▶Igor
I suggest gems for obtaining a higher-
or lower-ranked fusion within an order.
▶Igor
As for the other items' effects, you
should experiment for yourself.▶Bizarre-looking man
My name is Igor... I am delighted to
make your acquaintance.
▶Igor
This place exists between dream and
reality, mind and matter...
▶Igor
It's been quite some time since we last
had a guest.
▶Igor
This is a room that only those bound by
a "contract" may enter...
▶Igor
From this day forth, you will be our
guest in this Velvet Room.
▶Igor
Your destiny will require you to hone
your power...
▶Igor
And for that, you will inevitably
require our help.
▶Igor
The Velvet Room is also known as the
room of Personas.
▶Igor
A Persona is a side of you that shows
itself when you face the world...
▶Igor
Think of it as a facade of protection
you wear to face hardships in life.
▶Igor
Hm... Perhaps that may have been rather
difficult to understand...
▶Igor
To battle opponents that cannot be
dealt with by human strength alone...
▶Igor
We in this room will lend you inhuman
power... The power of demons...
▶Igor
Now then. Allow me to explain my role
here...
▶Igor
I will assist you in giving birth to
new Personas.
▶Igor
The demons contained within the |ԏspell
cards|  you hold will be fused as one...
▶Igor
Thereby creating a new Persona.
▶Igor
Should you find yourselves with these
cards, please do bring them here.
  ▶Igor
Welcome to the Velvet Room...
   ▶Igor
What is it you desire?
▶Igor
Well then, what would you like
to know?
Ԡ
  ▶Igor
I'm afraid you don't have enough |ԏspell
cards|  to give birth to a new Persona.
▶Igor
Alas, we cannot look after any more
Personas.
   ▶Igor
What would you like to do?Ԟ
▶Igor
Well then... Farewell...
▶Igor
If it's new Personas you want, I shall
fuse and create them for you.
▶Igor
First, though, I must summon demons to
fuse together into a Persona.
▶Igor
And for that, a certain type of card
is necessary.
▶Igor
You see, these cards are inscribed with
demon-summoning spells.
▶Igor
They are known as spell cards, and all
demons carry one.
▶Igor
Thus, in order to perform a fusion, I
will need you to gather spell cards.
▶Igor
Go forth, negotiate with demons,
and bring these spell cards back here.
▶Igor
Combat is not the only way to deal
with demons... Do you understand?
▶Igor
And not all demons are necessarily
wishing for a fight...

Well then, what would you like
to know?
Ԡ
  ▶Igor
I'm afraid you don't have enough |ԏspell
cards|  to give birth to a new Persona.
▶Igor
Alas, we cannot look after any more
Personas.
   ▶Igor
What would you like to do?Ԟ
▶Igor
Well then... Farewell...
▶Igor
If it's new Personas you want, I shall
fuse and create them for you.
▶Igor
First, though, I must summon demons to
fuse together into a Persona.
▶Igor
And for that, a certain type of card
is necessary.
▶Igor
You see, these cards are inscribed with
demon-summoning spells.
▶Igor
They are known as spell cards, and all
demons carry one.
▶Igor
Thus, in order to perform a fusion, I
will need you to gather spell cards.
▶Igor
Go forth, negotiate with demons,
and bring these spell cards back here.
▶Igor
Combat is not the only way to deal
with demons... Do you understand?
▶Igor
And not all demons are necessarily
wishing for a fight...
 ▶Igor
It isn't enough merely to fuse a new
Persona in order to make it your own...
▶Igor
There is rather more to it than that,
I'm afraid.
▶Igor
You must take a Persona onto yourself
in order to use its power.
▶Igor
Each of you is capable of holding up
to three Personas.
▶Igor
A newly-fused Persona will be entrusted
into my care.
▶Igor
By all means let me know when you
would like to take on new Personas.
▶Igor
But I can only look after 16 Personas
at a time, mind you.
▶Igor
There are as many Personas as there are
personalities... an infinite variety.
▶Igor
Each has its own form and substance,
to be used according to the situation.
▶Igor
If you can master that principle,
you will make a fine Persona-user.
▶Igor
Each of you can take on as many as
three Personas at once.
▶Igor
Of the three, only one can be actively
invoked during battle.
▶Igor
To invoke a Persona is to summon it
in combat.
▶Igor
The remaining two will remain on
standby...
▶Igor
Ready to be assumed at any time
during battle.
▶Igor
Different active Personas will grant
you different abilities.
▶Igor
Without the power of Persona, you are
no different than an ordinary human...
▶Igor
You will be powerless before the arcane
might of the demons' spells.
▶Igor
If by chance you were hit by a spell in
that state, you would be struck down.
▶Igor
But by taking on a Persona, your defense
against spells is considerably enhanced.
▶Igor
For some, it may also confer strength,
or increase luck for others.
▶Igor
This, too, is the power of Persona.
▶Igor
Though they are called Personas, each
is a hidden side of yourself.
▶Igor
I suggest you examine your status
carefully after assuming one.
▶Igor
That way, you can see which of your
qualities have changed.
▶Igor
At first, you will be unable to harness
your Persona's powers to the fullest.
▶Igor
But the more you invoke a Persona,
the more powers it will grant you.
▶Igor
As your Persona learns new skills, you
will have more options in battle.
▶Igor
Even if your Persona learns a powerful
skill, the SP required remains constant.
▶Igor
You will grow in combat, but do not
forget that your Personas grow as well.
▶Igor
Pardon me for being nosy, but...
▶Igor
Personas have eight levels of growth.
You should try to develop them fully.
▶Igor
I'm sure that there will be an ample
reward for doing so...
▶Igor
You might also be interested to know
about various factors in fusion.
▶Igor
For example, even when creating the
same Persona...
▶Igor
The combination of spell cards, the
affinities of the demons used...
▶Igor
The position of Terra and Luna, and any
essences added into the mix...
▶Igor
All of these factor into the resultant
Persona. And one more thing...
▶Igor
You may also add an item into the
fusion to trigger a change.
▶Igor
There are some items for which the
result is easily predictable...
▶Igor
But sometimes, even I will be unable
to guess at what may happen.
▶Igor
Should that come about, I do hope that
you'll pardon me.
▶Igor
But make no mistake, I do believe it
is worth trying...
▶Igor
I suggest gems for obtaining a higher-
or lower-ranked fusion within an order.
▶Igor
As for the other items' effects, you
should experiment for yourself.▶Bizarre-looking man
My name is Igor... I am delighted to
make your acquaintance.
▶Igor
This place exists between dream and
reality, mind and matter...
▶Igor
It's been quite some time since we last
had a guest.
▶Igor
This is a room that only those bound by
a "contract" may enter...
▶Igor
From this day forth, you will be our
guest in this Velvet Room.
▶Igor
Your destiny will require you to hone
your power...
▶Igor
And for that, you will inevitably
require our help.
▶Igor
The Velvet Room is also known as the
room of Personas.
▶Igor
A Persona is a side of you that shows
itself when you face the world...
▶Igor
Think of it as a facade of protection
you wear to face hardships in life.
▶Igor
Hm... Perhaps that may have been rather
difficult to understand...
▶Igor
To battle opponents that cannot be
dealt with by human strength alone...
▶Igor
We in this room will lend you inhuman
power... The power of demons...
▶Igor
Now then. Allow me to explain my role
here...
▶Igor
I will assist you in giving birth to
new Personas.
▶Igor
The demons contained within the |ԏspell
cards|  you hold will be fused as one...
▶Igor
Thereby creating a new Persona.
▶Igor
Should you find yourselves with these
cards, please do bring them here.

guest in this Velvet Room.
▶Igor
Your destiny will require you to hone
your power...
▶Igor
And for that, you will inevitably
require our help.
▶Igor
The Velvet Room is also known as the
room of Personas.
▶Igor
A Persona is a side of you that shows
itself when you face the world...
▶Igor
Think of it as a facade of protection
you wear to face hardships in life.
▶Igor
Hm... Perhaps that may have been rather
difficult to understand...
▶Igor
To battle opponents that cannot be
dealt with by human strength alone...
▶Igor
We in this room will lend you inhuman
power... The power of demons...
▶Igor
Now then. Allow me to explain my role
here...
▶Igor
I will assist you in giving birth to
new Personas.
▶Igor
The demons contained within the |ԏspell
cards|  you hold will be fused as one...
▶Igor
Thereby creating a new Persona.
▶Igor
Should you find yourselves with these
cards, please do bring them here.
  ▶Igor
Welcome to the Velvet Room...
   ▶Igor
What is it you desire?
▶Igor
Well then, what would you like
to know?
Ԡ
  ▶Igor
I'm afraid you don't have enough |ԏspell
cards|  to give birth to a new Persona.
▶Igor
Alas, we cannot look after any more
Personas.
   ▶Igor
What would you like to do?Ԟ
▶Igor
Well then... Farewell...
▶Igor
If it's new Personas you want, I shall
fuse and create them for you.
▶Igor
First, though, I must summon demons to
fuse together into a Persona.
▶Igor
And for that, a certain type of card
is necessary.
▶Igor
You see, these cards are inscribed with
demon-summoning spells.
▶Igor
They are known as spell cards, and all
demons carry one.
▶Igor
Thus, in order to perform a fusion, I
will need you to gather spell cards.
▶Igor
Go forth, negotiate with demons,
and bring these spell cards back here.
▶Igor
Combat is not the only way to deal
with demons... Do you understand?
▶Igor
And not all demons are necessarily
wishing for a fight...
 ▶Igor
It isn't enough merely to fuse a new
Persona in order to make it your own...
▶Igor
There is rather more to it than that,
I'm afraid.
▶Igor
You must take a Persona onto yourself
in order to use its power.
▶Igor
Each of you is capable of holding up
to three Personas.
▶Igor
A newly-fused Persona will be entrusted
into my care.
▶Igor
By all means let me know when you
would like to take on new Personas.
▶Igor
But I can only look after 16 Personas
at a time, mind you.
▶Igor
There are as many Personas as there are
personalities... an infinite variety.
▶Igor
Each has its own form and substance,
to be used according to the situation.
▶Igor
If you can master that principle,
you will make a fine Persona-user.
▶Igor
Each of you can take on as many as
three Personas at once.
▶Igor
Of the three, only one can be actively
invoked during battle.
▶Igor
To invoke a Persona is to summon it
in combat.
▶Igor
The remaining two will remain on
standby...
▶Igor
Ready to be assumed at any time
during battle.
▶Igor
Different active Personas will grant
you different abilities.
▶Igor
Without the power of Persona, you are
no different than an ordinary human...
▶Igor
You will be powerless before the arcane
might of the demons' spells.
▶Igor
If by chance you were hit by a spell in
that state, you would be struck down.
▶Igor
But by taking on a Persona, your defense
against spells is considerably enhanced.
▶Igor
For some, it may also confer strength,
or increase luck for others.
▶Igor
This, too, is the power of Persona.
▶Igor
Though they are called Personas, each
is a hidden side of yourself.
▶Igor
I suggest you examine your status
carefully after assuming one.
▶Igor
That way, you can see which of your
qualities have changed.
▶Igor
At first, you will be unable to harness
your Persona's powers to the fullest.
▶Igor
But the more you invoke a Persona,
the more powers it will grant you.
▶Igor
As your Persona learns new skills, you
will have more options in battle.
▶Igor
Even if your Persona learns a powerful
skill, the SP required remains constant.
▶Igor
You will grow in combat, but do not
forget that your Personas grow as well.
▶Igor
Pardon me for being nosy, but...
▶Igor
Personas have eight levels of growth.
You should try to develop them fully.
▶Igor
I'm sure that there will be an ample
reward for doing so...
▶Igor
You might also be interested to know
about various factors in fusion.
▶Igor
For example, even when creating the
same Persona...
▶Igor
The combination of spell cards, the
affinities of the demons used...
▶Igor
The position of Terra and Luna, and any
essences added into the mix...
▶Igor
All of these factor into the resultant
Persona. And one more thing...
▶Igor
You may also add an item into the
fusion to trigger a change.
▶Igor
There are some items for which the
result is easily predictable...
▶Igor
But sometimes, even I will be unable
to guess at what may happen.
▶Igor
Should that come about, I do hope that
you'll pardon me.
▶Igor
But make no mistake, I do believe it
is worth trying...
▶Igor
I suggest gems for obtaining a higher-
or lower-ranked fusion within an order.
▶Igor
As for the other items' effects, you
should experiment for yourself.▶Bizarre-looking man
My name is Igor... I am delighted to
make your acquaintance.
▶Igor
This place exists between dream and
reality, mind and matter...
▶Igor
It's been quite some time since we last
had a guest.
▶Igor
This is a room that only those bound by
a "contract" may enter...
▶Igor
From this day forth, you will be our
guest in this Velvet Room.

your power...

affinities of the demons used...
▶Igor
The position of Terra and Luna, and any
essences added into the mix...
▶Igor
All of these factor into the resultant
Persona. And one more thing...
▶Igor
You may also add an item into the
fusion to trigger a change.
▶Igor
There are some items for which the
result is easily predictable...
▶Igor
But sometimes, even I will be unable
to guess at what may happen.
▶Igor
Should that come about, I do hope that
you'll pardon me.
▶Igor
But make no mistake, I do believe it
is worth trying...
▶Igor
I suggest gems for obtaining a higher-
or lower-ranked fusion within an order.
▶Igor
As for the other items' effects, you
should experiment for yourself.▶Bizarre-looking man
My name is Igor... I am delighted to
make your acquaintance.
▶Igor
This place exists between dream and
reality, mind and matter...
▶Igor
It's been quite some time since we last
had a guest.
▶Igor
This is a room that only those bound by
a "contract" may enter...
▶Igor
From this day forth, you will be our
guest in this Velvet Room.
▶Igor
Your destiny will require you to hone
your power...
▶Igor
And for that, you will inevitably
require our help.
▶Igor
The Velvet Room is also known as the
room of Personas.
▶Igor
A Persona is a side of you that shows
itself when you face the world...
▶Igor
Think of it as a facade of protection
you wear to face hardships in life.
▶Igor
Hm... Perhaps that may have been rather
difficult to understand...
▶Igor
To battle opponents that cannot be
dealt with by human strength alone...
▶Igor
We in this room will lend you inhuman
power... The power of demons...
▶Igor
Now then. Allow me to explain my role
here...
▶Igor
I will assist you in giving birth to
new Personas.
▶Igor
The demons contained within the |ԏspell
cards|  you hold will be fused as one...
▶Igor
Thereby creating a new Persona.
▶Igor
Should you find yourselves with these
cards, please do bring them here.
  ▶Igor
Welcome to the Velvet Room...
   ▶Igor
What is it you desire?
▶Igor
Well then, what would you like
to know?
Ԡ
  ▶Igor
I'm afraid you don't have enough |ԏspell
cards|  to give birth to a new Persona.
▶Igor
Alas, we cannot look after any more
Personas.
   ▶Igor
What would you like to do?Ԟ
▶Igor
Well then... Farewell...
▶Igor
If it's new Personas you want, I shall
fuse and create them for you.
▶Igor
First, though, I must summon demons to
fuse together into a Persona.
▶Igor
And for that, a certain type of card
is necessary.
▶Igor
You see, these cards are inscribed with
demon-summoning spells.
▶Igor
They are known as spell cards, and all
demons carry one.
▶Igor
Thus, in order to perform a fusion, I
will need you to gather spell cards.
▶Igor
Go forth, negotiate with demons,
and bring these spell cards back here.
▶Igor
Combat is not the only way to deal
with demons... Do you understand?
▶Igor
And not all demons are necessarily
wishing for a fight...
 ▶Igor
It isn't enough merely to fuse a new
Persona in order to make it your own...
▶Igor
There is rather more to it than that,
I'm afraid.
▶Igor
You must take a Persona onto yourself
in order to use its power.
▶Igor
Each of you is capable of holding up
to three Personas.
▶Igor
A newly-fused Persona will be entrusted
into my care.
▶Igor
By all means let me know when you
would like to take on new Personas.
▶Igor
But I can only look after 16 Personas
at a time, mind you.
▶Igor
There are as many Personas as there are
personalities... an infinite variety.
▶Igor
Each has its own form and substance,
to be used according to the situation.
▶Igor
If you can master that principle,
you will make a fine Persona-user.
▶Igor
Each of you can take on as many as
three Personas at once.
▶Igor
Of the three, only one can be actively
invoked during battle.
▶Igor
To invoke a Persona is to summon it
in combat.
▶Igor
The remaining two will remain on
standby...
▶Igor
Ready to be assumed at any time
during battle.
▶Igor
Different active Personas will grant
you different abilities.
▶Igor
Without the power of Persona, you are
no different than an ordinary human...
▶Igor
You will be powerless before the arcane
might of the demons' spells.
▶Igor
If by chance you were hit by a spell in
that state, you would be struck down.
▶Igor
But by taking on a Persona, your defense
against spells is considerably enhanced.
▶Igor
For some, it may also confer strength,
or increase luck for others.
▶Igor
This, too, is the power of Persona.
▶Igor
Though they are called Personas, each
is a hidden side of yourself.
▶Igor
I suggest you examine your status
carefully after assuming one.
▶Igor
That way, you can see which of your
qualities have changed.
▶Igor
At first, you will be unable to harness
your Persona's powers to the fullest.
▶Igor
But the more you invoke a Persona,
the more powers it will grant you.
▶Igor
As your Persona learns new skills, you
will have more options in battle.
▶Igor
Even if your Persona learns a powerful
skill, the SP required remains constant.
▶Igor
You will grow in combat, but do not
forget that your Personas grow as well.
▶Igor
Pardon me for being nosy, but...
▶Igor
Personas have eight levels of growth.
You should try to develop them fully.
▶Igor
I'm sure that there will be an ample
reward for doing so...
▶Igor
You might also be interested to know
about various factors in fusion.
▶Igor
For example, even when creating the
same Persona...
▶Igor
The combination of spell cards, the
affinities of the demons used...
▶Igor
The position of Terra and Luna, and any
essences added into the mix...
▶Igor
All of these factor into the resultant

This, too, is the power of Persona.
▶Igor
Though they are called Personas, each
is a hidden side of yourself.
▶Igor
I suggest you examine your status
carefully after assuming one.
▶Igor
That way, you can see which of your
qualities have changed.
▶Igor
At first, you will be unable to harness
your Persona's powers to the fullest.
▶Igor
But the more you invoke a Persona,
the more powers it will grant you.
▶Igor
As your Persona learns new skills, you
will have more options in battle.
▶Igor
Even if your Persona learns a powerful
skill, the SP required remains constant.
▶Igor
You will grow in combat, but do not
forget that your Personas grow as well.
▶Igor
Pardon me for being nosy, but...
▶Igor
Personas have eight levels of growth.
You should try to develop them fully.
▶Igor
I'm sure that there will be an ample
reward for doing so...
▶Igor
You might also be interested to know
about various factors in fusion.
▶Igor
For example, even when creating the
same Persona...
▶Igor
The combination of spell cards, the
affinities of the demons used...
▶Igor
The position of Terra and Luna, and any
essences added into the mix...
▶Igor
All of these factor into the resultant
Persona. And one more thing...
▶Igor
You may also add an item into the
fusion to trigger a change.
▶Igor
There are some items for which the
result is easily predictable...
▶Igor
But sometimes, even I will be unable
to guess at what may happen.
▶Igor
Should that come about, I do hope that
you'll pardon me.
▶Igor
But make no mistake, I do believe it
is worth trying...
▶Igor
I suggest gems for obtaining a higher-
or lower-ranked fusion within an order.
▶Igor
As for the other items' effects, you
should experiment for yourself.▶Bizarre-looking man
My name is Igor... I am delighted to
make your acquaintance.
▶Igor
This place exists between dream and
reality, mind and matter...
▶Igor
It's been quite some time since we last
had a guest.
▶Igor
This is a room that only those bound by
a "contract" may enter...
▶Igor
From this day forth, you will be our
guest in this Velvet Room.
▶Igor
Your destiny will require you to hone
your power...
▶Igor
And for that, you will inevitably
require our help.
▶Igor
The Velvet Room is also known as the
room of Personas.
▶Igor
A Persona is a side of you that shows
itself when you face the world...
▶Igor
Think of it as a facade of protection
you wear to face hardships in life.
▶Igor
Hm... Perhaps that may have been rather
difficult to understand...
▶Igor
To battle opponents that cannot be
dealt with by human strength alone...
▶Igor
We in this room will lend you inhuman
power... The power of demons...
▶Igor
Now then. Allow me to explain my role
here...
▶Igor
I will assist you in giving birth to
new Personas.
▶Igor
The demons contained within the |ԏspell
cards|  you hold will be fused as one...
▶Igor
Thereby creating a new Persona.
▶Igor
Should you find yourselves with these
cards, please do bring them here.
  ▶Igor
Welcome to the Velvet Room...
   ▶Igor
What is it you desire?
▶Igor
Well then, what would you like
to know?
Ԡ
  ▶Igor
I'm afraid you don't have enough |ԏspell
cards|  to give birth to a new Persona.
▶Igor
Alas, we cannot look after any more
Personas.
   ▶Igor
What would you like to do?Ԟ
▶Igor
Well then... Farewell...
▶Igor
If it's new Personas you want, I shall
fuse and create them for you.
▶Igor
First, though, I must summon demons to
fuse together into a Persona.
▶Igor
And for that, a certain type of card
is necessary.
▶Igor
You see, these cards are inscribed with
demon-summoning spells.
▶Igor
They are known as spell cards, and all
demons carry one.
▶Igor
Thus, in order to perform a fusion, I
will need you to gather spell cards.
▶Igor
Go forth, negotiate with demons,
and bring these spell cards back here.
▶Igor
Combat is not the only way to deal
with demons... Do you understand?
▶Igor
And not all demons are necessarily
wishing for a fight...
 ▶Igor
It isn't enough merely to fuse a new
Persona in order to make it your own...
▶Igor
There is rather more to it than that,
I'm afraid.
▶Igor
You must take a Persona onto yourself
in order to use its power.
▶Igor
Each of you is capable of holding up
to three Personas.
▶Igor
A newly-fused Persona will be entrusted
into my care.
▶Igor
By all means let me know when you
would like to take on new Personas.
▶Igor
But I can only look after 16 Personas
at a time, mind you.
▶Igor
There are as many Personas as there are
personalities... an infinite variety.
▶Igor
Each has its own form and substance,
to be used according to the situation.
▶Igor
If you can master that principle,
you will make a fine Persona-user.
▶Igor
Each of you can take on as many as
three Personas at once.
▶Igor
Of the three, only one can be actively
invoked during battle.
▶Igor
To invoke a Persona is to summon it
in combat.
▶Igor
The remaining two will remain on
standby...
▶Igor
Ready to be assumed at any time
during battle.
▶Igor
Different active Personas will grant
you different abilities.
▶Igor
Without the power of Persona, you are
no different than an ordinary human...
▶Igor
You will be powerless before the arcane
might of the demons' spells.
▶Igor
If by chance you were hit by a spell in
that state, you would be struck down.
▶Igor
But by taking on a Persona, your defense
against spells is considerably enhanced.
▶Igor
For some, it may also confer strength,
or increase luck for others.
▶Igor
This, too, is the power of Persona.
▶Igor
Though they are called Personas, each
is a hidden side of yourself.
▶Igor
I suggest you examine your status
carefully after assuming one.
