▶Agastya Tree
Young ones... Your presence is welcome.
 ▶Agastya Tree
Will you inscribe your story on me? 
   ▶Agastya Tree
Take care on your journey, young ones...▶Ayase
Owww...
▶Ayase
Huh? Uh... where am I?
 ▶Yukino
Hey... This is the courtyard! What the
hell's going on here!?
 ▶Ayase
Whoa! Look!
▶Yukino
Ms. Saeko!
▶Yukino
What the--!?
  ▶Ms. Saeko
Hahaha... Finally! I've been waiting
so long!
  ▶Yukino
Ms. Saeko...?
 ▶Ms. Saeko
Saeko? Oh... I see what's happening.
▶Ms. Saeko
Poor Saeko... Hahahah.
▶Yukino
Huh? But you are Saeko!
▶Yukino
Are you okay!? Did you trip and hit
your head or something?
  ▶Ms. Saeko
Hahaha... "I wore it, and I'm okay," eh?
▶Ms. Saeko
Teeheehee... Ahahaha! That's the Saeko
I remember so well.
▶Ms. Saeko
Self-confident... self-centered...
▶Ms. Saeko
She'd step on anyone to get to be the
center of attention.
  ▶Yukino
What's wrong with you!?
▶Yukino
Stop with the jokes, 'cause they
aren't funny!
   ▶Ms. Saeko
Jokes?
▶Ms. Saeko
Look around you. Hahaha... you think
this is a joke?
▶Ms. Saeko
Beautiful, isn't it? A peaceful,
perfectly still landscape.
▶Ms. Saeko
You'll all be dressed in ice and stay
beautiful forever.
▶Ms. Saeko
So come on over...
▶Ayase
What are you saying!?
▶Ayase
You're our teacher! This is just...
  ▶Ms. Saeko
Oh, what a lovely girl.
▶Ms. Saeko
Hahaha... Come closer, girl, and I'll
give you ageless beauty.
 ▶Yukino
Don't do it, Yuka!
▶Yukino
It's the mask... It must have taken
her over!
▶Yukino
Okay, monster, you lay one finger on
Ms. Saeko and your ass is grass!
  ▶Mask
"Taken her over"? That's not very nice.
▶Mask
Tell me, who was it who undid the seal
on the mask?
▶Mask
Who put it on without thinking twice?
▶Mask
Not to mention... isn't it rude to go
around calling people monsters?
▶Mask
I think I'd prefer... the Snow Queen.
Very fitting for this mask, isn't it?
▶Snow Queen
Hahaha...
  ▶Yukino
Can it! What do you want with Ms. Saeko!?
 ▶Snow Queen
What a reckless young lady. Your teacher
is going to be... a sacrifice.
   ▶Ayase
A... A sacrifice?
  ▶Snow Queen
Yes, that's right.
▶Snow Queen
Saeko is so full of hope. If I offer her
as a sacrifice...
▶Snow Queen
The stillness of despair--the Eternal
Night--is sure to descend.
  ▶Ayase
Huh...?
▶Ayase
Does that mean everyone's gonna get
frozen? I hate being cold!
 ▶Yukino
That's not gonna happen! I'm taking back
Ms. Saeko, right now!
▶Snow Queen
Well, aren't you brave? Fine... you can
have her.
▶Snow Queen
But Saeko will stay frozen as long as
she has this mask on.
▶Snow Queen
So will the school.
▶Snow Queen
And don't think you can leave. You'll see
what I mean if you walk around a little.
▶Snow Queen
There's no escape.
▶Snow Queen
You only have two choices...
▶Snow Queen
Welcome the Eternal Night, or take the
mask off Saeko.
 ▶Ayase
Okay, but like, how do we do that?
 ▶Snow Queen
Hahaha, keep fighting it. Nothing's more
beautiful than despair after a struggle.
▶Snow Queen
I can't wait to bask in your beautiful
despair...
  ▶Ayase
Hey! I asked you a question!
   ▶Yukino
*gasp* Ms. Saeko!
 ▶Snow Queen's voice
Hahaha... Watch it, or Saeko and the mask
will both shatter into smithereens.
▶Snow Queen's voice
I have a few rituals to perform, so there
is still time before the Eternal Night.
▶Snow Queen's voice
Why don't we pass the time with a game?
 ▶Yukino
A game!?
  ▶Snow Queen's voice
This school is now a castle of ice. There
are three towers, each with a guardian.
▶Snow Queen's voice
If you can defeat them before the clocks
in each tower strikes twelve...
▶Snow Queen's voice
I'll turn Saeko and the school back
to normal.
▶Snow Queen's voice
I must leave this mask now and prepare
to call down the Eternal Night.
▶Snow Queen's voice
I hope you enjoy yourselves while I'm
gone. Hahaha... I'll see you later.
▶Ayase
Hey, wait! Don't leave...!
▶Ayase
Omigod... Wh-What're we gonna do!?
  ▶Ayase
This is all your fault, <FirstName>!
▶Ayase
If you never found that stupid mask,
this wouldn't have happened!
▶Ayase
You better own up! Are you a man or
not!? Say something!
  ▶Yukino
Stop it, Yuka! Pointing fingers won't
help the situation any.
▶Yukino
It's not like <FirstName> knew what was
gonna happen.
▶Ayase
But Yukino...
  ▶Ayase
Whoa! What was that!?
  ▶Yukino
That thing again...
   ▶Ayase
Huh...? "Again"?
> Obtained Ẅ♀|ԍMirror Frame| 
 ▶Yukino
So our job's to find the Mirror Shards
and put them in this frame, huh?
   ▶Ayase
Umm, Yukino? You know the towers are
guarded by demons, right?
▶Ayase
Aren't we a little, y'know, shorthanded?
▶Yukino
You can stay here if you want.
▶Yukino
We won't force you to come, not when we
don't know what we're up against.
 ▶Ayase
Uh, no, I meant... It's just...
▶Yukino
I'll do whatever it takes to save
Ms. Saeko.
▶Yukino
I used to be a lousy delinquent. Even my
parents gave up on me... but not her.
▶Yukino
She never gave up on me. Ever.
▶Yukino
Now it's my turn to help her, and my...
expertise can be put to a good cause.
   ▶Ayase
Hey, Yukino...
▶Ayase
You're not planning on leaving me here
all alone, are you...?
▶Ayase
'Cause I'm going with you! I feel much
safer around you and <FirstName>.
▶Yukino
Haha, sure... whatever floats your boat.
▶Yukino
If we get stuck in a bad situation,
I'm sure you'll help lighten the mood.
  ▶Yukino
Hey! Holy crap, Yuka, where did you get
a gun!?
   ▶Ayase
Kei gave it to me. Him and Masao went
to the police station for some weapons.
▶Ayase
But Kei got hurt, so they came back
to school.
▶Ayase
He handed me some guns and said to hold
on to them while he went to the nurse...
▶Ayase
So I kept one for myself!
▶Ayase
Hehehe... I always wanted to try shooting
one of these things!
 ▶Yukino
......
▶Ayase
Gah! The wind's picking up! Brrrr, it's
cooooold... My ears hurt!
▶Ayase
C'mon, let's go inside, quick!
   ▶Yukino
Yeah, standing here won't do anyone
any good.
▶Yukino
Y'think the three of us can handle the
demons and get those |ԏMirror Shards| ...?
▶Yukino
I dunno, maybe we should grab a couple
more people, like Yuka said.
 ▶Ayase
Sure, sure, but let's get inside!
I'm freezing to death here!
  ▶Yukino
Ms. Saeko... We'll be back for you.▶Nurse Natsumi
Don't you take off that bandage, Kei!
Your wound will reopen!
  ▶Nanjo
No worries. The way that bandage was
applied, it served no purpose anyway.
 ▶Nurse Natsumi
Hmph... Excuse me for being a little
bit of a butterfingers.
   ▶Nanjo
Well, if you'll excuse me...
   ▶Nurse Natsumi
Wait, what are you doing? Don't tell me
you're going outside...!
   ▶Female student
Yeah, c'mon, Kei. You're just gonna get
hurt again.
▶Female student
Besides... We've been all over campus
and we couldn't find any ways out.
▶Female student
We can't leave the school!
≻♀>ࡣઐઑਪઓ(ਸઔઅક ઑਪઓ)
▶Nanjo
Hm? What are you babbling about? This
isn't the time to share your daydreams.
  ▶Ayase
She's not! It's totally true! The Snow
Queen's trapped us all in here.
 ▶Nanjo
The Snow Queen? Is it April 1st already?
You can devise a better lie than that.
▶Nanjo
I haven't time to waste on fools. Now,
kindly step aside.
  ▶Yukino
She's right, Kei. There's no exit.
▶Nanjo
Yukino, not you too--
▶Nanjo
Wait... Has the phenomenon we saw at
the hospital reoccurred here!?
  ▶Elly
I'm afraid so.
▶Elly
With one important difference...
▶Elly
There are no demons here, but no way
out either.
  ▶Yukino
You got it. On the bright side, it's not
swarming with demons...
▶Yukino
But the bad news is there's no way out.
 ▶Nanjo
...I'm concerned for Masao and Maki.
I must get outside at any cost.
   ▶Setsuko Sonomura
Maki...
▶Setsuko Sonomura
Is there really no exit? I wonder if
there's something we can do...
  ▶Yukino
Turns out, there is. But we need help.
▶Nanjo
What do you mean?
  ▶Ayase
Okay, here goes...
 ▶Nanjo
Hm. I see.
▶Nanjo
If we save Ms. Saeko from this so-called
Snow Queen, the school will be restored.
   ▶Nanjo
And you're expecting my help?ԏ
▶Yukino
Are you sure you want Kei's help,
<FirstName>? 
▶Nanjo
Very well.
▶Nanjo
If you insist, I suppose I can lend a
hand. We'll take care of this, then Maki.
 ▶Nanjo
Very well.
▶Nanjo
If you insist, I suppose I can lend a
hand. We'll take care of this, then Maki.
▶Nanjo
Incidentally, I heard there was a
disturbance at the |ԏcafeteria| .
▶Nanjo
We may find a clue there.
   ▶Nanjo
Suits me. I'll find a way out on my own.▶Elly
How goes it, Tsutomu? Did you discover
anything?
▶Tsutomu
Eeeheehee... Of course, Eriko.
▶Tsutomu
This temperature ... ... ... ... 
is not due to a cold front!
▶Tsutomu
I'm 90% sure.
  ▶Elly
......
  ▶Tsutomu
I'm sorry...
▶Tsutomu
But I came up empty. None of the books
mention this kind of thing at all.
 ▶Elly
Oh... is that so?
▶Elly
Then I'll keep up my own search. I'm very
intrigued by this door...
▶Elly
That writing is Greek for "|ԏNemesis Tower| ."
  ▶Tsutomu
Nemesis? Hmm... Greek, you say?
Iiiiiinteresting...
  ▶Elly
Nemesis is the Greek goddess of
retribution.
▶Yukino
Hey, Tsutomu knows tons about the occult
and demons and stuff.
▶Yukino
Wouldn't he be pretty useful? Someone like
him would be a big plus, I think.
  ▶Nanjo
That's not a bad idea. We're frankly
lacking in information on demons.
▶Nanjo
As Sun Tzu said, "Know both yourself and
your enemy."
   ▶Ayase
Whaaaat!? I don't wanna sound mean,
but... he's not my type.
▶Ayase
I say no.
 ▶Yukino
That's your idea of "not being mean"?
▶Yukino
Who cares whether he's your type!?
▶Yukino
Though I gotta admit... he looks more
than a little flaky.
 ▶Ayase
Hey, how 'bout Eriko? She might be able
to translate if we meet foreign demons.
▶Yukino
Hmm... You know, she does seem to know
about that stuff. Yeah, that could work.
   ▶Elly
Excuse me, but... what were you talking
about just now?
▶Elly
I didn't mean to eavesdrop, but I heard
my name come up.
 ▶Yukino
Oh, we were just saying you probably
know a lot about demons.
▶Yukino
Here's what's going on...
  ▶Elly
Ahh, so that's how the school became
encased in ice. Fascinating...
▶Elly
I love stories of monsters and ghosts,
but this...
▶Elly
I never imagined I'd witness multiple
supernatural events, one after another.
  ▶Elly
Something must be done before it's
too late.ԏ
  ▶Yukino
You're sure you want Eriko to help? 
 ▶Elly
All right!
▶Elly
Let's search for the |ԏMirror Shards|  and
save Ms. Saeko.
▶Elly
All right!
▶Elly
Let's search for the |ԏMirror Shards|  and
save Ms. Saeko.
▶Elly
By the way, I heard something happened
at the |ԏcafeteria| . Have you been yet?
 ▶Elly
If there's anything I can do to help,
please don't hesitate to ask.▶Brown
H-Hey, Toro! I'm sorry for hiding the
food from you...
▶Brown
Just please don't eat any more! You're
gonna waste it all!
  ▶Male student
I'm sorry, man. I thought if you found
it, you'd gobble it all up.
▶Male student
The whole school's in trouble! We have to
ration the food! You gotta understand...
▶Toro
Sh-Shut up! Why's everyone make fun
of me!?
▶Toro
I know you were sharing the food without
telling me! That's it, this food's mine!
≻♂> Kenta Yokouchi (Nickname: Toro)
His love of food has made him physically
strong, but emotionally fragile.≻ 
   ▶Brown
Nooo! Our precious, precious food!
▶Brown
One guy goes crazy from rejection and
we all starve to death now?
▶Brown
How can my charmed life end this way!?
▶Brown
Croaking alongside a fatso...
  ▶Toro
AAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH!
▶Toro
Y-Y-Y-Y-YOU SAID THE F-WORD!
DON'T CALL ME FAT!
▶Toro
DAMN YOU ALL!
▶Toro
I'm gonna eat and eat and eat before
I die! I'll stuff myself!
▶Toro
Then I'll watch the rest of you collapse
one by one!
▶Toro
Ahahahahahahahahaha!
▶Male student
H-Hey, Brown... he's completely lost it.
What do we do?
 ▶Brown
D-Don't ask me!
▶Brown
Man, Yuka, this is all your fault for
rejecting him!
   ▶Ayase
Excuse me!? What's with blaming me for
this all of a sudden!?
  ▶Yukino
Only one thing to do... knock the poor
bastard out cold.
  ▶Toro
Hahahahahahaha...
No way! Not gonna happen!
▶Toro
Wanna know why? 'Cause the butterfly
gave me a demon!
▶Toro
I'm not just a butterball anymore, Yuka!
Ahahahahahahaha!
   ▶Brown
Uh... a demon? Wow, sounds like his mind
snapped along with his heart.
 ▶Elly
What!? Does he mean a Persona...?
   ▶Male student
I'll grab a teacher! Keep an eye on him,
I'll be right back!
▶Toro
Ahahahahahahaha! No one can stop me now!
▶Nanjo
Kenta! You must calm down!
▶Nanjo
Once the city returns to normal, I'll
treat you to our chef's special dishes!
   ▶Ayase
Toro, why're you doing this!?
▶Ayase
You're like, making me look like the
bad guy here!
   ▶Toro
Aaaah, my darling Yuka!
▶Toro
I'll save you, and only you... if you
promise to go out with me.
▶Toro
I'll even save you some food!
▶Toro
Ahahahahahaha!
  ▶Ayase
Uh-uh. No way. Not in a million years.
 ▶Toro
AAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH...!
▶Toro
DAMMIT! DAMMIT, DAMMIT, DAMMIT!
I'M... I'M... AAAAAAAHHHHHH...!
   ▶Yukino
D-Don't get him mad! You're too blunt,
Yuka...
▶Yukino
I bet you were just as cold to him when
he said he loved you!
 ▶Ayase
Eh, not really. I just told him the truth.
▶Ayase
All I said was, like...
 ▶Brown
Hey, Boss!
▶Brown
I don't think he'll come to his senses
without a swift kick in the butt.
▶Yukino
Who're you calling "Boss"!? Tch, you're
such a clown...
▶Yukino
Sure, I'll try that if nothing
else works.
▶Yukino
For now, let's buy us some time until
the teacher gets here!
▶Yukino
Hey Hidehiko, you listening?
▶Yukino
Quit standing around and give us a hand!
 ▶Brown
Mwahahaha... I'll follow you to the
ends of the earth!
 ▶Brown
Oh man... What have you done!?
▶Brown
Quick, apologize! It's not too late!
Say you're sorry!
  ▶Nanjo
Small wonder Kenta was furious. As they
say, "All evil comes from the mouth"...
▶Nanjo
You went too far, Yuka. Apologize to him!
  ▶Ayase
I did? Really!?
▶Ayase
Uh, did the truth really hurt that bad,
Toro?
  ▶Toro
*sob* My darling Yuka...
How could you...?
▶Toro
You'll pay for stomping all over my pure,
innocent heart...
▶Toro
Mr. Demon... Oh, Mr. Demon! Come out!
▶Toro
Come out and punish the people who keep
making fun of me!
▶Toro
Bimble...  Bumble...  Bambob-bun...
▶Brown
Whoa whoa whoa, what's the chanting
about? This isn't some manga...
▶Ayase
Huh? What's with the chanting? You're in
high school!
▶Ayase
Stop dreaming about Mr. Demon and...
 ▶Toro
Unh... Uuuuuunnnnggggghhh!
It's coming out!▶Ayase
Okay, what's this super important thing
you had to tell me? I'm, like, busy!
   ▶Toro
Y-Y-Yuka...
▶Toro
Um... um... I'm, um, I'm sorry for,
um, asking you to meet me here.
  ▶Ayase
Geez, speak up already! If you're not
saying anything, I'm out. Seeya!
 ▶Toro
W-Wait! There is something! I'll tell
you right now.
▶Toro
...Are you ready?
   ▶Ayase
Like, spit it out already! I got people
waiting on me!
 ▶Toro
...Yuka... I... I l-l-l-l...
  ▶Ayase
You... what?
   ▶Toro
I LOVE YOOOOOOOOU! I ...Ջ
I LOVE YOU SOOOOO MUUUUUCH!
▶Toro
P-P-P-P-Please go out with me!
▶Toro
I p-p-p-promise I'll make you hippy...Ԛ
I, I mean, happy.
▶Toro
*pant* *pant*
 ▶Ayase
.Ԛ.Ԛ.Ԛ.Ԛ.Ԛ.ԚNo. Way. Like, have you even seen
yourself in a mirror?
▶Ayase
Alright, I'm out. Laters.
▶Toro
W-Wait! Please!
▶Toro
Why not? What's so bad about me?
 ▶Ayase
Let's see, you're fat, slow, wear the same
clothes every day, laugh at everything...
▶Ayase
And I've never seen you do anything but
eat, sleep, and read manga.
▶Ayase
I like, don't get what keeps you going.
Everything about you sucks!
   ▶Toro
H-How can you be so mean...?
▶Toro
Well... what do YOU like, Yuka?
▶Toro
You laugh when you aren't happy, you hang
out with people you think are stupid...
▶Toro
Are you scared to be alone?
 ▶Ayase
Sh-Shut up!
▶Ayase
Stop acting like you got it all figured
out, butterball!
   ▶Toro
B... Butterball...?▶Agastya Tree
Young ones... Your presence is welcome.
 ▶Agastya Tree
Will you inscribe your story on me? 
   ▶Agastya Tree
Take care on your journey, young ones...▶Brown
Whaaa...? Something just came outta me
to say hi.
  ▶Ayase
What in the world was that...?
 ▶Nanjo
Those things? I decided to call them
Personas.
 ▶Elly
They don't seem to be hostile; at least,
not for now.
   ▶Yukino
Looks like our little squad's getting
bigger.
 ▶Brown
Uh... squad?
   ▶Ayase
Huh?
▶Ayase
You mean you and <FirstName> are like,
you know... and stuff?
   ▶Nanjo
I'm... not sure what you're trying
to say, but...
▶Nanjo
There's definitely a commonality
between us.
 ▶Yukino
Yeah, after we had those weird dreams,
we can summon... Personas, was it?
 ▶Elly
For some reason, only those who dreamed
of the butterfly acquired the power.
▶Elly
It also seems related to the demon
invasion somehow...
  ▶Ayase
Wait a sec, Toro was using a Persona,
right? Did he have that dream, too?
  ▶Nanjo
If he could summon his Persona, then one
assumes so.
   ▶Elly
Yes, that's the most likely explanation.
▶Ayase
Omigod!
▶Ayase
I don't believe it! No... no, it
can't be!
▶Ayase
That thing's gonna come out of my tummy,
and I'll go berserk!?
  ▶Elly
Er... I don't think so. It's all in how
you use it. Take a knife, for example.
▶Elly
It can be a valuable tool in the kitchen,
or a weapon on the battlefield.
▶Elly
What it does is determined by its user.
  ▶Nanjo
I doubt it. The power's application
varies between each individual.
▶Nanjo
Dynamite can kill, but it can also be
used to blast open a tunnel.
▶Nanjo
It essentially boils down to how its
user chooses to apply it.
▶Nanjo
If you use this power for personal gain,
you'll reap what you sow.
   ▶Brown
Alright... I should be fine, then.
▶Brown
Oh, duh! I know exactly what that
butterfly wants me to do!
▶Brown
It made me a hero so I could save the
school--and the city!
▶Brown
Haha, alright... If you guys really
need me thaaaat much...
▶Brown
I guess I can pitch in. Follow my lead!
 ▶Nanjo
How naive...
   ▶Yukino
Well, if he wants to come, fine with us.
  ▶Yukino
Right, <FirstName>? 
   ▶Ayase
<FirstName>... you really, actually want
Hidehiko along? 
   ▶Brown
Say what!?
▶Brown
C'mon, guys! I know you all want me
tagging along! No need to hide it!
  ▶Brown
C'mon, be real!
▶Brown
Miz Yukino here begged me to join!
How can I say no to that?
▶Brown
Plus, I heard it's your fault the school
is in this mess.
▶Brown
With me as leader, we can't lose!
Trust me!
▶Brown
Mwahahahaha...
  ▶Yukino
What are you doing?
▶Yukino
Quit moping around! We're leaving!
   ▶Brown

blowing from beyond.

Hee-ho!

We transferred to this hee-school from
Devil's Peak-ho behind that door.
▶Reiho
Hee-ho! It's hee-so cool and comfy-ho
over here.

School is pretty fun, isn't it, Reiho?
▶Reiho
Yeah... it's all right, ho.

Human girls aren't cold like that, ho!
▶Reiho
They aren't? Sounds hee-hard...
  ▶Raiho
Hee-ho!
▶Raiho
Every time you finish a tower, a door hee-
hopens at Devil's Peak! I wonder why...
▶Reiho
The mountain has problems too, ho.
You know... like a midlife crisis.
▶Raiho
Hee-huh? Well, anyways, that's how the
doors open, ho!
▶Reiho
Hee... Nothing cool has happened
lately.
▶Raiho
Hee-ho! Wanna light the school on
fire, ho? Burn, baby, burn!
▶Reiho
Hey, hee-don't be so reckless.
That'll make this place too hee-hot.
 ▶Yukino
What a creepy-looking door.
   ▶Yukino
Who the hell built snowmen here!?
 ▶Yukino
My toes are getting numb.
▶Yukino
Stupid Drama Club! Why'd the Snow Queen
have to be their traditional play?
▶Yukino
Why not A Midsummer Night's Dream?
I hate the cold...
  ▶Ayase
Whoa... that door looks like demons
could come out of it any minute.
   ▶Ayase
Omigosh! Look at those dolls!
They're, like, sooooo cute!
  ▶Ayase
We're not done here yet?

better part of valor."

It's not my business, but those children
look pale. They need more iron.
   ▶Brown
Hey, check out those weirdos!
▶Brown
They keep saying, "Hee-ho, hee-ho."
  ▶Brown
I talked to 'em a little... Man, they've
been through some hard times.

And they're still so young! It's enough
to bring me to tears... *sniff*

Oh! Jack Frosts!

Careful... Their outwardly adorable
appearance is a ruse to lure people in.

freeze their unsuspecting prey!

the same coin. Be careful!

How many |ԏMirror Shards|  we got so far?
Can I see the frame?

Um, okay. But I think we should check
every once in a while.

The Snow Queen's power seems to be weaker

shut should now be open to you.

the three towers surrounding this school.

Of the three, this tower has the simplest
structure.

to find the Mirror Shards there.

Once you set foot in a tower, you cannot
leave until you defeat its master.

Oh, uh, sorry. That was meant for this
loudmouth over here.
   ▶Tadashi
Two people, seeing the same dream at

It can't be a coincidence! Clearly,
we were meant for each other.

I see myself in your eyes...

Uh... could you excuse us, please?

At least he has someone to argue with.

That doesn't sound so scary, does it?

Ugh! If I never see Michiko again, it'll
be too soon.

The hospital was all messed up inside,
just like the school, right?

You think my house is okay? I don't wanna
see some demon kickin' it in the den.

Michiko was really something. I'm gonna
be seeing her in my nightmares...

How dismal.

Hm? My scarf's on crooked? Ah, thanks
for that.

Hey, uh, how about we stop talking about

It's so cold... At this rate, we'll all

What the... Who's that on the floor?
▶Yukino
Tadashi and Tamaki!? And Nurse Natsumi!
▶Yukino
What are they doing here? Weren't they
back at school? *gasp* No way...!
   ▶Nanjo
It took some time, but regular students
are being claimed as victims...
▶Nanjo
I pity them, but there isn't time to
waste. We could be next.
  ▶Brown
Tadashi... Tamaki... Nurse Natsumi...
▶Brown
How could this happen...!?
▶Brown
Damn that Snow Queen!

I'll avenge their deaths if it's the
last thing I do!
   ▶Tadashi
Zzzz... hrnk...  lo... you...  Tamaki...!
Zzzz...
  ▶Yukino
T-Tamaki!? Is he talking in his sleep?
▶Yukino
Wait... they're all just sleeping!?
▶Yukino
Tch... well, that was a lot of panic
over nothing.
   ▶Nanjo
Hold it, Yukino.
▶Nanjo
Even if they are only sleeping, it's odd
they should be here and not at school.
▶Nanjo
It could be a trap of the Snow Queen's.
I advise keeping your guard up.
   ▶Elly
Hypnos Tower...
▶Elly
Hypnos is the god of sleep...!
▶Elly
Careful, everyone!
▶Elly
These three may have been forced into
sleep by the Snow Queen!
   ▶Tamaki
Zzzz... Mmmm...  I love you... 
da... shi...  Zzzz...
  ▶Ayase
Look at those faces, though... they seem
so happy!
▶Ayase
I dunno if the Snow Queen really has
anything to do with this.
  ▶Nurse Natsumi
Zzzz... Hahaha...  Now be a good boy... 
Clean your plate...
 ▶Ayase
Ugh... like, what's she dreaming about?
It makes me wanna pinch her nose.
  ▶Yukino
Even if they are just sleeping, we can't
leave them here surrounded by monsters.
▶Yukino
Let's wake them up before we move on.
   ▶Yukino
I dunno what to say about Nurse Natsumi.
She might as well still be sleeping.
 ▶Ayase
Y'know what?
▶Ayase
Tadashi acts up a lot, but he's not that
bad-looking when he's asleep.
▶Ayase
*yawn* I'm tired... I'm getting sleepy.
▶Nanjo
If they're not in mortal peril, it should
be fine to leave them. We don't have time.
▶Nanjo
Time is money, as they say. Let's proceed.
▶Nanjo
.. .. ..
▶Nanjo
Ugh... I have to make a conscious effort
to avoid falling asleep.
▶Nanjo
I'd like it if we could spend as little
time here as possible.
▶Brown
What, so they're just sleeping? I got
all anxious over nothing...
▶Brown
Then again, I suspected from the start
that was what was happening. Really.
  ▶Brown
.. .. .. 
... ... Guh!?
▶Brown
What!? What is it!? I-I wasn't sleeping.
Nope, not me.
▶Brown
I was subconsciously coming up with
a plan!
▶Elly
If Hypnos is, in fact, tied to their
strange slumber...
▶Elly
I doubt they'll wake up no matter how
long we wait here.
 ▶Elly
Have a firm grip on yourself and don't
fall asleep.
▶Elly
That's the key to conquering
Hypnos Tower.
   ▶Tadashi
Zzzz... *hrnk*...  I'll always hold you
close to me...
  ▶Tamaki
Zzzz...  I'll always be with you...
  ▶Nurse Natsumi
Zzzz... Mmmm...  You won't escape this
time...  Now eat up...

Hmm. The situation is more serious than
I had thought.
▶Nanjo
It's clear now that something is causing
people in the school to fall asleep.

We must locate the cause.

This is deplorable!

They're just like the people in the

None of them show any signs of waking
up anytime soon. What should we do?

We're not just gonna leave 'em here,
are we?
  ▶Ayase
Hey, like, now's our chance! Let's draw
stuff on Baldy's head!
 ▶Nanjo
Oh, for crying out loud...!
▶Nanjo
Remind me why we entered the tower...
To escape the school, correct?
▶Nanjo
Then we should ignore any distractions
from that end!
▶Nanjo
You people allow yourselves too many
unnecessary diversions.

Hmm m m m...  Alright! Listen to your
leader's decision!

We're moving on!  Although... 
Wait a minute.

If we save them, they'll owe us one.

the tower, we must make a choice.

Hey, uh, this door is kinda weird-looking.
Wanna go in?
▶Nanjo
A blatantly suspicious door like that?
It would be madness to go near it.
▶Nanjo
Though idle speculation won't help,
either... What should we do?
 ▶Elly
The door does look suspicious, but I
don't get the sense that it's dangerous.

suggestion and go through.

You presume to tell your principal that his
educational policies are wrong?
▶Principal Hanya
Is that what you're getting at, Ooishi?
   ▶Vice-Principal Ooishi
No, Mr. Hanya, I didn't mean it that way.
▶Vice-Principal Ooishi
I just think punishing students for being
tardy three times with either expulsion...
▶Vice-Principal Ooishi
...or having to shine the principal's
shoes until graduation is a bit... harsh.
 ▶Nanjo
It seems we're witnessing a shared dream
of the principal and vice-principal.
▶Nanjo
But here, the roles are reversed...
▶Nanjo
I'd wager our principal was dragged into
that arrogant vice-principal's dream.
   ▶Brown
What the... Hanya is the principal and
Ooishi is the vice-principal!?
▶Brown
What's going on here...? Ohhh, I get it!
This is what they're dreaming.
  ▶Ayase
Whaaaaat!? Baldy's our principal here?
That's like, SUPER wrong!
   ▶Principal Hanya
Excuse me, Ooishi!?
▶Principal Hanya
Did I just hear you criticize the
eminently fair rules I came up with?
▶Principal Hanya
Hmm... I think this calls for a new rule.
▶Principal Hanya
Anyone who criticizes the principal's
decisions is fired!
▶Principal Hanya
Do you hear me? Fired!
▶Vice-Principal Ooishi
"Came up with"!?
▶Vice-Principal Ooishi
Do you often "come up" with regulations
without putting any thought into them!?
   ▶Nanjo
This is utterly ridiculous. I can't
bear to watch anymore.
▶Nanjo
Should a real educator be saying this
sort of thing?
▶Elly
Vice-Principal Hanya's desire for power
must be very strong...
▶Elly
Not only does his dream reflect them,
it pulled in Ms. Ooishi...
  ▶Principal Hanya
S-Silence! What's wrong with coming up
with school rules!?
▶Principal Hanya
I'm the most important person in this
school! Why, I'm essentially a god!
▶Principal Hanya
My word is god's word, the will of the
universe! Don't you see!?

Mr. Hanya! What do you think the purpose
of education is!?

Let's hurry and wake 'em up. I can't
stand listening to this.

I gotta say, this is a realistic-looking

If you hadn't told me I was in a dream,
I wouldn'tve suspected a thing.

*sigh*... Let's get back to school.
I'm soooo tired!

encroaching on the dreams of others...

desires leaves a bad taste in my mouth.

but this is unbearable to watch...
▶Nanjo
In more ways than one.
▶Elly
Th-They seem awfully happy... Haha...
I'd rather not interfere.
 ▶Tadashi
Look me in the eyes... Do you see
yourself?
▶Tadashi
I see myself in your eyes... Ah!
We're united as one!
  ▶Tamaki
Yes... Yes! I see myself in your eyes!
▶Tamaki
And you see yourself in mine? This is
wonderful... You and I are one!
 ▶Yukino
...*sigh* They can keep at this once
they're awake.
▶Yukino
Let's wake them up already.
  ▶Yukino
Being in someone else's dream feels kinda
awkward, you know?
  ▶Ayase
Awww... Those two are like a pair of
jailbirds. I wish I could be like them.
   ▶Nanjo
It's often difficult to convey one's
true feelings to another...
▶Nanjo
Especially between a man and a woman.
Interesting, no?
▶Brown
*sob* I'm begging you, man!
▶Brown
Leave a poor, broken man alone for
a while...
▶Brown
Ahh... Tamaki...!
▶Elly
One wouldn't think to look at this room
that we were in the Dream World.
▶Tadashi
Argh! Stop bothering us! Can't you see
we're in the middle of something!?
▶Tadashi
You're really rude, you know that?
   > Pinch Tadashi? 
▶Tamaki
Stop getting in our way! If you ruin
this moment...!
  > Pinch Tamaki? 
 ▶Tadashi
Huh? Wh-What?
▶Tamaki
Huh? Wh-Why?
  ▶Tadashi
Would you please leave us alone?
 ▶Tamaki
Go away. You're getting on my nerves.▶Yukino
Huh? Who has dreams about a convenience
store?
▶Nurse Natsumi
So, what do you want for dinner tonight?
   ▶Nurse Natsumi's boyfriend
Anything's fine, as long as I have it
with you... How was that? Hahaha!
▶Nanjo
Ah, this must be Nurse Natsumi's dream.
Then I assume that's her recent ex.
▶Nanjo
He's not bad, if not quite at my own
level. None too bright, either.
   ▶Brown
Huh? Is that the guy Nurse Natsumi
just broke up with?
▶Brown
He's pretty handsome. Not like me,
but not bad.
 ▶Ayase
Whoa! Nurse Natsumi's boyfriend is,
like, smoking hot!
▶Ayase
I so wish I had an awesome guy like him.
▶Nurse Natsumi
Oh, you're so funny! Come on, what are
you in the mood for?
▶Nurse Natsumi
Let's decide quick and check out, so we
can go back home and eat.
  ▶Nurse Natsumi's boyfriend
Uh, what?
▶Nurse Natsumi's boyfriend
Didn't you tell me you were gonna cook
for me today, hon?
▶Nanjo
Wait, is she going to feed him the corner
store's ready-made meal?
▶Nanjo
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't
believe that counts as "cooking"...
▶Elly
Oh, Nurse Natsumi...
▶Elly
Don't tell me she's acting as though she
cooks the store's pre-made lunches...
▶Elly
I feel sorry for him...
   ▶Nurse Natsumi
Yeah, and I will!
▶Nurse Natsumi
I'll warm it up for you in the microwave
once we get to my place.
▶Nurse Natsumi
Oh, how about this "Surprise Cutlet
Combo"? It says it's their latest item!
▶Nurse Natsumi
Sounds delicious, doesn't it? Let's get
two of these, honey!
   ▶Nurse Natsumi's boyfriend
Uh... Y-Yeah, anything's fine. I can't
wait to dig in... Haha... ha...
 ▶Yukino
This... is painful to watch, in so many
ways. Let's wake her up and move on.
  ▶Yukino
Big surprise she got dumped, huh?
 ▶Ayase
Hey, you think eating the food in a dream
is bad for you?
  ▶Nanjo
No clerk, no other shoppers... 
▶Nanjo
This place is more unsettling than a
convenience store late at night.
  ▶Brown
I wonder if we can bring any of this food
back to the real world... What a waste.
  ▶Elly
This is fantastic!
▶Elly
To think that the human subconscious
can create such a realistic environment!
▶Elly
This convenience store looks authentic
in every respect!
 ▶Nurse Natsumi
What do you want!? Try anything funny
and I'll call for the police!
> Pinch Nurse Natsumi? 
  ▶Nurse Natsumi's boyfriend
What the hell do you want from us!?
Huh!?
  ▶Nurse Natsumi
Wh-What's happening?
   ▶Nurse Natsumi
Go away! Shoo!▶Agastya Tree
Young ones... Your presence is welcome.
 ▶Agastya Tree
Will you inscribe your story on me? 
   ▶Agastya Tree
Take care on your journey, young ones...▶Yukino
What the...?
▶Yukino
This doesn't feel like the other rooms.
Is this someone else's dream?
▶Yukino
...Huh? Someone's back there!
▶Glasses-wearing schoolgirl
Oh... We have company... What a surprise.
 ▶Robed man
Indeed it is. Shall we entertain
our guests?
   ▶Nanjo
What's going on?
▶Nanjo
She's wearing our school's uniform.
Is this her dream, then?
  ▶Brown
*whistle* She's a cutie! Hm...?
Wait a sec!
▶Brown
Oh man, she's got our school uniform on!
▶Brown
How the heck did I never notice a girl
like her!?
 ▶Ayase
Hey, what's your name? Which homeroom
are you in? Are you trapped here too?
▶Glasses-wearing schoolgirl
Heehee... Why are you people here?
▶Glasses-wearing schoolgirl
This dream is for myself alone.
▶Glasses-wearing schoolgirl
The Snow Queen entrusted me with guarding
this Hypnos Tower...
▶Glasses-wearing schoolgirl
My name is Kumi Hirose.
▶Kumi
It's very rude of you to barge into
someone else's dream.
▶Kumi
Isn't it, Sir Hypnos?
▶Hypnos
Indeed it is.
▶Hypnos
And not just anyone's dream, Kumi,
but yours. They don't know their place.
▶Hypnos
What would you have me do, Kumi?
▶Hypnos
If it's all right with you, I can teach
them a lesson.
   ▶Nanjo
The guardian of this tower...
▶Nanjo
Then you're the ones responsible for
confining people in the Dream World.
▶Nanjo
But why go about it in such a roundabout
way rather than simply kill them?
▶Nanjo
What do you intend to do with the souls
trapped in the Dream World!?
▶Elly
You're guarding this tower?
▶Elly
Then you're putting people to sleep and
keeping them in the Dream World...
▶Elly
But simply disposing of them entirely
would be simple for you.
▶Elly
Why have you chosen to imprison their
souls in the Dream World instead!?
 ▶Kumi
Heehee... You came all this way to ask
me that?
▶Kumi
But I guess it can't be helped.
▶Kumi
You're forced to live in the real world,
just like the rest.
▶Kumi
But isn't it clear that people are
happiest living inside their dreams?
▶Kumi
They can never be happy in the real
world... I'm just helping them see that.
▶Kumi
Isn't that right, Sir Hypnos?
  ▶Hypnos
Indeed it is, Kumi.
▶Hypnos
You've done nothing wrong. It's they
who are the villains.
▶Hypnos
But it's inevitable that they don't
understand you.
▶Hypnos
They have no idea what you went through
in the real world...
▶Hypnos
And the joy that filled your heart as
you came to this world of dreams.
▶Hypnos
Now, let us show them the cruelty you
faced in the real world...
▶Hypnos
And teach them the splendor of dreams!
 ▶Yukino
Huh...? Wh-What's going on!?▶Drama club president
Kumi, I've noticed you haven't been
showing up to rehearsal lately.
▶Drama club president
You have the title role in "The Snow
Queen," and you're not rehearsing?
▶Drama club president
What's the matter with you!? Everyone
else is working hard!
▶Drama club president
Do you feel even remotely guilty? Don't
you realize how important your part is!?
   ▶Drama club member
Yeah, Kumi!
▶Drama club member
You can't act like that when you won the
Snow Queen part over our president.
▶Drama club member
Aren't you getting a little full
of yourself?
 ▶Drama club member
Really, though, we do need you to come
to rehearsals.
▶Drama club member
We can only do so much with your
understudy. Talk to us, Kumi...
 ▶Kumi
Um... I've had to... s-study...
▶Kumi
My grades went down, and... my p-parents
said to forget the club... and study...
 ▶Drama club member
Oh, geez! Here we go with the class
genius's parents!
▶Drama club member
What a load of crap. You were third in
our grade for that last test, right?
▶Drama club member
How can you call that bad!?
  ▶Kumi
Um... I wasn't... n-number one...
   ▶Drama club member
Oh, give me a break! What, is that
sarcasm or something?
▶Drama club member
Just 'cause you're smarter than most
doesn't mean you can act all stuck up!
▶Drama club member
If studying's so important, then go
ahead and quit the club!
▶Drama club member
I'm not gonna mince any more words...
You've been a real pain in the ass!
▶Kumi
I... I didn't mean to...
▶Drama club president
Alright, so you've told us why you
haven't been coming.
▶Drama club president
But listen, Kumi... are you taking
this club seriously?
▶Drama club president
Do you understand how many people it
affects when you don't show up?
▶Drama club president
Do you know how much trouble it causes
when you focus on your own business?
▶Drama club president
Kumi... can you tell me what your role
is in this club?
▶Drama club president
Because if you don't know, I have to
ask you to leave.
  ▶Drama club member
Yeah, she's absolutely right! You heard
her! Get outta here!
▶Drama club member
Stupid, stuck-up dork...
▶Drama club member
Having a depressing loner like you around
brings us all down!
▶Drama club member
I'm sorry, but the president has a point.
▶Drama club member
You should think carefully, Kumi. What's
more important: your life or your grades?
   ▶Kumi
......▶Yukino
Huh... That's what made you shut yourself
up in the Dream World.
▶Yukino
...And?
 ▶Kumi
Th-That's all you can say, even after
seeing what happened? H-How dare you!?
▶Kumi
The Snow Queen... that mask immediately
understood my pain and anguish...!
▶Kumi
Y-You're just like my father and the
others in the drama club!
▶Kumi
You don't even try to understand me!
▶Hypnos
K-Kumi! You must calm yourself!
   ▶Nanjo
Oh, for heaven's sake!
▶Nanjo
You fled to the Dream World for such
absurd, trivial reasons?
▶Nanjo
That's so appalling that I'm speechless.
You're making a mockery of your own life.
▶Brown
C'mon, Kumi, aren't you taking it all
a little too seriously?
▶Brown
I mean, life's full of fun stuff!
▶Brown
You gotta take it easy! Live a little!
▶Brown
Like me!
▶Ayase
Gimme a break! You just did that so you
could brag about your awesome grades!
▶Ayase
So what if I'm stupid!? Ohhh, I cannot
BELIEVE this! I'm like, SO pissed!
▶Kumi
But... but...! What could I do?
▶Kumi
No matter what I did or didn't do, no one
gave me a hint of praise!
▶Kumi
I tried my best, really I did!
But everyone around me just...
▶Kumi
Right, Sir Hypnos!?
▶Kumi
None of it was my fault, right!?
  ▶Hypnos
Indeed, Kumi. You've done nothing wrong!
It's clear who's at fault...
 ▶Nanjo
..."The others"? Hmph, you've certainly
led an easy life.
▶Nanjo
All you do is blame "the others" for
everything while running away!
▶Nanjo
And now, tired of that, you've decided
to frolic alone in your dream?
▶Nanjo
You're a coward, too afraid to face real
life and real people.
 ▶Elly
"The others," right?
▶Elly
Your life seems very easy...
▶Elly
Any problem of yours is solved by blaming
someone else from a safe distance.
▶Elly
Are you that afraid of dealing honestly
with other people?
▶Elly
I must say, you seem rather weak and
selfish to me.
   ▶Kumi
Wh-Who do you think you are!?
▶Kumi
I'm happy now! I've never been happier!
▶Kumi
It was the Snow Queen's mask and
Sir Hypnos who saved me, no one else!
▶Kumi
For the first time in my life, I'm free,
here in the Dream World!
▶Kumi
It may not be real, but the happiness
I feel inside is!
  ▶Hypnos
It's all right! Kumi... it's all right.
▶Hypnos
Let's dispose of them.
▶Hypnos
Then we can return to the bliss of
dreams, just the two of us.
   ▶Yukino
Yyyeah... I'm gonna call that bluff.
This is the Dream World, right?
▶Yukino
Then both of you are just part of Kumi
Hirose's dream.
▶Yukino
I'm guessing the real Kumi is somewhere
else in the tower.
▶Yukino
And that means if we pinch her and wake
her up, you're history.
▶Yukino
So that's exactly what we'll do!
▶Yukino
Shake off those cobwebs and wait for
us, 'cause we're on our way!
▶Yukino
So Kumi's the boss of this tower...
▶Yukino
Bet she has a |ԏMirror Shard|  or two.
   ▶Ayase
Ooooooh! She SO gets on my nerves!
▶Ayase
Let's go kick her ass!
  ▶Nanjo
What is the matter with that girl!?
Her entire outlook on life is a joke.
▶Nanjo
I'm most irked by her idea of herself
as the only sufferer in the world.
 ▶Brown
Hmm... life is tough...
▶Brown
I'm smart and I still got problems,
so I kinda get how Kumi feels.
 ▶Elly
That Hypnos character who stood beside
Kumi...
▶Elly
I hope he's nothing more than the ideal
"Prince" of her dreams...
▶Elly
A mere figment of her imagination.
   ▶Kumi
Wh-What do you want!?
▶Kumi
If you lay even a finger on me,
Sir Hypnos will punish you!
▶Hypnos
Insolent fool! Don't you dare touch Kumi!
 > Pinch Kumi? 
   ▶Kumi
Rrgh... You...! I'll remember this!
 ▶Kumi
Hmph... g-good choice. If you'd pinched
me, you would have paid dearly.

Don't worry... No matter what happens,
I'll protect you.

Tamaki... I want you to trust me!
I love you!
 ▶Tamaki
We fought a lot, but that was because
I worried about you, Tadashi.
▶Tamaki
You're always so reckless... You probably
had no idea how I felt.
▶Tamaki
But thanks to that dream, I can admit
my feelings... I love you, Tadashi!
 ▶Yukino
Oh, here it comes... I dunno how they
can keep at it.
▶Yukino
On the plus side, all three of you are
awake. Anyone feel sick or anything?
▶Tadashi
Argh! It was just getting good! Why'd you
have to butt in!?
▶Tadashi
Right, Tamaki?
 ▶Tamaki
Yukino...? You guys... what are you
doing here?
   ▶Nanjo
They don't seem to remember anything.
Ignorance is bliss, as they say.
▶Nanjo
*sigh* I'm certainly glad we wasted our
time and effort saving them.
▶Brown
Whaaaaat!? Get real, Tamaki!
▶Brown
I went through allllll that trouble to
save you, and you don't remember a thing!?
▶Brown
Now that hurts... This sucks.
   ▶Tadashi
Remember? What the heck are you talking
about? We were... Huh? Why are we here?
▶Tadashi
I was having a nice dream, and when I
woke up... Tamaki was there...
▶Tadashi
Looking right at me...
  ▶Yukino
Alright, alright! We get it!
▶Yukino
Congrats, both of you. Just keep the
lovey-dovey crap to yourselves!
▶Yukino
I'll get out of your hair if you just
tell me one thing...
▶Yukino
Do either of you have a |ԏMirror Shard| ?
▶Yukino
It's really important.
 ▶Nanjo
Hmph. As I expected.
▶Nanjo
Look, we're searching for |ԏMirror
Shards| . Do either of you have one?
   ▶Elly
We need them to save the school. Do you
have any idea what we're talking about?
 ▶Tadashi
...Nope!
▶Tadashi
All I have is my hand mirror for fixing
my hair. Is that good enough?
 ▶Tamaki
Of course not, dummy!
▶Tamaki
......!
Is this what you meant...?
▶Tamaki
I don't know how it got there, but this
was in my pocket...
▶Tadashi
Wh... What!? Tamaki!
▶Tadashi
Y-You never told me you had that!
▶Tadashi
No... We pledged ourselves to each
other...
▶Tadashi
And you kept a secret from me!
Oh, the pain!
▶Tamaki
Hey! I only just noticed, okay!?
▶Tamaki
Quit being stupid! Just... let me talk!
▶Tamaki
Here you go, <FirstName>. Hope this helps.
▶Tamaki
Hahah... Remember how I said, "this
one's yours"?
▶Tamaki
Well, it looks like I was right. But I'm
sure you'll do fine.
▶Tamaki
Good luck!
 ▶Tamaki
Hey! I only just noticed, okay!?
▶Tamaki
Quit being stupid! Just... let me talk!
▶Tamaki
Here you go, <FirstName>. Hope this helps.
▶Tamaki
Sorry... I wish I could do more
to help...
▶Tamaki
I mean, I guess Tadashi and me could
go with you, but...
▶Tamaki
I think we'd only hold you guys back.
▶Tamaki
Thanks for saving us. Best of luck!
 > Obtained a Ẅ♀|ԍMirror Shard| .
  ▶Tadashi
Uhh... I don't really understand what's
going on, but good luck, guys!
▶Tadashi
Leave Tamaki to me!
 ▶Ayase
Wow! Talk about your good luck! We got
ourselves a Mirror Shard!
▶Ayase
Good thing we took a little side trip
to the Dream World.
▶Ayase
Oh, hey!
▶Ayase
If Tamaki and Tadashi had a shard...
▶Ayase
Maybe Nurse Natsumi has one, too!
Let's ask her!
▶Ayase
Nurse Natsumi? Do you have a
Mirror Shard?
▶Ayase
Nurse Natsumi...? Helllooooo!
Earth to nurse!
▶Ayase
Caaaan youuuu heaaaaar meeeee? Weee neeed
aaaa shaaaard! Are you even awake!?
   ▶Nurse Natsumi
...Stop yelling... I have low blood
pressure... Ow ow ow... my head...
▶Nurse Natsumi
A mirror...? Don't have one of those...
Good night... Zzzz...
   ▶Ayase
Aww, she doesn't have one? Guess we woke
her up for nothing. Bleaaaaah!
▶Yukino
Are those two still half asleep?
Not that it matters.
 ▶Yukino
Well then, wanna go beat up the boss?
 ▶Ayase
I've heard people say Tadashi can get
pretty crazy...
▶Ayase
Now I see what they meant! Deep down,
he's like, super passionate!
   ▶Ayase
Ooooh, I wish I could be in a totally
hot relationship too!
▶Nanjo
Do they still think they're in the
Dream World?
▶Nanjo
It makes me wonder why we bothered to
awaken them...
   ▶Nanjo
Well, there goes a good deal of our
precious time.
▶Nanjo
No more complaints, I hope? Good.
Then let's move on.
▶Nanjo
Though... I admit, I'm glad to see the
three of them safe.
▶Brown
Nooooo! Tell me Tamaki's still dreaming!
▶Brown
Why'd she pick Tadashi over me!?
Objection, your honor!
   ▶Brown
Thanks to my incredible work, all three
of them are just dandy. Mwahahahaha!
▶Brown
I'm a natural-born leader!
▶Elly
Are they still under the influence of
Hypnos's power? Mm... evidently not.
▶Elly
Well, it's good that they're happy, but...
I have to agree with Yukino.
   ▶Elly
It was purely a coincidence...
▶Elly
But ultimately, Hypnos played Cupid for
Tadashi and Tamaki.
   ▶Tadashi
Argh! Stop bothering us!
▶Tadashi
We're building a relationship here.
You're really rude, you know that?
▶Tadashi
Whatever it is, can't it wait for later!?
▶Tadashi
You're done, right? Then can you give us
some privacy?
▶Tadashi
Please?
 ▶Tamaki
If you ruin this moment... I'm gonna
be REALLY mad!
   ▶Tamaki
I'm sorry, but Tadashi's all I can think
about right now.
 ▶Nurse Natsumi
Zzzz... Hahaha... How is it...?
Is it... tasty...?
 ▶Nurse Natsumi
Aaaaargh! I'm wide awake now, but I've
got a whopper of a headache.
▶Nurse Natsumi

got interrupted right at the best part...▶Yukino
Ms. Ooishi! Mr. Hanya!
You're finally awake!
▶Yukino
How are you feeling?
▶Vice-Principal Hanya
Y-Yukino! Just what's going on here!?
▶Vice-Principal Hanya
Where in blazes am I?
▶Vice-Principal Hanya
...This is all your doing, isn't it!?
▶Vice-Principal Hanya
You pack of delinquents! What are you up
to, locking us in here!?
▶Vice-Principal Hanya
Dammit, I was having such a nice dream,
and now I can't remember any of it!
▶Vice-Principal Hanya
Arrrgh! Will someone please explain to
me what's going on!?
▶Vice-Principal Hanya
*pant* *pant* You ask them, Ms. Ooishi!
They'll listen to you!
▶Principal Ooishi
Have you calmed down yet, Mr. Hanya?
▶Principal Ooishi
First off, are any of you hurt?
▶Principal Ooishi
...If not, then I have nothing more
to say.
▶Principal Ooishi
Now then... where are we? I had the most
awful dream, and...
  ▶Nanjo
This may be difficult for you to grasp,
but we saved both of your lives.
▶Nanjo
We aren't asking for your thanks, and we
certainly don't deserve your anger.
▶Nanjo
I'm sure you understand, mm?
▶Nanjo
That aside... do either of you know
anything about the Mirror Shards?
▶Nanjo
They're of the utmost importance to us.
   ▶Brown
Oh, come ON, Mr. Hanya! How can you
call us delinquents!?
▶Brown
With a little support from these guys,
I was risking my neck out there!
▶Brown
All to save you and Ms. Ooishi!
▶Brown
Wouldn't you say I deserve at least
a little thank-you for that?
▶Brown
Then again... I guess it's all right.
What's done is done!
▶Brown
What's important now is these Mirror
Shards. Do either of you know anything?
▶Brown
They're super important if me and these
guys are gonna save the school.
▶Brown
Any ideas? Any at all...?
   ▶Vice-Principal Hanya
Mirror Shards!?  Oh, you mean this?
▶Vice-Principal Hanya
I don't know how it got there, but that
was in my suit pocket.
▶Vice-Principal Hanya
It ripped a hole in the inside!
▶Vice-Principal Hanya
My daughter starts her job soon! I can't
ask her to mend my clothes anymore...
▶Vice-Principal Hanya
*ahem* Th-That wasn't relevant.
▶Vice-Principal Hanya
Forget what I just said!
▶Vice-Principal Hanya
Anyway, just what are you kids planning
to do with this!?
▶Vice-Principal Hanya
Nothing good, I'll bet!
▶Vice-Principal Hanya
Absolutely not!  Out of the question!
▶Vice-Principal Hanya
Something tells me if I give you this,
the situation will get even worse!
   ▶Ayase
Seriously!?  Are you for real!?
▶Ayase
What's wrong with you, cueball!?
▶Ayase
You didn't even let us explain, and
you're gonna say no just like that!?
▶Ayase
Ooooooh, you're the worst!
▶Ayase
This is why everyone likes the principal
and NO ONE likes you!
▶Ayase
Now gimme that shard, chromedome! 
Hand it over, baldo!
▶Ayase
GIVE IT, damn you! You assface!
  ▶Principal Ooishi
Now, now, Yuka. Ladies shouldn't use
such language.
▶Principal Ooishi
Mr. Hanya, please refrain from scolding
the students before hearing them out.
▶Principal Ooishi
I'd like you to make an effort to put
yourself on their level.
▶Principal Ooishi
It should be clear to you then whether
the students are lying or not.
▶Principal Ooishi
You can decide whether to scold them
after that.
▶Principal Ooishi
Now I ask that you please give them
this Mirror Shard.
▶Principal Ooishi
I can see in their eyes that they haven't
done anything wrong.
 ▶Vice-Principal Hanya
... ...Okay. Here you go.
  > Obtained a Ẅ♀|ԍMirror Shard| .
  ▶Nanjo
Hmph. You should've simply given it to
us in the first place.

clear understanding of what must be done.
   ▶Elly
I'm sorry...
▶Elly
But we need this, not just for ourselves,
but to save the entire school.

I won't ask for an explanation... not at
the moment, anyway.
▶Principal Ooishi
I can see that you're doing what you
believe to be right.
▶Principal Ooishi
But don't push yourselves too hard.
▶Principal Ooishi
And whatever you do, don't disappoint
those who have you in their hearts.
▶Principal Ooishi
Now, go, and do what you must.
▶Principal Ooishi
Luck be with you.
▶Vice-Principal Hanya
Hmph! I won't bother trying to stop you.
Go on! Do whatever you please!
▶Vice-Principal Hanya
... ...But listen up!
▶Vice-Principal Hanya
If... When the school is back to
normal... see me in the office!
▶Vice-Principal Hanya
I have a special lecture in mind...
▶Vice-Principal Hanya
After which I'll demand a full
explanation! So come prepared!
▶Vice-Principal Hanya
The Principal and I will be waiting!
▶Vice-Principal Hanya
I want all of you there, understood?
Not one missing!
  ▶Yukino
Ms. Ooishi...  Mr. Hanya...
▶Yukino
Heh...  Don't worry, you can hold us
to it!  All of us!
▶Yukino
See you later!
   ▶Yukino
I don't think there's anything left to
do here. We should move on.
▶Ayase
Heheh! The vice-principal is gonna love
us now!
▶Nanjo
He may not have earned our respect,
but he is still our teacher.
▶Nanjo
It's good that everything turned out
well in the end.
 ▶Brown
Cool! Now the vice-principal owes me one!
▶Brown
Heheheh... I won't let him walk over me
anymore, that's for sure!
▶Brown
... On second thought...  I take it back.
He's still a scary guy...
  ▶Elly
At any rate, I'm glad the two of them
are safe.
 ▶Vice-Principal Hanya
Mmm... It was such an amazing dream...
▶Vice-Principal Hanya
Ugh, I can almost remember it! What was
it about...?
  ▶Principal Ooishi
I had the worst dream... I'm glad I can't
remember anything about it.▶Agastya Tree

Wh-What the!? Are we... in space!?
What the hell is this!?
▶Yukino
Huh...? Who're you!?
  ▶Glasses-wearing schoolgirl
Um... hello.
▶Glasses-wearing schoolgirl
I'm Kumi Hirose. The Snow Queen entrusted
me with guarding this tower.
▶Kumi
I've, um... been ordered to kill you
all, but...
▶Kumi
To be honest, I'd rather not.
▶Kumi
So why don't you surrender? That way,
we can live happily in the Dream World.
▶Kumi
That way... at least I can spare
your life.
 ▶Nanjo
Kumi Hirose...?
▶Nanjo
A girl like you is this tower's guardian?
Enough mockery!
▶Nanjo
You wear our school's uniform, I see..
What grade are you in?
▶Nanjo
If you're trying to play a prank on us,
you've chosen a singularly bad time!
▶Nanjo
What are you doing here!? Answer me!
  ▶Brown
Hey, wait a sec. You're a St. Hermelin
girl, I can tell by the uniform.
▶Brown
So a cutie like you is the boss here?
Haha, gimme a break! Dream on...
 ▶Ayase
What, you think we're dumb or something!?
▶Ayase
How can a scrawny, depressed-looking,
four-eyes like you be a boss!?
 ▶Kumi
Hehe... You shouldn't judge people by
their looks...
▶Kumi
I could kill you fools right now,
you know.
▶Kumi
It's always the same... No one ever
listens to what I say!
▶Kumi
Everyone is so stupid...
▶Kumi
Well, I've had enough. I want you all
out of my sight... forever.
  ▶Nanjo
What the--Can you feel that? Was what
she said true, then!?
▶Nanjo
Her intentions are crystal clear...
She's going to attack!
 ▶Elly
Oh my... That sudden, evil aura...
Is she really going to...!?
▶Elly
Watch out, everyone!
  ▶Kumi
Hehe... Sir Hypnos... Sir Hypnos...!
▶Kumi
Sir Hypnos, my Prince! Please crush them!
▶Kumi
They're villains who came to hurt me!
  ▶Yukino
A Persona!?
▶Yukino
Okay... now I get it. No point in
holding back, guys!
▶Yukino
Let's do this!
▶Yukino
Well, here we are...
▶Yukino
Right, Kumi!?
▶Yukino
Sorry to keep you waiting... But we're
here now to straighten you out!
   ▶Kumi
So you came...
▶Kumi
You fools. You can't see outside the
bounds of reality...
▶Kumi
You can't grasp or accept the paradise
of dreams!
▶Nanjo
Excuse me, but who's calling who a fool?
▶Nanjo
You're the coward who lived her life
constantly fleeing from her problems...
▶Nanjo
And now you flee even from that life!
▶Nanjo
What more is there to say? Prepare
yourself to face us!
▶Brown
Kumi... I dunno what to say...
▶Brown
It really tears me up having to fight
a cutie like you... But I gotta.
▶Brown
But I gotta! For truth, justice,
and the St. Hermelin way!
▶Brown
Plus I gotta show off all these wicked
skills I know!
 ▶Ayase
Like, whatever!
▶Ayase
Us five can take a nerd like you any day!
▶Ayase
Now's the time to apologize if you're
gonna!
 ▶Kumi
Judging others by their appearances only
proves how foolish you are...
▶Kumi
Sir Hypnos!
▶Kumi
Help me!
▶Kumi
Defeat them, please!
   ▶Nanjo
What the devil...!? That's the figure we
saw in the Dream World!
▶Nanjo
He wasn't merely a part of her dream?
 ▶Elly
Could that be... Kumi's Persona!?
▶Elly
Then the Hypnos we met in the Dream
World wasn't a product of her dream!
   ▶Kumi
Sir Hypnos!
▶Kumi
They've invaded my dream to bully me!
Please, crush them!
▶Yukino
Hmph! If she's a Persona-user, there's
no need to pull our punches!
▶Yukino
Alright guys, here we go!▶Yukino
You're done. That precious prince
of yours...
▶Yukino
The Persona your heart made is gone.
▶Yukino
You wanna keep going at it? Suits me
either way...
   ▶Kumi
...So this is it...
▶Kumi
There's no place for me anywhere...
▶Kumi
Not in the real world or the dream
world...
▶Kumi
Haha... I have to flee my own dream.
Ahahaha...
▶Nanjo
Those who lack dreams are generally
shallow and tedious.
▶Nanjo
But those who focus solely on chasing
their dreams lack substance.
▶Nanjo
Don't lose sight of your dream, but don't
allow it to overtake you, either.
▶Nanjo
A dream is not a goal to chase...
▶Nanjo
Nor is it a place to hide...
▶Nanjo
A dream is that which sustains your soul.
▶Nanjo
But it will never be yours if you do
nothing but wait for it to come to you.
▶Nanjo
Dreams are not given. You must reach out
and take them!
▶Nanjo
...So Yamaoka often told me.
 ▶Brown
An easy win, thanks to me! Although...
▶Brown
It kinda left a bad taste in my mouth...
▶Ayase
Whoo! We won!
▶Ayase
Hah!  In your face!
Well?  Had enough yet? Hmmm?
   ▶Kumi
You're all so strong. If only I was
like you...
▶Kumi
I might have ignored the Snow Queen mask
and went on with my life...
▶Kumi
But I just blamed everyone else. I went
to my safe place and nursed my grudge.
▶Kumi
I... I acted just like the people that
I blamed for everything...
  ▶Nanjo
Hmph... At least you've realized your
mistake. Now you can repent.
▶Nanjo
A dream sustains your soul... but using
one as a refuge won't change reality.
   ▶Elly
Kumi...
▶Elly
Now that you acknowledge your weakness,
you're no longer weak.
▶Elly
A dream is like an oasis in one's soul...
▶Elly
It quenches the thirst of travelers
exhausted from life's journey.
▶Elly
But pleasant though the oasis may be...
▶Elly
The travelers must continue the journey.
▶Elly
We must all cross the desert of reality,
no matter how harsh it becomes...
   ▶Kumi
Thank you, everyone...
▶Kumi
I wish friends like you were there for
me back then...
▶Kumi
I'll always remember you...
▶Kumi
Thank you...  and goodbye.

Kumi Hirose wasn't so bad, really.

She was a victim of the mask...
It twisted her.

Good day to you all. It's a delight to
see you here in this tower.
▶Haughty voice
Allow me to extend a warm welcome.
Ohohohohohohohoho!
▶Nanjo
Show yourself, whoever you are! Ha...
Calling yourself this tower's guardian.
▶Nanjo
You're merely an ass in lionskin,
hiding behind the Snow Queen!
  ▶Elly
Who are you? Show yourself!
▶Elly
I assume you're the guardian of
this tower...
▶Elly
Can't you even appear before us?
▶Elly
Haha... I suppose there's nothing
to be done for it...
▶Elly
You call yourself a guardian, but you're
powerless without the Snow Queen!
▶Ayase
Yeah, you hear that? You're scared of us,
aren't you?
▶Ayase
Hahaha!
▶Ayase
Hey guys! This tower's boss seems, like,
totally weak, huh?
▶Ayase
Lucky us! Hahahahaha!
▶Haughty schoolgirl
Ohohohohoho!
▶Haughty schoolgirl
What a litter of witless, yapping
whelps you are!
▶Haughty schoolgirl
But it's all to the good... I think you
can keep me entertained for a while.
▶Haughty schoolgirl
Weak playmates fall so easily I rarely
get to enjoy my sport!
▶Haughty schoolgirl
Ohoho... I haven't introduced myself,
have I? My deepest apologies.
▶Haughty schoolgirl
I am the Snow Queen's faithful servant...
The guardian of Nemesis Tower...
▶Haughty schoolgirl
Michiko Matsudaira.
▶Michiko
I hope you grasp the honor of dying by
my hand.
▶Michiko
Incidentally... ...  Hm?  You...
 Yes, you!
▶Michiko
Oh, what a pleasant surprise!
▶Michiko
Such a fine,  handsome  gentleman!
▶Michiko
I'll spare your life if you become my
pet. What say you?
  ▶Nanjo
Wh- Wh- Wha- WHAT!?
▶Nanjo
Me?  Are you referring to ME!?
▶Nanjo
A woman like you...  repulsive in manner, 
appearance,  and soul...
▶Nanjo
You expect me to lower myself to
become YOUR plaything!?
▶Nanjo
How dare you insult me thus!
▶Nanjo
I'll personally make you regret speaking
that way to Kei Nanjo!
▶Brown
Uh... what!?  Me!?
▶Brown
W-W-Wait a second! What the hell!?
▶Brown
Who do you think you are, Ugly!? Comin'
outta nowhere and saying that stuff...
▶Brown
You think that I,  the magnificent Brown, 
would stoop to be your pet!?
▶Brown
'Cause that ain't funny, dammit!
I'm gonna beat the crap outta you!
▶Brown
I'll take that ugly face and make
it uglier!
   ▶Michiko
*gasp*  Th- This is outrageous!
▶Michiko
I take pity on you...  and you bite back
in response!?
▶Michiko
H-Hmph!
▶Michiko
I suppose you commoners could never
understand my greatness.
▶Michiko
Very well... Then I'll execute each of
you whelps myself...
▶Michiko
The time restriction on this tower is
hereby lifted!
▶Michiko
Take all the time you want! Come to me,
no matter what it takes!
▶Michiko
Once more... take as much time as
you want!
▶Michiko
I look forward to seeing you!
Until then... farewell!
   ▶Yukino
Michiko Matsudaira...
▶Yukino
Looks like she won't go down easy.
 ▶Yukino
No time limit? From the way she was
acting, there's gotta be a catch.
▶Yukino
Don'tcha think?
▶Ayase
Hmm... That Michiko girl totally reminds
me of someone.
▶Ayase
You know how she's like, super arrogant?
   ▶Nanjo
What an insolent girl! Ugh, did you see
how she looked down on us!?
▶Nanjo
Does she think she's the greatest woman
on Earth or something?
▶Nanjo
Well, I'm very much offended! Not to put
too fine a point on it, I'm infuriated!
▶Brown
She's so egotistical, it's like she was
born that way...
▶Brown
And she acts like she's better than
everyone in the whole world!
▶Brown
Just between you and me, she's a lot
like our very own Mr. N!
▶Elly
No time restriction...? I wonder what
that's all about.
▶Elly
Is it her way of saying even without
a handicap, we're no match for her?
▶Elly
Or... is it something else?
▶Elly
Whatever the truth, it's clear that she's
hiding something.
▶Elly
It may be best for us to hurry, even
without a strict time limit to observe.▶Mr. Devilish
Hey! Who said you were allowed to spill
the milk!? That milk is good for you!
▶Mr. Devilish
And you get to drink all you want...
▶Mr. Devilish
You should be happy, you gluttonous
little porker!
▶Mr. Devilish
Now go on! Drink, drink, and drink
some more!
▶Mr. Devilish
Hahahahahaha!
▶Mr. Devilish
And you, four-eyes! What're you sticking
your ass in the air like that for?
▶Mr. Devilish
It only counts as a push-up if your
whole body is close to the ground!
▶Mr. Devilish
If you keep doing it wrong, I'll have to
give you more reps again! Hahahahaha!

I'm lactose-intolerant!

*gasp* *gasp* Aaaarrrrrgh!
▶Tsutomu
Ugh...! I... I can't do this...!
▶Tsutomu
I... I'm a thinking man... My brain is
my strongest... muscle...
▶Tsutomu
My arms... simply aren't made... to do...
push-ups...!
▶Yukino
Toro!? And Tsutomu! What're you guys
doing here!?
▶Yukino
I thought you were both back at school!
▶Toro
Please... stop! I beg you!
▶Toro
B-Bluuuuurrrgh!
▶Toro
I... I'm gonna die... Ugh...
   ▶Mr. Devilish
Hey! Don't pass out, porky!
▶Mr. Devilish
You have to keep drinking!
▶Mr. Devilish
Think of yourself as a machine...
▶Mr. Devilish
An automaton made to consume milk!
▶Tsutomu
I... *pant* can't move... anymore...
▶Tsutomu
Ha... Hahaha... Ahahahaha... haha...
  ▶Mr. Devilish
Keep it up, dork! Don't lose it yet!
▶Mr. Devilish
It's Lady Michiko who'll deal with you
two in the end!
▶Mr. Devilish
If you break now, she'll definitely
punish me for it!
 ▶Nanjo
It seems it's as I suspected...
Michiko is behind all this.
▶Nanjo
Though I must say, her methods of torture
are very well-planned... very effective.
▶Nanjo
She's exploiting their weaknesses in
the most efficient manner.
▶Nanjo
As near as I can tell, though, there's
no purpose to it.
▶Nanjo
Torture simply for the sake of it...
frightening indeed.
   ▶Elly
Oh, no! They can't hold out much longer!
▶Elly
We must do something about it now, before
it becomes too late!
  ▶Tsutomu
Hahaha! Wow! A fairy!
▶Tsutomu
Haha... hahaha... I really saw it, Mom!
Hahahaha...
  ▶Toro
*puke* *cough* *hack*...!
▶Toro
Huh...? Y-Yuka! You guys!
▶Toro
P-P-P-Please save me!
 ▶Ayase
Uhhhh... Save these two goons...?
▶Ayase
I wanna say, "No way!"
▶Ayase
But like, why's Michiko doing this?
▶Ayase
Is there some point I'm not getting?
  ▶Michiko
Ohohohoho! It's because they're hideous!
▶Michiko
And ugliness is unforgivable!
▶Michiko
Therefore I, the acme of attractiveness,
am punishing these sinners!
▶Michiko
Do you understand, whelps?
▶Michiko
Ohohohohoho!
  ▶Nanjo
...Shouldn't you speak for yourself? In
any event, ugly as you may see them...
▶Nanjo
They are my fellow students, and I cannot
forsake them.
▶Nanjo
Now hand me the key to their chains.
▶Brown
Who the HELL do you think you are!?
▶Brown
You stuck-up bitch! How dare you do this
to Toro and Devil-Boy!?
▶Brown
Oh, there was a line there, and you just
crossed it!
▶Brown
Cut this out and get those chains off
them right now!
▶Michiko
Oh, you care deeply for your friends, mm?
▶Michiko
What a beautiful friendship, yes?
▶Michiko
Ohohohoho! How splendid!
▶Michiko
Hah! "Friendship"!
▶Michiko
Then in honor of your admirable
friendship...
▶Michiko
I'll tell you where the key is so you can
free these ugly fellows from their chains!
▶Michiko
It can be found on the topmost floor
of this tower...
▶Michiko
That's right--it's in my care! Ohohoho!
▶Michiko
If you wish to save your precious friends,
come to me without delay!
▶Michiko
Ohohoho!
▶Michiko
Exit the door on your left and follow the
path to reach my room in no time...
▶Michiko
Ohohohoho! However...
▶Michiko
Those Mirror Shards you so eagerly seek...
▶Michiko
You may find one through the door
behind me.
▶Michiko
The Mirror Shard is kept within a large
chest there...
▶Michiko
Along with a hint to defeat me.
▶Michiko
Ohohohohohoho! Remember, there's no time
restriction in this tower!
▶Michiko
Spend as much time as you like searching!
▶Michiko
You only have to ask that your friends
endure the torture a while longer.
▶Michiko
Ohohohohohoho!
▶Michiko
The choice is yours! I'll see you soon!
▶Michiko
Ohohoho! Ohohohohohohoho!
 ▶Toro
Help me, please! Get that key quick!
▶Toro
Blurrrrgh... T-The key... please...!
▶Tsutomu
Ugh... Uuuuuugh...
▶Tsutomu
Where... oh where... is the key...
to unchain my heart...? *gasp* *pant*
▶Mr. Devilish
What are you doing!? Stop slacking!
▶Mr. Devilish
Hahahahaha! Gulp that milk!
Work those muscles!
  ▶Yukino
We gotta help them, but we need that
Mirror Shard, too.
▶Yukino
What should we do?
   ▶Yukino
Michiko... We'll get you for this...!
 ▶Ayase
It's a good lesson for those two, though,
don'tcha think?
▶Ayase
I mean, they're kinda lame...
▶Nanjo
It's immaterial to me whether we aim for
the Mirror Shard or save these two...
▶Nanjo
My primary concern is beating some
manners into that Michiko!
   ▶Brown
They get on my nerves sometimes, but
they're not that bad.
▶Brown
I wanna help 'em out!
   ▶Elly
Gah, I can't stand that Michiko!
▶Mr. Devilish
I'm only doing what Lady Michiko ordered.
If you have a problem, take it up with her.
   ▶Toro
No... more... urrrk! Blurrrrrgh!

I'm... I'm gonna die...

What the hell is this!?
▶Yukino
Is this some kind of joke?
   ▶Nanjo
Knowing Michiko, this strikes me as the
sort of mocking nonsense she'd favor.
▶Nanjo
Still... reaching here from the torture
chamber was... quite an excursion...
 ▶Elly
Is this the chest Michiko referred to
that contains a Mirror Shard?
▶Elly
Dear me... I didn't think finding our
way here would be so strenuous...
  ▶Ayase
Ugh... I'm like, gonna fall over and die
if I hafta move another inch!
▶Ayase
Who's the genius who said we should go
get a Mirror Shard!?
▶Ayase
If it turns out there isn't one in that
chest, we came all this way for nothing!
▶Ayase
And that would SUCK!
   ▶Nanjo
It's an awfully suspicious chest...
Any volunteers to open it?
▶Nanjo
I'm 99.999% certain it's a trap.
▶Brown
That's a trap, no two ways about it,
don'tcha think?
▶Brown
So who gets to open it?
▶Brown
I'm kind of shy... not the type to take
charge... so I'm gonna pass.
  ▶Yukino
Bitching and moaning about it won't do
us any good! Let's open 'er up!
▶Yukino
Even though there's no real time limit,
we still took a little too long.
  ▶Ayase
That's it! I'm TIRED! I have to rest!
  ▶Nanjo
I've had just about enough of this
tower's devious design.
▶Nanjo
It reflects Michiko's personality to a T.
   ▶Brown
Argh! I'm beat!
▶Brown
Oh man... I don't wanna think about
walking back to the torture chamber!
   ▶Elly
Whew... Mind if we take a short break?
▶Elly
I'm quite worn out.
   > Obtained a Ẅ♀|ԍMirror Shard| .
> ... ... ... ... ... ... ... 
You spot a piece of paper in the corner
of the chest.
> It appears to be a letter from Michiko.
> You open the letter.
  "Ohohohoho! So you've reached this chest,
have you? What a greedy bunch!
"It must have been quite an endeavor.
Ohohohohohoho!
"You found what you sought, yes? Unlike
you rotters, I keep my promises!
"And now, as promised, I will reveal
my weakness!
"I'm at my weakest... When you don't
dawdle in getting to me! Ohohohohoho!
"I do hope this helps! So by all means,
hurry to my chamber! I'll be waiting!

Michiko Matsudaira! We're here for you!
Give us the key to free Toro and Tsutomu!

way you want to play it!
▶Yukino
That's my plan, anyway. I have a feeling
you won't give up that easily, huh?
  ▶Michiko
I-Impossible! You're here so soon!?
▶Michiko
Wh-What about the Mirror Shard? Didn't...
Didn't you go get it?
▶Michiko
Oh... Oh...! How can this be!?
▶Michiko
The source of my strength... the power
of negative emotion...!
▶Michiko
The hatred and anger is too weak! This
won't be enough at all!
▶Michiko
Not only that, but...
▶Michiko
What are these disgusting feelings that
flow into me?
▶Michiko
Gratitude...? Friendship...!?
▶Michiko
THIS is what those two are thinking as
they're being tortured?
▶Michiko
*gasp* You couldn't have...!
▶Michiko
You figured out how this tower works!?
▶Michiko
No! Simply impossible! My plans were
flawless!
▶Michiko
Without exceptions, humans think, "As
long as I'm okay, others don't matter."
▶Michiko
This mindset... no, it's even more
atavistic than that!
▶Michiko
It's instinct!
▶Michiko
My plans revolve around the basic human
instinct for self-preservation!
▶Michiko
So why? Why!?
▶Michiko
Why would you try to help others with
the expectation of no reward?
▶Michiko
I can't understand at all!
▶Michiko
My strength... This level of power is
FAR from adequate!
▶Michiko
What am I supposed to do?
▶Nanjo
Frankly, I'd normally be happy to leave
those two and retrieve the Mirror Shard.
▶Nanjo
Hmph! As if I gave a damn what that empty
head of yours was scheming.
▶Nanjo
But you made one fatal error...
▶Nanjo
You have angered me.
▶Nanjo
Did you seriously think you could mock
me and walk away unharmed?
▶Nanjo
Kei Nanjo is no one's pet!
▶Nanjo
You will pay for your insult with your
life. Prepare yourself!
▶Brown
I'd never turn my back on my friends!
It's bad for my rep, man!
▶Brown
And I'd DEFINITELY never forgive
a bitch like you!
▶Brown
This is for torturing Toro and Tsutomu!
For calling us all "whelps"!
▶Brown
But most of all...
▶Brown
For saying I'm your pet! You're gonna
pay royally for that one!
▶Brown
Now let's get this showdown started!
▶Ayase
And you know what?
▶Ayase
We don't even need all 12 Mirror Shards!
Eight or so should do the job just fine!
▶Ayase
I like, don't care too much about what
happens to Toro or Tsutomu.
▶Ayase
But seeing a jerk like you act like
some stuck-up celeb...
▶Ayase
Now that totally pisses me off! Get it?
 ▶Michiko
*shriek* Silence! Silence! SILENCE!
▶Michiko
Let me be clear on this...
▶Michiko
You're saying that I am inferior to that
hideous pair?
▶Michiko
I, the lovely Michiko?
▶Michiko
Oh... Oh...! This is outrageous!
▶Michiko
My magnificent plans were simply too
sophisticated for you mangy curs!
▶Michiko
Oh... Oh...!
▶Michiko
I knew I should have slain you all as
soon as you entered this tower!
▶Michiko
Ohhhhh!
  ▶Nanjo
Will you cease those "oh"s of yours?
▶Nanjo
Hmph. You sound like a seal...
▶Nanjo
Regardless, it's just as Yuka said.
▶Nanjo
A Mirror Shard or two either way has no
impact whatsoever on our victory!
▶Nanjo
We cannot allow your ilk to continue
these ruthless, selfish acts!
▶Nanjo
Today marks the end of your tyranny!
  ▶Elly
Give in, Michiko.
▶Elly
The more you squall, the more prominent
your unsightliness becomes...
▶Elly
You should see yourself in a mirror.
▶Elly
Ahaha... I, for one, would be ashamed to
look that way in public.
▶Elly
Ayase is right.
▶Elly
A failure to acquire a couple of Mirror
Shards in this tower won't hurt a bit.
▶Elly
Let's draw a line under this conversation,
shall we?
▶Elly
However much we explain it...
▶Elly
You'll never understand our reasons for
coming directly here.
▶Elly
Now, en garde!
▶Michiko
No! I won't succumb to the human heart!
▶Michiko
Kindness!
▶Michiko
Friendship!
▶Michiko
Trust!
▶Michiko
Such things simply do not exist in
this world!
▶Michiko
I'll prove it to you with your defeat!
▶Michiko
Lord Nemesis... Be the shield which
protects me!
▶Michiko
Lord Nemesis... Be the sword which
vanquishes my foe!
▶Michiko
Heed my call!
▶Michiko
Go! Nemesis!
   ▶Yukino
Getting your Persona out, huh?
▶Yukino
Okay, guys, battle stations! This one's
for Toro and Tsutomu!
 ▶Yukino
Looks like Michiko's room...
▶Yukino
But talk about bad taste.
▶Yukino
What are these faces on the walls?
   ▶Michiko
Ohohohohoho!
▶Michiko
These faces are all that's left of those
who didn't obey me...
▶Michiko
These faces are your future!
▶Michiko
Hmhm... Five new faces for my collection.
Truly a red-letter day!
▶Michiko
Ohohohohoho!
▶Michiko
So, what do you think of my collection?
I hope you appreciate it.
▶Michiko
Dirty thieves who value material objects
over friends should pay special attention.
▶Michiko
Oh yes, don't think I didn't notice you
accepted my gift of the Mirror Shard.
▶Michiko
Ohohohohohoho!
▶Michiko
I can't believe you fell so easily into
my trap!
▶Michiko
Lured by a single Mirror Shard...
▶Michiko
Thereby throwing away your only chance
of defeating me!
▶Michiko
Ohohohohoho.
   ▶Nanjo
Eh? A trap!?
▶Nanjo
*gasp* That letter...! What was that
all about? Answer me!
▶Brown
Huh? We fell into your trap?
Whaddaya mean?
▶Brown
Hey, you better explain this to us!
▶Ayase
Whatever, ugly!
▶Ayase
You're just bluffing 'cause we got the
Mirror Shard and you're outta luck!
▶Ayase
You're such a liar! Just let us beat
you already!
   ▶Michiko
Hohohohohoho!
▶Michiko
Allow me to tell you how this Nemesis
Tower works...
▶Michiko
Anger, hatred despair...
▶Michiko
The tower absorbs those negative emotions
as energy, allowing it to grow...
▶Michiko
You might say the tower is a living thing.
▶Michiko
By tapping into the energy stored within
the tower...
▶Michiko
There's no limit to how strong I can
become!
▶Michiko
Do you understand now?
▶Michiko
Hmhmhm...
▶Michiko
The anguish and rage that hideous pair
felt as they suffered...
▶Michiko
The hatred and despair that filled their
hearts as their friends forsook them...
▶Michiko
Hahahahah!
▶Michiko
Those emotions have fueled the incredible
power I wield!
▶Michiko
Ohohoho!
▶Michiko
Low-born fools! Curse your own
selfish nature!
  ▶Nanjo
Her power is indeed immense...!
▶Nanjo
Why, she's merely standing there, and I
can feel her strength from here!
▶Nanjo
It must be true, then, that Kenta and
Tsutomu's anger and hatred fuel her...
▶Nanjo
How could I have let this happen!?
   ▶Elly
What!? Ngh... This malevolent force...!
▶Elly
It's coming from Michiko!? But she's
only standing in place!
▶Elly
The anger and hatred those two felt as
they were tortured...
▶Elly
Their emotions must have enhanced her
power beyond what we can imagine...!
▶Elly
We've been utterly outfoxed!
   ▶Michiko
Now, presumptuous whelps...
▶Michiko
For your crimes in defying the Snow Queen
and making light of me...
▶Michiko
I'll add you to the ranks of those who
have betrayed me!
▶Michiko
Show me your anger! Your regret!
Your despair! Your hatred!
▶Michiko
All your most negative emotions!
▶Michiko
Bare your human nature and face me!
▶Michiko
You'll no doubt make a splendid feast!
▶Michiko
Hmhmhmhm...
▶Michiko
Hahahahahahaha! Ohohohohohohohohoho!
▶Michiko
Lord Nemesis... Be the shield which
protects me!
▶Michiko
Lord Nemesis... Be the sword which
vanquishes my foe!
▶Michiko
Heed my call!
▶Michiko
Go! Nemesis!
  ▶Yukino
Tch... She's getting her Persona ready!
▶Yukino
No use crying over spilt milk, guys!
▶Yukino
Concentrate! We've gotta defeat her
somehow!
   ▶Yukino
Looks like Michiko's room...
▶Yukino
But talk about bad taste.
▶Yukino
What are these faces on the walls?
   ▶Michiko
Ohohohohoho!
▶Michiko
These faces are all that's left of those
who didn't obey me...
▶Michiko
These faces are your future!
▶Michiko
Hmhm... Five new faces for my collection.
Truly a red-letter day!
▶Michiko
Ohohohohoho!
▶Michiko
So, what do you think of my collection?
I hope you appreciate it.
▶Michiko
Well? What took you so long in getting
here? I grew weary of waiting.
▶Michiko
Ohohohohohoho!
▶Michiko
I must say, I can't believe you fell so
easily into my trap!
▶Michiko
Removing the tower's time restriction
turned out to be a very good move.
▶Michiko
As a result of that, you threw away
your only chance of defeating me!
▶Michiko
It's too funny! I can't stop laughing!
Ohohohohoho...
   ▶Nanjo
Eh? A trap!?
▶Nanjo
What are you talking about? What have
you done!?
  ▶Brown
Huh? We fell into your trap?
Whaddaya mean?
▶Brown
Hey, you better explain this to us!
▶Ayase
Whatever, ugly!
▶Ayase
You're just bluffing 'cause we actually
got to you and now you're outta luck!
▶Ayase

you already!

become!
▶Michiko
Do you understand now?
▶Michiko
Hmhmhm...
▶Michiko
The anguish and rage that hideous pair
felt as they suffered...
▶Michiko
The doubt and despair that filled their
hearts as their friends never returned...
▶Michiko
Hahahahah!
▶Michiko
Those emotions have fueled the incredible
power I wield!
▶Michiko
Bask in its immensity!
▶Michiko
I'd never have gained this much if you
hadn't spent so long reaching here.
▶Michiko
I can't thank you enough!
   ▶Nanjo
Her power is indeed immense...!
▶Nanjo
Why, she's merely standing there, and I
can feel her strength from here!
▶Nanjo
It must be true, then, that Kenta and
Tsutomu's anger and hatred fuel her...

power beyond what we can imagine...!

▶Elly
If only I'd been more suspicious about
the lack of a time limitation...!
   ▶Michiko
Now, presumptuous whelps...
▶Michiko
For your crimes in defying the Snow Queen
and making light of me...
▶Michiko
I'll add you to the ranks of those who
have betrayed me!

▶Yukino

▶Yukino
Concentrate! We've gotta defeat her
somehow!▶Yukino
Hmph... game, set, and match!
▶Yukino
Or do you wanna go another few rounds?
 ▶Michiko
I... I lost!?
▶Michiko
Unbelievable... Inconceivable!
▶Michiko
And to a pack of crude delinquents,
no less!
▶Michiko
Oh! How can this be?
▶Michiko
Oh...! Ohhhhh!
▶Nanjo
You are so tiresome.
▶Nanjo
You lost, and we won. That's an
indisputable fact.
▶Nanjo
It won't change no matter how much you
squall and twist that unsightly face.
▶Nanjo
Now go away, as befits a loser...
▶Nanjo
...Please. I beg of you...
  ▶Brown
AAAAARRRRRRGGGGGGGHHHHHHH!
▶Brown
SHUT! THE HELL! UP!
▶Brown
You got a beatdown from me, the always-
amazing Brown, and his gang!
▶Brown
Is that getting through to you!?
▶Brown
So stop horking like a seal and get out
of our sight!
▶Brown
PLEASE!?
▶Ayase
Yup, that's right!
▶Ayase
You're like, totally, hopelessly stupid.
I'm sick of looking at your stupid face.
▶Ayase
Will you just get outta here? Like, now?
  ▶Michiko
*shriek* Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaagh!
▶Michiko
What manner of egotistic, abhorrent
monsters are you!?
▶Michiko
I've done nothing, yet the five of you
gang up on me, then gloat in triumph!
▶Michiko
People are always like that!
▶Michiko
You lot are no exception!
▶Michiko
And neither are those ugly faces on the
walls who once senselessly bullied me!
▶Michiko
Don't you understand!?
▶Michiko
All I did was leverage my vast wealth to
land the role of the Snow Queen!
▶Michiko
And also have that floozy hanging around
my beau in the drama club expelled!
▶Michiko
And bribe the teachers to lift my grades
slightly more towards acceptability!
▶Michiko
But those morons in my class...
▶Michiko
They called me names! They talked behind
my back! They gave me the cold shoulder!
▶Michiko
Only the Snow Queen mask ever extended
a helping hand to me!
▶Michiko
That's right... it and no one else!
▶Michiko
Only the mask understood my profound
sorrow! My wretched circumstances!
▶Michiko
Tell me, what right does anyone have to
pick on poor, little me!?
▶Michiko
I certainly can't understand!
 ▶Nanjo
The fault... is entirely yours!
▶Nanjo
This is the reason why you abandoned
your life in the real world?
▶Nanjo
Why you became the Snow Queen's minion
and guardian of this tower?
▶Nanjo
I'm... I'm at a loss for words.
   ▶Elly
What? But it's entirely your fault!
▶Elly
Is this really why you abandoned the real
world to be a minion of the Snow Queen?
▶Elly
Unbelievable... You've gone completely
round the twist...!
  ▶Michiko
Aaaaaaagh!
▶Michiko
You continue to mock me, even after
knowing my heartrending past?
▶Michiko
I can't believe this!
▶Michiko
I've had enough! I suppose it was
entirely too much to ask...
▶Michiko
How could you, the poor in spirit,
understand my sorrow!?
▶Michiko
Hmph! Fine!
▶Michiko
I'll give you a win, this once!
▶Michiko
But I warn you...
▶Michiko
In due time, the thirst for revenge
churning in me will be denied no more!
▶Michiko
And on that day, I shall once again
give you hell!
▶Michiko
Remember that!
▶Michiko
I'll stand in your way, again and again!
▶Michiko
Do look forward to it! Until then...
Farewell!
▶Michiko
Ohohohohoho! Ohohohohohohohoho!

Michiko Matsudaira... If I never see her
again, it'll be too soon.
▶Yukino
Oh, hey! I wonder if Toro and Tsutomu
are okay...
▶Yukino
That stupid Michiko! She didn't even give
us the key!
▶Yukino
We should check on 'em once we get back
to school.

C'mon, let's go.

Hi, everyone!
▶Cheerful schoolgirl
Welcome to good old Thanatos Tower!
▶Cheerful schoolgirl
How're you all doing today?
▶Cheerful schoolgirl
I'm your host, everyone's favorite idol,
Yuriko Yamamoto!
▶Nanjo
What nonsense is this!?
▶Nanjo
Perhaps it's none of my business...
▶Nanjo
But isn't it a bit conceited to claim
you're everyone's favorite idol?
▶Nanjo
Your arrogance is rather irksome.
   ▶Brown
Yeaaaaah! Y!  U!  R!  I!  K!  O!
Yurikoooo!  *whistle*
▶Brown
...Ugh! I got carried away...
▶Brown
Who the heck are you!?
  ▶Ayase
Oh. My. God. You look, like, SO dumb.
▶Ayase
Who do you think you are, weirdo?
▶Yuriko
Uh, hello? Who's calling who a weirdo?
▶Yuriko
Ohh! Are you jealous 'cause I'm so
cutesy-wutesy?
▶Yuriko
*sigh*... Being too pretty is a sin,
isn't it?
▶Yuriko
Sorry 'bout that! Ahahaha!
 ▶Nanjo
So... why are you here?
▶Nanjo
We're on a tight schedule here!
▶Nanjo
Have you come to fight us? If so,
we gladly accept the challenge!
  ▶Elly
Er... so... why are you here?
▶Elly
Is it a battle you seek? We'd have no
objections to that.
  ▶Yuriko
Awww, don't talk like that, guys!
▶Yuriko
I'm just here to tell you how to open the
door back there.
▶Yuriko
So put your listening hats on!
▶Yuriko
Reaaaady? Then here goes!
▶Yuriko
You see those two candles? One to the
right of the door, one to the left?
▶Yuriko
Good! All you have to do is blow one
out, and poof! Door's open!
▶Yuriko
Okey-dokey! I hope you try 200% to get
to me! Bye-bye!
 ▶Yukino
Well, uh... this is definitely a trap.
▶Yukino
But that girl... Yuriko, right? I get the
feeling she's tougher than she looks.
   ▶Yukino
It's hard to describe how, but... this
tower has an eerie feel to it.
 ▶Yukino
Damn that Yuriko!
▶Yukino
She acts like an airhead, but she's
a hardcore con artist!
 ▶Ayase
I can't believe that girl! What a loser!
▶Ayase
What does she think life's all about?
Who does she think she is!?
▶Ayase
Oooooh, she's so aggravating! Right?
▶Nanjo
Good grief... Our hands are already full
with Yuka's incessant yapping.
▶Nanjo
And now we face a tower guardian exactly
like her... I've got to get out of here.
  ▶Brown
Psst! Hey! Yuriko's a cutie, huh?
  ▶Elly
What frightens me is that I can't tell
what Yuriko is thinking...
▶Elly
It seems as if she enjoys our
confrontations...
▶Elly
And catching us in her traps.
▶Elly
It's as Yukino says... this won't be easy.
 > Blow out the candle? 
  ▶Yukino
Huh!? Wh-What's happening...? 
S-Something's being yanked out of me...
▶Yukino
Aagh! AAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH!
  ▶Yuriko
Teeheehee! Gotcha!
▶Yuriko
Teeheeheeheeheehee!
▶Yuriko
Did you really think you could get past
here for free? Silly billies!
▶Yuriko
Tit for tat's the name of the game!
▶Yuriko
If you want anything in this tower,
you gotta give something up in return!
▶Yuriko
Life is hard, huh?
▶Yuriko
Well, I'll be taking your other life... 
Per- so- na!
▶Yuriko
Thanks! Teeheeheeheehee! See ya!
   ▶Yukino
Dammit! What's up with that twit!?
▶Yukino
What was that all about, anyway? "I'll be
taking your other life"?
▶Yukino
What did she mean?

This is a trap if I ever saw one. Two
chests in the back, and nothing else.
▶Yukino
It's bad news, like that room with
the candles.
▶Yukino
You know how they say to let sleeping
dogs lie? We should leave these be.
   ▶Yuriko
Awww, you big meanie.
▶Yuriko
I put together a present just 'cause you
guys were trying soooo hard.
▶Yuriko
And you're gonna walk away just like
that? I'm gonna cry... *sniffle*...
▶Nanjo
Hmph, as if we'd fall for that. We know
all about your shenanigans.
▶Nanjo
Just ignore her, Yukino.
   ▶Brown
A present!? L-Let's take it, Yukino!
▶Brown
No one that pretty can be a crook.
True fact!
▶Brown
C'mon, we can trust Yuriko!
 ▶Ayase
Huh. Sure, it looks like a trap, but it
sounds kinda fun!
▶Ayase
I don't wanna chicken out... Okay, go
ahead and tell us what's up!
   ▶Yuriko
Woo-hoo!
▶Yuriko
I knew you'd get it! I think you and me
could be best friends forever!
▶Yuriko
Oh, I'm so happy!
   ▶Nanjo
Stop blathering and get to the point.
Your mannerisms give me a migraine.
  ▶Elly
I'm sure you're up to no good with this
so-called "gift." It's a waste of time.
 ▶Yuriko
Awww, why can't you be more positive?
I know you're all thrilled!
▶Yuriko
Oh well, I'll go ahead and explain the
gift! Put your listening hat on!
▶Yuriko
One of these two chests has a Mirror
Shard! We all like those, don't we?
▶Yuriko
And I'm feeling super-duper-generous
today, so you can try your luck for free!
▶Yuriko
But! You only get one try!
▶Yuriko
And of course, something bad will happen
if you open the wrong one. Uh-oh!
▶Yuriko
Whee! Sounds fun, huh?
▶Yuriko
Good luck! Teeheeheehee!
▶Ayase
Oh, so it IS a trap?
▶Ayase
Hmm... well, it's a good chance anyways!
We should like, give it a shot!
▶Ayase
I have a feeling she's not lying.
▶Ayase
C'mon, it's no big deal, right?
▶Ayase
I take full responsibility if anything
happens! So let's crack one open!
   ▶Yukino
Yuriko's toying with our lives and loving
every minute of it!
▶Yukino
*sigh* I hate her frickin' guts.
   ▶Ayase
I dunno why, but it seems like Yuriko is
forcing herself to be like this.
▶Ayase
That's just how it feels to me.
  ▶Ayase
Gahhh! That Yuriko is such a backstabber!
I'm like, SO pissed right now!
   ▶Nanjo
There are two sorts of traps.
▶Nanjo
The one is designed to kill one's target.
▶Nanjo
The other slowly instills fear in it.
▶Nanjo
Yuriko's traps fall decidedly into the
latter category...
▶Brown
Man, the traps here are evil!
▶Brown
This tower's packed with danger for an
honest joe like me! No, seriously.
▶Elly
These traps in the tower... It's all
a game to her.
▶Elly
Each time we make progress, she torments
us just enough so as not to kill anyone.
▶Elly
She's even prepared a gift to entice us.
▶Elly
Everything's been meticulously planned...
▶Elly
...so that she can kill us herself at
the endgame.
 > Open this chest? 
  ▶Ayase
Yeeeeek! S-Something's coming out of me!
   ▶Yuriko
Teeheeheehee! Too bad!
▶Yuriko
I'm taking your other self as a forfeit!
▶Yuriko
Okey-dokey! Bye-bye!
▶Ayase
Gaaah! I can't believe that little sneak!
▶Ayase
Argh... I can't use my Persona anymore!
▶Ayase
What am I gonna do!?
 > Open this chest? 
  ▶Ayase
Bingo! We got the right one! This rules!
▶Ayase
See? I toldja we should open a chest!
Am I right or am I right?
   ▶Yuriko
Huh... Looks like Lady Luck's on
your side.
▶Yuriko
Okey-dokey! You win this game!
Congrats!
▶Yuriko
It's just a little further to my room,
so don't give up now, 'kay?
▶Yuriko
I'll give each of you the bestest death
ever! I'll be waiting!
 > Obtained a Ẅ♀|ԍMirror Shard| .
  > You decide not to open the chest.
   > The chest is empty.

 ▶Yuriko
Heheh... Too bad. Your time's up...
▶Yuriko
Your desperate efforts were the perfect
way to celebrate the Eternal Night...
▶Yuriko
But the overture ends here.
▶Yuriko
Now, behold... the Eternal Night.
▶Yukino
Wh-What!? What's happening!? Oh, don't
tell me...
▶Yukino
Did Yuriko cut our time limit for this
tower short as a penalty?
▶Yukino
What the hell, Yuka!?
▶Yukino
You said you'd take full responsibility,
didn't you!? When we opened the chest!?
▶Yukino
So what're you gonna do now, huh!?
▶Yukino
I told you from the start we shoulda let
these chests be!
   ▶Ayase
What, it's my fault?
▶Ayase
No no no no! Hold on a sec!
▶Ayase
I, uh... I didn't think it was gonna
end up like this...
▶Ayase
Ahaha... I mean, I-I did say I'd take
full responsibility, but...
▶Ayase
I thought it just sounded like the
thing to say at the time...
▶Ayase
H-Hey! It's Yuriko who did this...!
Not me...
   ▶Yuriko
...Teehee... Teeheeheeheehee!
▶Yuriko
Time's up! Game over!
▶Yuriko
...Juuuuust kidding!
▶Yuriko
Boy, I got you guys good, didn't I?
▶Yuriko
I should get an Oscar for my awesome
Snow Queen impression!
▶Yuriko
Teeheeheeheehee!
▶Yuriko
Yay! You totally believed it! Fooled ya!
▶Yuriko
Wow, that was great! You really thought
it was all over, huh?
▶Yuriko
Anyway... the Mirror Shard's not in this
chest! Too bad, so sad!
▶Yuriko
Catch you guys later! Bye-bye!
 ▶Ayase
I'm SO! MAD!
▶Ayase
Ugh! I can't BELIEVE I fell for that!
▶Ayase
Hey, <FirstName>! How come you didn't
open the left box!?
▶Ayase
It's, like, totally your fault we didn't
get a shard!
▶Ayase
Not mine!▶Yukino
What's this? It looks different from the
rest of the tower.
   ▶Large beast
HUMANS. WHY ARE YOU HERE?
▶Large beast
BE AWARE THAT THIS IS THE ENTRANCE
TO THE UNDERWORLD...
▶Large beast
AND I AM ITS GUARDIAN, CERBERUS.
   ▶Nanjo
Don't stand in our way.
▶Nanjo
We won't hesitate to do away with
you, beast!
  ▶Brown
This animal's trying to stop me? What,
does he think he's a king or something?
▶Brown
He does look strong, though... I know!
I'll strike up a little conversation.
▶Brown
Umm... "ME MAD. YOU MOVE."
 ▶Ayase
Look, we don't wanna fight you, okay?
▶Ayase
We just wanna see what's through there.
Pretty please?
   ▶Cerberus
BEYOND HERE IS THE LAND OF THE DEAD,
WHERE DECEASED SOULS GATHER.
▶Cerberus
I DOUBT YOU HAVE ANY BUSINESS THERE.
   ▶Nanjo
The land of the dead, eh? Mmm...
Interesting.
▶Nanjo
With demons running rampant, this tower
itself is much like Hell already.
▶Nanjo
There is nothing left for us to fear.
▶Nanjo
Besides, it may be linked to the loss
of our Personas en route.
▶Nanjo
What Yuriko said to us... "I'll be taking
your other life"...
▶Nanjo
It implies the lost Persona.
▶Nanjo
Taking one's life signifies death,
naturally...
▶Nanjo
And here we are, where the souls of the
deceased gather.
▶Nanjo
It's self-evident that our "other self,"
the Persona, is here!
▶Nanjo
You're under orders from Yuriko to bar
our path, aren't you!?
▶Nanjo
I demand you let us through!
▶Elly
Ahaha... The key to the mystery of
our lost Persona power may be here.
▶Elly
When Yuriko said, "I'll take your
other life"...
▶Elly
What she meant was that she'd taken
away the Persona.
▶Elly
Taking life means death, after all.
▶Elly
And this is apparently where the souls
of the deceased gather...
▶Elly
Where else could our missing "other
soul" be?
▶Elly
Excuse me, Cerberus?
▶Elly
Am I correct in thinking you've been set
here by Yuriko to keep us out?
▶Elly
You must let us through! Or else...
   ▶Cerberus
VERY PERCEPTIVE.
▶Cerberus
YOUR DEDUCTIONS ARE LARGELY CORRECT.
▶Cerberus
YES. YOUR SO-CALLED "PERSONA"
IS HERE.
▶Cerberus
BUT I HAVE NO DEALINGS WITH YURIKO.
I GUARD THIS PLACE OF MY OWN WILL.
▶Cerberus
THE LAND OF THE DEAD NEEDS NO
INCOMPLETE SOULS.
▶Cerberus
TAKE WHAT IS YOURS.
  ▶Yukino
Sounds good. Then we'll be on our way.
▶Yukino
No need to bother you.
▶Yukino
The land of the dead, huh? Never thought
I'd go there while I was still alive.
▶Ayase
Ooooh, the afterlife! Freaky!
  ▶Nanjo
I'd prefer to avoid it, but I suppose
I have business there at the moment.
 ▶Brown
Whoa, the land of the dead! Cooool!
Maybe we can get on TV after all this!
▶Brown
"A Student in the Afterlife," starring
Hidehiko Uesugi!
▶Brown
Mwahahahaha!
▶Elly
Wow! I get to visit the underworld while
I'm still alive!
▶Elly
I'm the luckiest girl on Earth!
▶Cerberus
THE DEMONS OF TARTARUS ARE STRONGER
THAN THOSE OF THE TOWER.
▶Cerberus
THEIR HATRED OF THE LIVING IS FIERCE.
BE CAREFUL.

Seeing my own Persona like this drives
home how mysterious a Persona really is.
   ▶Ayase
I thought this place would be, like,
way scarier, but this isn't so bad.
   ▶Nanjo
The world that's home to the souls of
the deceased...
▶Nanjo
It's certainly not a comfortable place
to be, but it has a certain solemn air.
▶Nanjo
It puts me in a contemplative mood.
   ▶Brown
If I die, I'm going straight to heaven
for sure!
▶Brown
So this is the last time I'm gonna be
seeing the underworld! Yep.
 ▶Elly
This place is very different from our
common perception of the underworld.
  ▶Mariko
This'll knock your socks off...
▶Mariko
Sometimes these images appear on the
walls here, and they look like you guys!
▶Mariko
I took a few snaps. I'll give you a print
once the film's developed!

own ghosts!

It's an unofficial club, and I'm the

devotee, but...  I...  this is...
▶Mariko
This is GREAT! I'm SO lucky I get to see
an awesome paranormal event like this!
▶Mariko
I've taken so many pics already! I'm gonna
submit these babies to national magazines!

Who's that girl with the camera around
her neck?
  ▶Yukino
That Mariko girl's a real weirdo.
▶Yukino
Same goes for Tsutomu. I just don't get
these guys who're into the occult.
 ▶Ayase
That girl's freaky. Like, totally.
 ▶Ayase
Her pink uniform's cute, huh?
  ▶Nanjo
Who is that girl? She doesn't appear to
be from our school.
▶Nanjo
That Mariko... She certainly is enjoying
the situation.
▶Brown
That's Yamakumo High's uniform. They're
a pretty liberal school.
▶Brown
And wow, she's pretty cute! I wonder who
she is...
▶Brown
Maybe I should explore this tower
with Mariko...
   ▶Elly
Whatever is that girl doing here?
   ▶Elly
She may be even more of a danger to
herself than Tsutomu...
 ▶Mariko
Huh? You wanna know if anything used to
be in that chest over there?
▶Mariko
Yeah, sure! This broken mirror piece!
I can feel strong spiritual energy in it.
▶Mariko
It's gotta be some kinda powerful
supernatural object.
▶Mariko
Huh? You want it...? Hmmmm...
▶Mariko
How 'bout this? I'll sell it for
࿌,000 yen!
▶Mariko
I found it first, after all... It's not
such a bad price, is it?
   > Buy the Mirror Shard from her? 
▶Mariko
Thanks!
▶Mariko
I've been taking roll after roll of pics
here, so I'm nearly out of film.
▶Mariko
Now I can buy some more!
  > Obtained a Ẅ♀|ԍMirror Shard| .
  ▶Mariko
Oh, so you don't want it?
▶Mariko
That's cool. I'll just send it to the
Atlantis News and have 'em appraise it!
  ▶Mariko
Huh? You don't even have ࿌,000 yen?
*sigh* That's just sad!
▶Mariko
Tell you what, you can work it off as
my assistant.
▶Mariko
What? No way...?
▶Mariko
Then fork over the cash!
  ▶Mariko
I'm one lucky skunk!
▶Mariko
It's not every day you get to take photos
of the afterlife!

I'm gonna send these in to the Fortean
Times as soon as I get back!

Looks like we've reached Yuriko's room.
▶Yukino
But this isn't what I was expecting from
her cutesy attitude...
▶Yukino
Hey, Yuriko! You know we're here, right?
Hurry up and come on out!
▶Yukino
Or are you up to something again?
   ▶Yuriko
Geez Louise! You don't have to wake the
dead, y'know! I can hear you just fine!
▶Yuriko
Anyway... You have a really nice face!
▶Yuriko
How 'bout you die here? That way you can
keep your looks forever!
▶Yuriko
If you keep on living, you'll get older
and end up all wrinkly and ugly!
▶Yuriko
So c'mon, why not die right now, when
you're most beautiful, like I did?
▶Yuriko
Then we can live in this tower together,
looking gorgeous!
▶Yuriko
Does that sound great or what? C'mon, we
totally should!
▶Yuriko
It'll be soooo much fun!
▶Yuriko
I'm super glad I came to this tower,
like the Snow Queen's mask said!
▶Yuriko
I'll stay young and pretty forever
and ever!
▶Yuriko
But I was getting a little bored, being
here all by my lonesome.
▶Yuriko
And I don't wanna fight you guys, so...
Whaddaya say?
  ▶Nanjo
Do you understand the substance of what
you're saying?
▶Nanjo
What you obtained through death and the
power of the mask...
▶Nanjo
It is merely the end of your existence,
the real world without you...
▶Nanjo
Absolute, unending solitude within
this tower.
▶Nanjo
This is not the eternal beauty you
wished for!
▶Brown
Huh? Yuriko... what're you saying?
▶Brown
The Snow Queen's mask killed you and now
you're the guardian of this tower, huh?
▶Brown
Well, if you're dead now, I guess you
won't get any older, but...
▶Brown
That's not worth throwing away our lives,
our futures, in the real world.
▶Brown
Sorry, but I'm gonna have to pass on
this "eternal beauty" gig!
▶Yuriko
Sh-Shut up!
▶Yuriko
You guys just don't understand how it is
to be a girl!
▶Yuriko
H-How about you? You're totally the cutest
one of the bunch.
▶Yuriko
You get what I'm saying, right? You can
have eternal beauty, right here!
▶Yuriko
We'll stay pretty... and...
  ▶Ayase
Not one more word!
▶Ayase
Don't think for a second that you and
me are the same type!
▶Ayase
You really, and I mean REALLY, piss
me off!
▶Ayase
I would never die just to stay pretty!
▶Ayase
You know what? You gave up on dying!
▶Ayase
And growing older!
▶Ayase
And living your life like a normal person!
▶Ayase
You gave up on everything you had!
▶Ayase
Yeah, you heard me! You're a loser who
threw away all her responsibilities!
▶Nanjo
Well said, Yuka.
▶Nanjo
"Even a worm will turn," indeed.
▶Nanjo
Give it up, Yuriko.
▶Nanjo
Yuka is most like you of all of us, and
you can see she has utterly rejected you.
▶Nanjo
In other words, no one is buying the
nonsense you're trying to peddle.
 ▶Elly
Spot on! That was so cool!
▶Elly
I couldn't have said it better myself,
Ayase! You blew me away!
▶Elly
Now then, Yuriko...
▶Elly
Since you've been rejected by Ayase, the
one who could identify with you most...
▶Elly
I doubt anyone else here would have time
for you! What will you do now?
 ▶Yuriko
But... I...
▶Yuriko
I was only trying to help you guys out!
▶Yuriko
I just wanted to have some laughs with
everyone!
▶Yuriko
What about that don't you get!?
▶Yuriko
That's it! No more Ms. Nice Yuriko!
▶Yuriko
You have no idea how strong I am! Beg for
your life if you want--I won't listen!
▶Yuriko
I'll crush you so hard there'll be nothing
left! Not even your soul!
  ▶Yukino
Heh... As Kei would probably say, "Only
death can cure a fool!"
▶Yukino
Too bad death doesn't seem to have helped
in your case!
▶Yukino
Come on, then! We'll kill all the stupid
out of you!
▶Yukino
Here we go!▶Yukino
It's the end of the line for you, Yuriko!
Be a good girl and accept it.
▶Yukino
Or are you gonna go cry to the nice Snow
Queen who gave you eternal beauty?
▶Yukino
What's it gonna be, huh!?
   ▶Yuriko
.. .. ..
▶Yuriko
I...  I don't...
▶Yuriko
I don't like the Snow Queen... 
I really don't.
▶Yuriko
I'm glad... it ended like this...
▶Yuriko
I had fun with you guys. I got to talk
to you... have a nice battle...
▶Yuriko
And now...  I got beaten...
▶Yuriko
It's a good thing.  That's right...
I'm... human.
▶Yuriko
And humans have to die...
▶Yuriko
I was so stupid...
▶Yuriko
Why didn't I understand something
so easy...?
▶Nanjo
What?  Are you crying...?
▶Nanjo
Hmp. Stop your charade. What's your scheme
this time?
▶Nanjo
Did you think you could fool us
that easily?
▶Nanjo
I've had enough of your mockery.
▶Nanjo
You, the Snow Queen's minion, claim of
all things not to like her?
▶Nanjo
Go ahead, pull the other one.
▶Brown
Huh? Geez, are you crying?
▶Brown
I admit I've got a soft spot for a cute
girl in tears, but I know you're faking.
▶Brown
You've gotta be up to no good again.
Well, it's not gonna work this time!
▶Brown
Sure, maybe you coulda fooled someone
else...
▶Brown
But not me! Nnnnope!
▶Brown
I mean, you were all about the Snow Queen,
and now you're saying you don't like her?
▶Brown
Hah! That's a new one on me.
▶Brown
If you're gonna lie, try to come up with
something better than that.
▶Ayase
You idiot!  She's crying for reals!
▶Ayase
Can't you tell!? Ugh, no wonder you still
don't have a girlfriend!
▶Ayase
You don't understand girls at all!
▶Ayase
And c'mon, Yukino, don't be so hard on
her! Give her a chance.
▶Ayase
I don't think she's all that bad.  I...
I can't explain it, but...
  ▶Yuriko
...Thank you.  You're... Yuka, right?
▶Yuriko
I wish we'd met and become friends... 
while I was still alive.
▶Yuriko
To tell you the truth...  I was scared.
▶Yuriko
I used to hang out with my friends,
and we'd go out and have fun...
▶Yuriko
I had a lot of friends and a lot of guys
who said they liked me.
▶Yuriko
Plus, my mom and dad were really sweet.
▶Yuriko
Every day was fun, and I was so happy...
▶Yuriko
I thought, "It just doesn't get better
than this!"
▶Yuriko
But then... I got scared...
▶Yuriko
"If it doesn't get better than this...
Is it all downhill from here?"
▶Yuriko
"For the rest of my life..."
▶Yuriko
"Will I ever be happier than I am now?"
▶Yuriko
"Am I just gonna grow up, get old, turn
ugly... and die...?"
▶Yuriko
I couldn't shake those questions. I got
so scared, I couldn't sleep at night...
▶Yuriko
That's when the Snow Queen's mask I wore
in the play spoke to me.
▶Yuriko
It said, "I can help you live forever,
exactly as you are now."
▶Yuriko
Before I knew it, I was in this tower...
▶Yuriko
And I've been here ever since...
all by myself...
▶Yuriko
Mom... Dad... My friends... All gone.
Just me... I was so selfish!
▶Yuriko
I was stupid for not wanting to die or
grow old! Every human has to!
▶Yuriko
That's why I fell for the Snow Queen's
offer...
▶Yuriko
I was such an idiot!
▶Yuriko
I felt empty, being on my own for so
long...! I wanted to just end it all!
▶Yuriko
I couldn't stand it anymore!
▶Yuriko
That's why... when you guys showed up... 
I was really happy!
▶Yuriko
I'd finally be able to put an end to
this... one way or another...
▶Yuriko
I wouldn't have to be alone anymore! 
That's why I... I...!
  ▶Nanjo
Hmph... I see.
▶Nanjo
Your egotistic, spoiled nature was the
source of your tremendous power.
▶Nanjo
In your state of absolute solitude, that
already unbearable sorrow and regret...
▶Nanjo
It was amplified and warped by the
seemingly infinite time you spent here.
▶Nanjo
The result was boundless sorrow--far more
intense than your initial despair.
▶Nanjo
Thus was born your eccentric demeanor,
providing Thanatos with power.
▶Nanjo
What a fine mess it created! Though...
I suppose it's understandable.
▶Elly
So that overwhelming power that seemed
almost unnatural...
▶Elly
It came from your unfathomable sadness...
▶Elly
The utter loneliness and bottomless grief
you felt...
▶Elly
That gave rise to despair far stronger
than any of your prior feelings.
▶Elly
Combined with your sadness, that was the
root of both your peculiar attitude...
▶Elly
...and the frightening power of your
Persona, Thanatos.
▶Elly
I see now, Yuriko, that you too were
a victim of the Snow Queen.
   ▶Yuriko
But it's finally over...
▶Yuriko
I can't thank you enough.
▶Yuriko
Thanks to all of you...
▶Yuriko
I can die... feeling like a human...
▶Yuriko
I...  I have to go  now...
▶Yuriko
Thank you so much.  Goodbye...

<FirstName>! Hold up the mirror!
▶Ayase
N-No way...
▶Elly
What... What's going on?
▶Brown
......?
What the...? It just flashed.
  ▶Ayase
That can't be right!
▶Ayase
We all tried so hard to gather the
Mirror Shards...
▶Ayase
C-C'mon, let's try holding it up again!
   ▶Yukino
This can't be happening... T-Try again!
   ▶Snow Queen's voice
Ahaha... There's no use in thrusting that
gap-riddled mirror at me.
▶Snow Queen's voice
You've lost.
 ▶Nanjo
What!?
 ▶Brown
Dammit!
▶Snow Queen
Ahahahah... You did well in gathering the
shards, but not well enough, it seems.
▶Snow Queen
Now, come!
▶Snow Queen
Join your Saeko in tasting the eternal
despair of pitch-black night!
▶Snow Queen
Guh... aaah...
▶Yukino
Is it working!?
   ▶Snow Queen
Gyaaaaaaaah! My face... it's buuurniiiing!
▶Burned student
Hoooow daaaare youuuuu...
▶Burned student
Whyyyy... Whyyy dooooes everyyyyone
taaaake... Saekoooo's siiiiide...?
 ▶Ayase
Eeeeeeeeek!
▶Brown
Holy son of a--Wh-Wh-Wh-What the hell!?
▶Elly
Good heavens...
 ▶Ms. Saeko
You've all become so strong in such a
short time.
▶Ms. Saeko
You have a look in your eye that says
there's nothing you can't do.
▶Ms. Saeko
I have a feeling you're capable of taking
care of the rest.
▶Ms. Saeko
Please sever the curse of the mask!
It's brought pain to so many students!
▶Ms. Saeko
I'm counting on you...
▶Yukino
The Night Queen, huh...?
▶Yukino
The bitch said she'd "unleash the snows of
despair from the heights of the castle."
▶Yukino
Maybe there's a passage or something the
Queen used to get up top. Let's find it!
  ▶Yukino
Just a little more, and we've got our
school back... Let's keep it together!
  ▶Ayase
Does it feel a little warmer to you?
Y'think the Queen's losing her power?
▶Ayase
Oh, yeah! Maybe that door that was frozen
shut up to now is open!?
  ▶Ayase
Hey, let's hurry upstairs.
▶Ayase
If my tummy gets cold before we beat the
Queen, I won't be able to focus!
   ▶Nanjo
It's been quite some time since Masao
and Maki left the school.
▶Nanjo
I fear for those two if we don't make
haste and put an end to this...
  ▶Brown
Night Queen? Sounds like some hostess at
a Ginza club. How strong could she be?
▶Brown
You guys'll do just fine without me.
...I'm joking!
▶Brown
C'mon, let's go!
   ▶Elly
In order to sever the mask's curse, we
absolutely must defeat the Night Queen.▶Agastya Tree
Young ones... Your presence is welcome.
 ▶Agastya Tree
Will you inscribe your story on me? 
   ▶Agastya Tree
Take care on your journey, young ones...▶Ayase
We did it!
 ▶Yukino
Ms. Saeko!
▶Yukino
You okay? You must've been so cold...
Are you hurt?
   ▶Ms. Saeko
I'm all right, thank you. But... where
is Tomomi?
  ▶Brown
Tomomi? Who?
   ▶Nanjo
Tomomi...?
 ▶Ms. Saeko
Tomomi is the spirit who was possessing
that mask...
▶Ms. Saeko
She's one of the students who fell under
the Snow Queen's thrall.
▶Ms. Saeko
She's... also my best friend, from when
I used to be in the drama club.
 ▶Yukino
Th-Then... the Snow Queen possessing
you was your friend...?
  ▶Elly
So that's why the Queen seemed to be so
familiar with you...
▶Elly
But whyever would your best friend
possess you?
 ▶Nanjo
Hm. No wonder it seemed to know you.
▶Nanjo
But why would your best friend try to
use you as a sacrifice...?
  ▶Ms. Saeko
I had no idea she thought of me
that way...
▶Ms. Saeko
I guess... sometimes you hurt people
without realizing it...▶Saeko
Congrats on landing the Snow Queen part!
▶Saeko
Our last year here, and you finally
beat me out.
  ▶Tomomi
Thanks. I'll put on a good show for you,
Saeko!
▶Tomomi
But I'm nervous about the mask...
▶Tomomi
Is it true everyone who's played the
Snow Queen's role has been cursed?
   ▶Saeko
Whaaat? Hey, I'm sure that's just some
superstition!
▶Saeko
Just keep up that cheerful attitude and
I bet any curse wouldn't dare touch you!
▶Saeko
That tendency of yours to believe whatever
you hear is the one flaw you have!
▶Tomomi
I wish... I wish I could be as strong
as you, Saeko.
  ▶Saeko
C'mon, don't talk like that! Cheer up!
▶Saeko
You won the title role! What am I supposed
to think if you're not happier about it?
 ▶Tomomi
Y-You're right.
   ▶Drama club member
Whaaaat!? Tomomi, can't you see Saeko is
pulling the wool over your eyes?
  ▶Tomomi
Huh!? She tricked me?
 ▶Drama club member
You didn't know!?
▶Drama club member
Saeko bowed out of contention for the
Snow Queen part.
▶Drama club member
Everyone's been talking about it.
▶Drama club member
They say she forced the part on you
'cause she's scared of the mask's curse.
▶Tomomi
She withdrew... because she's scared of
the curse...? No way!
▶Tomomi
Even if she did bow out, I'm sure she
was just being considerate!
▶Tomomi
We're in the same year, but I've never
gotten a better role than her, so...
 ▶Drama club member
So she's letting you take this last
chance? You're so naive, Tomomi.
▶Drama club member
The Snow Queen is the title role!
▶Drama club member
No one would give it up without a damn
good reason.
 ▶Tomomi
......
▶Saeko
Tomomi? Did you call for me? Is something
the matter...?
▶Saeko
Why are you hiding?
▶Saeko
Well... break a leg tomorrow! I'll be
looking forward to it.
  ▶Tomomi
...Your...  ...ault...
   ▶Saeko
What was that? I can't hear you!
   ▶Tomomi
It'ssss...  your...  faaaaaaault!
▶Tomomi
Yours, Ԙyours, Ԙyours! It'ssss allԘ
your faaaaaault!
  ▶Saeko
Huh!? Tomomi, what's gotten into you!?
Calm down!
  ▶Tomomi
You...  you forced the masssk onto meee...
   ▶Saeko
Tomomi... are you all right? What's this
about the mask?
   ▶Tomomi
The mask... the mask...  suddenly wouldn't
come... off...  it got so hot... hot!
▶Tomomi
My face started...  it started
sizzzzzling...
▶Tomomi
And it's all...  all...  ALL!
   ▶Tomomi
YOUR! FAAAAAAULT!
 ▶Saeko
EeeeԎeԎeԎeԎeek!▶Ayase
But that's, like, totally not your fault.
▶Ayase
You didn't force it on her, right? So
it's all Tomomi's misunderstanding!
▶Ms. Saeko
Maybe so.
▶Ms. Saeko
But...  I can't say with absolute
confidence that that's true.
▶Ms. Saeko
Maybe some part of me really was gloating
over how much better I was.
▶Ms. Saeko
Maybe I was just acting like Tomomi's
best friend, when I never really cared.
▶Ms. Saeko
Maybe I was too in love with the idea of
being "considerate Saeko"...
▶Ms. Saeko
And I only ended up hurting her.
   ▶Yukino
Ms. Saeko...
  ▶Ms. Saeko
It's not the mask's curse! What really
made her that way is--
  ▶Yukino
Enough!
   ▶Ms. Saeko
.. .. ..
 ▶Ayase
Yeesh...  It's so cold...
 ▶Nanjo
......!
How could this be...?
  ▶Elly
Oh! This can't be...
▶Yukino
What's up?
▶Nanjo
We've defeated the Snow Queen and rescued
Ms. Saeko... but nothing's changed!
  ▶Elly
We've defeated the Snow Queen and saved
Ms. Saeko, but the school's still frozen!
   ▶Ayase
Huh. Come to think of it, the sky's
still a weird color...
 ▶Woman's voice
Hmhmhm... You all must be so very cold.
Ahahahahah...
  ▶Ms. Saeko
Wh-What's going on!?
   ▶Brown
Oh crap... oh crap...! Not cool! We just
defeated it!
  ▶Elly
What the--!?
▶Queen
The Tomomi inside me...  The Tomomi with
human weakness is dead. I am grateful.
▶Queen
No longer tied to my host or the mask I
was bound to, I am finally free.
▶Queen
Now I can be complete! I will become the
Night Queen in full!
▶Queen
I shall enshroud this world in black and
white; void and sorrow.
   ▶Yukino
What!?
▶Night Queen
Foolish mortals who cling to hope...
I shall teach you a lesson!
▶Night Queen
I have not yet given up on the
Eternal Night.
▶Night Queen
From the heights of this Ice Castle,
I shall unleash the snows of despair.
▶Night Queen
Hmhmhm...  Ahahahahahaha...
 ▶Ayase
Huh!?▶Ayase
What was that about?
   ▶Elly
The Snow Queen is Tomomi's dark side
made incarnate.
▶Elly
When we held up the Demon's Mirror that
shows all evil, Tomomi...
▶Elly
Rather, the Snow Queen saw for herself
how dissolute her heart had become.
 ▶Nanjo
The Snow Queen symbolizes the darkness
within Tomomi's heart.
▶Nanjo
Thus, by holding up the Demon's Mirror
which reflects all evil, Tomomi...
▶Nanjo
Sorry, the Snow Queen, saw how vile her
heart had become.
  ▶Yukino
I get it! Tomomi saw what she had become
in the mirror and came to her senses.
▶Yukino
Then her Persona, the Night Queen, had
nowhere to go and went berserk.
▶Elly
That's the most likely scenario.
▶Nanjo
Yes, that's probably the case.
 ▶Brown
Thanks for the explanation.
▶Brown
I think I'm finally starting to get
what's going on here.
▶Brown
So if we don't defeat that Queen,
we can't go home or take a hot bath!
   ▶Ayase
Huh... So that means we like, have to
defeat that Night thing too?
 ▶Ms. Saeko
It hasn't been long since this started,
and look how much you've all grown.
▶Ayase
Aww, well, I only made it this far
'cause I had everyone backing me up.
▶Ayase
There's, like, no way I would've made
it by myself...
  ▶Yukino
Yeah, thanks to these guys, well... 
I don't know how to say this, but...
▶Yukino
It's like I understand for the first
time why I'm alive.
  ▶Ayase
Whoa, that sounds REALLY cool!
 ▶Yukino
Sh- Shut up!
Let's go, <FirstName>!
▶Yukino
Night Queen or no Night Queen, this team
has nothing to be afraid of!
 ▶Ms. Saeko
Haha... I'm leaving everyone in your
hands, <FirstName>!
 ▶Yukino
Wh...  What the!?
▶Ayase
Whoa! Is that...?
  ▶Ms. Saeko
Tomomi!
▶Tomomi
Saeko...  everyone...  thank you.
▶Tomomi
It's because of you that I was able to
return to myself.
▶Tomomi
That reflection...  My heart was so awful
that I couldn't look straight at it...
  ▶Yukino
It's not just you, Ms. Tomomi.
▶Yukino
I'm sure anyone's reflection would be
horrible in that mirror.
▶Yukino
Not very many people in the world with
a truly pure heart...
  ▶Brown
Speak for yourself! I'm innocent as a
young girl, pure as an angel, and . . .
▶Brown
Never mind.
   ▶Ayase
I bet I'd look like some kinda monster.
▶Tomomi
If you looked right now, I know you
wouldn't see a monster...
▶Tomomi
I know! You should keep carrying the
Demon's Mirror with you.
▶Tomomi
I bet it would protect you from
misfortune.
▶Tomomi
Though it won't be easy to carry around
in the form of a mirror, so...
 > The Demon's Mirror transformed into
a shield.
   > Obtained Ẅԟ|ԍSpiegel Shield| .
  ▶Tomomi
And I don't know if you'll find a use
for it or not, but...
▶Tomomi
The hero's costume from "The Snow Queen"
should be in storage at the gym.
▶Tomomi
It was kept near the box with the Snow
Queen's mask, to keep the seal strong.
 ▶Yukino
Well, that's one piece of good news.
▶Yukino
No idea where the storage room is in this
Ice Castle...
▶Yukino
But it sounds like it's worth hunting for.
 ▶Tomomi
Ah...  If only I'd met you all sooner...
▶Tomomi
I'll be watching from above with the past
Queens so no one else ends up like us.
▶Tomomi
Thank you.
   ▶Ayase
No way! I'm the one who should be
thanking you!
▶Ayase
I've been hurting a lot of people and
I never even knew before!
▶Ayase
It's people like me that make it hard for
others to trust the ones around them...
  ▶Tomomi

I'm painting over your future with
blackness.
▶Masked girl
Do you know why? 
Why must you get in my way?
▶Masked girl
How can you withstand the pain?
▶Masked girl
You have each other... Ms. Saeko... your
family...  People you can rely on.
▶Masked girl
But I'm always alone. I can only watch
the happiness of others.
▶Yukino
Wait a sec, are you...?
   ▶Masked girl
You can never understand how I feel!
▶Masked girl
I'll destroy this place...  I'll destroy
the whole school!
   ▶Yukino
Maki, wait!
   ▶Yukino
......
> There seems to be nothing here.
 ▶Yukino
Maki...?
  ▶Yukino
Maki...
   ▶Yukino
The paint hasn't dried.
   ▶Ayase
Check out that painting... It's all
black. Freaky...
   ▶Ayase
Check out that painting... It's all
black. Freaky...
   ▶Nanjo
Is this an illusion?
   ▶Nanjo
It can't be... Maki was outside the
school grounds.
▶Nanjo
Was someone just here?
 ▶Brown
Hey, isn't that Maki?
  ▶Brown
Wow, Maki has some weird fashion sense.
You see that mask of hers?
 ▶Brown
Don't any of you understand art?
▶Brown
Her style, her presentation...
Simply amazing.
▶Elly
Be careful! This could be one of the
Queen's traps.
 ▶Elly
But Maki can't possibly be here.
A demon, perhaps...?
   ▶Elly
Someone who wasn't frozen must have
been here fairly recently.▶Girl in white
I can't waste time like this...
▶Girl in white
Excuse me. Have you seen me?
   ▶Ayase
Huh? What's she trying to say?
▶Ayase
Hey, little girl, what are you
doing here?
▶Ayase
You should go home. It's, like, really
dangerous here.
   ▶Nanjo
Yuka! It shouldn't even be possible for
a small girl like her to be here!
▶Nanjo
Her words make no sense, either. She may
not even be human!
  ▶Elly
Ayase! Can't you think rationally for
a change?
▶Elly
How could a small girl be here?
She clearly must be a monster!
   ▶Ayase
Sh-Shut up! Get off my case!
▶Ayase
I thought she was in trouble, so I talked
to her, that's all! I'm not mean like you.
  ▶Girl in white
I'm Mai. I'm not lost, and I'm not
a demon, either.
▶Girl in white
Anyway, have you seen me?
▶Girl in white
I'm wearing clothes like yours, and I
have a white mask on.
  ▶Yukino
You're looking for a student from
this school?
▶Yukino
Sorry, but I don't know anyone who
wears a mask.
  ▶Mai
Oh. Okay.
▶Ayase
H-Hey!
 ▶Yukino
It's that girl we saw before!
 ▶Mai
You saw me!? Where? Tell me, please!
 ▶Yukino
Well... it was on this floor, but I
forget exactly where.
 ▶Mai
Thanks!
  ▶Yukino
It was on the eighth floor, on a kind
of stage. But I think she went upstairs.
▶Yukino
What was that all about...?
   ▶Ayase
I don't think she's a bad kid...
   ▶Nanjo
I remember seeing that girl around
somewhere. Who was she...?
  ▶Brown
Wow, she's a cutie! Give her ten years
or so, and you'll have to hold me back!
 ▶Elly
A little girl alone, here of all
places... It has to be a monster!▶Agastya Tree
Young ones... Your presence is welcome.
 ▶Agastya Tree
Will you inscribe your story on me? 
   ▶Agastya Tree
Take care on your journey, young ones...▶Masked man
I didn't expect you'd take this long.
Have you seen her already?
  ▶Yukino
...Seen who?
  ▶Masked man
She should be painting on the floor
below.
▶Masked man
She's keeping the gate to paradise shut
with the blackness of despair.
▶Yukino
You mean that girl in the art room...?
The one with the white mask?
   ▶Masked man
What did she say?
 ▶Yukino
"I'll destroy the school," or something.
  ▶Masked man
I see. Yes, that does sound like her.
▶Masked man
This iced-over school is a byproduct of
her heart. But it won't affect my plans.
   ▶Ayase
Huh?
   ▶Masked man
I've always believed the public school
system served no purpose.
▶Masked man
Education should be reserved for
society's chosen.
▶Masked man
If she wishes for its destruction, I see
no harm in humoring her.
   ▶Nanjo
You're Kandori, aren't you!?
   ▶Masked man
Perhaps. See if you can figure it out
with that subpar brain of yours.
▶Yukino
Who's the weird guy in a mask...?
 ▶Yukino
There's nothing here. Let's go.
   ▶Ayase
So like, this is the old Student Council
room?
 ▶Ayase
"Love thy neighbor"... Uh, which one?
  ▶Nanjo
......
 ▶Nanjo
Did you find anything useful?
  ▶Brown
I feel like I've seen this guy before.
 ▶Brown
Man, it gets colder and colder the
higher we go.
▶Brown
How many more floors are there? Brrr...
   ▶Elly
He isn't frozen? Who is he...?
  ▶Elly
Is Ayase really in high school...?▶Girl in black
I can't waste time like this!
▶Girl in black
Hey, have you seen my Daddy?
 ▶Ayase
Your Daddy? Huh, maybe she's lost.
▶Ayase
Hey, little girl, what are you
doing here?
▶Ayase
You should go home. It's, like, really
dangerous here.
   ▶Nanjo
Honestly! Do you seriously believe
there'd be a lost child here?
▶Nanjo
Who can say what she has in mind?
Don't let your guard down!
  ▶Elly
Ayase! Won't you please try to be
more cautious?
▶Elly
Your carelessness has gotten us into
a lot of trouble!
▶Elly
I'd appreciate if you made more of an
effort to learn from your mistakes.
 ▶Ayase
Sh-Shut up! Get off my case!
▶Ayase
What if she's really looking for her dad?
Are you gonna leave her by herself!?
▶Girl in black
Um, don't you understand what I'm saying?
▶Girl in black
I'm asking if you saw my Daddy or not!
▶Girl in black
He's wearing clothes like yours and a
black mask.
 ▶Yukino
Sorry, but nobody I know wears a mask.
▶Girl in black
Oh. Okay then.
 ▶Yukino
Him? Yeah, we saw him.
▶Girl in black
Really!? Where was he? C'mon, tell me!
 ▶Yukino
He was in the Student Council room.
It's one floor down.
  ▶Girl in black
Oh, okay.
  ▶Yukino
We saw him one floor up. It was this
place that looked like a stage.
  ▶Yukino
What was that all about...?
   ▶Ayase
What's a little girl doing here?
   ▶Nanjo
I'm sure I've seen that girl somewhere.
▶Nanjo
Where was it...?
   ▶Brown
Sassy girls like that... I'm not too
good at dealing with them.
▶Elly
She has to be a monster!▶Agastya Tree

   ▶Agastya Tree

Hmhm... You came all the way up here?
▶Night Queen
It would have been easier if you'd just
waited for the Eternal Night to fall.
▶Night Queen
But if you insist... I shall grant your
wish with despair.
▶Night Queen
You won't find me as easy as Tomomi. 
Hmhmhmhm...
  ▶Masked girl
Why are you trying so hard to protect
this place?
▶Masked girl
I hate school...  I wish it would
disappear from the face of the earth!
 ▶Masked man
Allow us to assist you, Night Queen.
▶Masked man
Though it's a bit crowded here for the
three of us to combine our strength...
▶Masked man
I invite you all to the uppermost floor. 
You may take your time in coming to us.
   ▶Masked man
Are you ready?
▶Masked man
Have you made your preparations to
advance to the next floor? 
   ▶Masked man
Very well.
▶Masked man
Then resume your training.
▶Masked man
Whether this side or that prevails in
the end... It's no concern of mine.
 ▶Yukino
Let's go!
 ▶Ayase
I'm all set!
   ▶Nanjo
......
 ▶Brown
Our happy ending's just around the corner.
And once this place is back to normal...
▶Brown
There'll be a new school legend--the
amazing Brown and his decent flunkies!
▶Brown
Mwahahahah!  C'mon, let's get to it!
  ▶Elly
I'm glad this freezing cold won't last
much longer.▶Agastya Tree
Young ones... Your presence is welcome.
 ▶Agastya Tree
Will you inscribe your story on me? 
   ▶Agastya Tree
Take care on your journey, young ones...▶Night Queen
I've been waiting for you.
   ▶Masked girl
No more school! Ever!
▶Masked man
Let's see what you can do.▶Night Queen's voice
Urgh... I failed... against these youths?
How distressing...
▶Night Queen's voice
But heed my words...
▶Night Queen's voice
Eternal night will fall again so long as
people seek to turn hope to despair...
▶Masked girl
No... How could this happen!?
▶Masked girl
This is my world...!
 ▶Masked man
As I thought. Improvising didn't suffice,
and we must take matters into our hands.
▶Masked man
Your name was <LastName>, yes? I have
a feeling we'll see each other again.▶Agastya Tree
Young ones... Your presence is welcome.
 ▶Agastya Tree
Will you inscribe your story on me? 
   ▶Agastya Tree
Take care on your journey, young ones...▶Ms. Saeko
You're really going?
   ▶Nanjo
Yes. I'm worried about Maki and Masao.
▶Nanjo
And something else, too...
▶Nanjo
That student in that white mask reminded
me somewhat of Maki.
▶Elly
Yes! I hope Maki and Mark are okay.
▶Elly
I have something else on my mind, too...
▶Elly
That girl with the white mask looked
just like Maki.
 ▶Yukino
Yeah, there's still some business we
gotta take care of.
  ▶Yukino
Right, <FirstName>? 
   ▶Yukino
We gotta find Maki...
▶Yukino
She looked like she was in pain to me.
 ▶Yukino
*sigh* What can I say? You'll get it
sooner or later.
 ▶Ms. Saeko
...Alright. Then you go do what you
gotta do!
▶Ms. Saeko
You're adults now, setting out on your
own. I won't stop you.
▶Ms. Saeko
But promise me this...
 ▶Ayase
Huh? Like what?
▶Ms. Saeko
Come back and see me before you get
all old and wrinkled!
▶Ms. Saeko
And come back to report in when it's
all over with!
  ▶Yukino
Oh, we will, don't worry about that!
We're your best students, remember?
  ▶Ms. Saeko
She says, while wearing an outfit that's
against the dress code.
▶Ms. Saeko
You should try being in my shoes, getting
yelled at every day by the vice principal!
  ▶Ms. Saeko
Haha... it looks like this incident has
given him second thoughts, though.
▶Ms. Saeko
He asked me to thank you guys.
▶Ms. Saeko
Maybe now he won't be so strict...
for a while, at least.
▶Ayase
Hah! That cueball? As if!
  ▶Ms. Saeko
Oh, he's not really all that bad.
▶Ms. Saeko
But anyway! You should stop chitchatting
and get going before it's too late!
 ▶Yukino
Right!
▶Brown
C'mon, what's there to worry about?
I'll be with them!
▶Brown
C'mon, honey... Don't spoil that pretty
face with tears.
▶Brown
Mwahahahaha!
   ▶Elly
The school's returned to normal...
▶Elly
But that's only the beginning.
▶Elly
Our true battle comes later. First, we
must restore peace to our city.
▶Elly
We're still young... there's a lot of
life yet to fight through.
▶Elly
I'll rise to the challenge!
   ▶Nanjo
Where there's a will, there's a way...
That's how I feel with friends like these.
▶Nanjo
Rest assured, Ms. Saeko, we'll find
Masao and Maki!
▶Nanjo
Let's go, <FirstName>!
 ▶Ayase
Y'know, up to now, I've just been doing
whatever I feel like...
▶Ayase
But when I see Yukino and the others try
so hard, I feel like I can do way better.
▶Ayase
I dunno how exactly, but that can wait
until after we save the town.
▶Ayase
Catch you later, Ms. Saeko!
▶Yukino
Once the town's back to normal, I'm going
to hit the books.
▶Yukino
Just you watch! I'll be just as awesome
a teacher as you, Ms. Saeko!
▶Yukino
Haha... I'll see you later, yeah?
  ▶Ms. Saeko
Thanks for everything, <FirstName>!
▶Ms. Saeko
Looks like they have ideas for their
future. How about you?
  ▶Ms. Saeko
Do you have a future in mind? 
▶Ms. Saeko
Great!
▶Ms. Saeko
You've done something amazing here.
Savor that feeling and give it your all!
▶Ms. Saeko
I see...
▶Ms. Saeko
Well, you're still young. No need to rush.
Anyway, look after them for me, okay?
  ▶Ms. Saeko
Phew. Now then...
  ▶Ms. Saeko
Hm? Hey there, little guy. Where did
you come from?
▶Ms. Saeko
Are you here to wish them luck, too?
Haha...▶Agastya Tree

   ▶Agastya Tree

Masao!
 ▶Brown
M-Mark!?
   ▶Ayase
Huh? Hey, where's Maki?
▶Mark
Oh, man... Guys, I need your help!
  ▶Yukino
Did something happen to Maki?
 ▶Mark
I'm sorry... I never shoulda let it
happen...
▶Mark
We went to the SEBEC building, but the
demons inside got her.
▶Mark
They're pretty tough, and I don't think
I can handle 'em on my own.
   ▶Yukino
What!?
▶Elly
We must rescue her, quickly!
▶Brown
Aha! Now's the time for the amazing hero
Brown and his flunkies to shine!
  ▶Yukino
Alright!
  ▶Everyone
Let's go!▶Agastya Tree
Young ones... Your presence is welcome.
 ▶Agastya Tree
Will you inscribe your story on me? 
   ▶Agastya Tree
Take care on your journey, young ones...▶Ayase
Did that do it...?
 ▶Yukino
Where's Ms. Saeko!?
   ▶Voice
Hmhmhm...
▶Voice
Ahahahaha...!
▶Ayase
Wh-Who's that!?
▶Queen
Saeko, your beacon of hope, has become
a sacrifice... as did Tomomi.
▶Queen
I am the Persona known as Night Queen,
who once dwelled within Tomomi.
▶Night Queen
You have my thanks. I am at last freed
from my host and the mask that bound me.
▶Night Queen
And once the Eternal Night arrives,
I shall be complete.
▶Night Queen
I shall enshroud this world in black and
white; nothingness and despair.
▶Night Queen
Ahahahahahahaha...!
  ▶Yukino
What!?
▶Night Queen
Fools! Open your eyes and witness the
advent of the Eternal Night.
▶Night Queen
From the heights of this Ice Castle,
I shall unleash the snows of despair.
▶Night Queen
Hmhmhm... Ahahahahahaha!
   ▶Yukino
H-Hey! Wait!▶Ayase
Omigod...
  ▶Ayase
They're frozen!
▶Brown
It's over...
   ▶Nanjo
This is... unthinkable...
  ▶Ayase
It's... It's all a bad joke, right,
Nurse Natsumi!?
▶Ayase
C'mon, Tsutomu! I'm talking to you!
▶Ayase
Please... say something...
 ▶Yukino
Look through the hole... The whole town
is frozen over...
 ▶Elly
Then... the only ones left alive are...
 ▶Brown
H-Hold on... does that mean...?
▶Ayase
We're all that's left!? No one else
made it...?
▶Ayase
I did the best I could... We all did,
didn't we!?
▶Ayase
How could it have ended like this?
▶Ayase
No... No, no, no... NO!

What's gonna happen to us...?▶Agastya Tree
