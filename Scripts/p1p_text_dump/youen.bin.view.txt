彻 Ԃ츛ઢ츛ങ츛ച츛  蛳 Ἑ̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺You want me? Hmm... it doesn't SEEM
like you're lying...
   Wow, you're young... you have a pretty
level head to try and persuade a demon!
   Hey! Don't just say the first thing that
pops into your head!
  Something seems fishy... Do you really
mean what you say?
Whatever you say, you're still interested
in me, right? With a figure like mine,
you must be!
  So that's why you need my help!
  I see. You have that much confidence in
yourself? I'd love to put that to
the test!
You seem pretty strong. So... what are
you going to do to me, hmm?
  Oh, is that so? If you prefer, I wouldn't
mind fighting you without holding back!
  Well, if nothing else, you have quite the
silver tongue. Where'd you learn to talk
like that?
Why are you threatening me...?
 Don't make such awful faces...
   You want me? Hmm... it doesn't SEEM
like you're lying...
   You're young, but you've got backbone,
inviting a demon to come along.
   Hey! Don't just say the first thing that
pops into your head!
  Something seems fishy... Do you really
mean what you say?
I'm not into that kind of thing...
 Psh! You're just sweet-talking me so
you can kidnap me!
  You've got a nice voice for a human...
Let's hear what it sounds like when
you scream!
 Is that a challenge to a fellow chanteuse?
Then I accept!
You're... better than me...! What am
I supposed to do?
 You're killing my brain cells!
Stop, please!
 You've got a long way to go to catch up
to me... but you're pretty good!
   *dreamy sigh*
You want me? Hmm... it doesn't SEEM
like you're lying...
   Wow, you're young... you have a pretty
level head to try and get a demon's help!
 Hey! Don't just say the first thing that
pops into your head!
  Something seems fishy... Do you really
mean what you say?
Whatever you say, you're still interested
in me, right? With a figure like mine,
you must be!
  So that's why you need my help!
  Don't you have any pride? I hate mousy
girls like you!
 Stop trying the obvious! Don't think I
don't know what you're really after!
  Hey, stop it... You're creeping me out...
  Oh, no, I'm nothing compared to the
others. And may I say you look as strong
as always, ჩ...
 Yes! That's how things should be!
Kneel before me!
 Ahhh... Why am I so perfect?
My own greatness frightens me...
In other words, you want me? Hmm...
it doesn't SEEM like you're lying...
   Wow, you're young, but you think about
things like that, too. Good for you!
  Hey! Don't just say the first thing that
pops into your head!
  Something seems fishy... Do you really
mean what you say?
Whatever you say, you're still interested
in me, right? With a figure like mine,
you must be!
  So when you get down to it, you need
my help!
You seem to have an innate understanding
of your true strength. That's a very
good thing.
  Oh, my... I was afraid you were an idiot,
but you're actually very smart.
Don't you have any pride? I hate mousy
girls like you!
 Stop trying the obvious! Don't think I
don't know what you're really after!
  Yes! That's how things should be!
Kneel before me!
 Ahhh... Why am I so perfect?
My own greatness frightens me...
You're hitting on a demon? What an odd
boy... Still, you're a cute one!
I... I guess I wouldn't mind having
dinner with you...
   Hey! I'm out of your league, kid!
  I'm not the easy pickup you think I am!
  I'm scaaaaaared!
   I'm scaaaaaared!
   Reaaaally? Awwww, no way! But I already
have a boyfriend, so... sorry.
 Are you hitting on me? Ahaha...
What should I do...?
 Someone like you is actually very smart.
   What was that?
   Enough is enough!
  What's so interesting about that?
...Laaaaame...
 What's wrong!? You suddenly blurted out
a joke!
  You're pretty funny! Not as funny as your
face, though.
No way, you're funny! Want to debut as
a pro? I'll be your manager.
  Huh, is that so...? The human world
sounds complicated too.
Don't you have more interesting news?
I don't care about that stuff. If you're
going to tell a story, make it a more
interesting one!
This isn't the place for small talk!
Take this seriously!
Then I'll tell you an interesting story
afterwards, too!
   All girls love gossip!
   All that, just to get my attention?
You're such a child...
 What was that?
   Wh-What the!? Sheesh! Don't surprise me
like that!
 What was that for!? You moron!
   Eeeeek! Wh-What was that for?
  I won't do anything, okay? Relax...
  Is that a present for me? Oooh, hurry up
and hand it over!
 Rich, huh? I want more!
  Are you trying to sway me with gifts?
Hah! You won't win me over that way!
 If you must give me a gift, make it
a better one than that!
  It's been so long since I last got a
present... What a great day!
  It feels great to get gifts!
 In other words, you want me? Hmm...
it doesn't SEEM like you're lying...
   Wow, you're young... but you seem pretty
reliable. Impressive!
   Hey! Don't just say the first thing that
pops into your head!
  Something seems fishy... Do you really
mean what you say?
Whatever you say, you're still interested
in me, right? With a figure like mine,
you must be!
  So that's why you need my help!
  I see. You have that much confidence in
yourself? I'd love to put that to
the test!
You seem pretty strong. So... what are
you going to do to me, hmm?
  Oh, is that so? Well, I wouldn't mind
fighting you!
Well, if nothing else, you have quite the
silver tongue. Where'd you learn to talk
like that?
You don't have to threaten me like that...
 Don't make such awful faces...
   You've got a hell of a mouth for a brat...
Well, I'll forgive you this time.
   If you don't learn at least a few
manners, you won't live very long.
 You act like a grownup, but you've got
a lot to learn about how to treat women!
I've been alive for much longer than you!
Watch how you speak to me!
 I'll start to blush if you keep praising
me that much!
 Heehee... you're smart!
  Not bad, not bad at all! I'm good at
doing sexy dances too, you know!
  You're good! Teach me that one too when
we meet again!
   You're not ready for prime time yet.
Come back when you've practiced more!
 Hey, what're you doing!? Do you need to
use the restroom?
Oh, how wonderful! I'm going to
dance, too!
I'm so excited, I could dance the
night away!
I see. You have that much confidence in
yourself? I'd love to put that to
the test!
You seem pretty strong. So... what are
you going to do to me, hmm?
  Oh, is that so? Well, I wouldn't mind
fighting you!
Well, if nothing else, you have quite the
silver tongue. Where'd you learn to talk
like that?
You don't have to threaten me like that...
 Don't make such awful faces...
   Is my makeup messed up?
If you keep that up, you'll stare a hole
right through me!
   What's with that glare? I don't like it!
   What're you looking at!?
 Look at you, gazing at me so dreamily...
It's well-said that beauty is a sin.
  What's the matter? Have you never seen
anyone so radiant as myself?
  Was that a lie? Nah... didn't seem
like it...
  Wow, is that the kind of life you've led?
You've been through a lot, haven't you?
Hey! Don't just say the first thing that
pops into your head!
  Something seems fishy... Do you really
mean what you say?
Whatever you say, you're still interested
in me, right? With a figure like mine,
you must be!
  I don't really get it, but I can see you
need my help!
   That story is nonsense! Anything nowadays
can be proved by science!
I have a story like that too! Honestly,
don't you think it's so rude?
N-No... stop it! Why'd you go and tell
a story like that!?
 I can't handle stories like that!
Please stop!
   I know a much scarier story. Wanna hear?
 Do you know a lot of stories like that?
Then do you know any good haunted places
to dare people to enter?
Wow, that's an amazing voice. You really
can do anything!
  Let's try a duet next time! I'll sing
Corin's part!
  You've got a nice voice for a human...
Let's hear what it sounds like when
you scream!
 Is that a challenge to a fellow chanteuse?
Then I accept!
You've got a long way to go to catch up
to me... but you're pretty good!
   *dreamy sigh*
Now this is an interesting approach!
What ish it you're planning, Mommy?
   Heehee... Do I look that young?
  You think you know so much, huh?
Come back and see me in a hundred years!
  How rude! You don't even show any manners
when negotiating!
  That's odd... For some reason, I feel
all nostalgic.
   Squeeee! This is so fun!
 You want me? Hmm... it doesn't SEEM
like you're lying...
   You're young, but you've got backbone,
inviting a demon to come along.
   Hey! Don't just say the first thing that
pops into your head!
  Something seems fishy... Do you really
mean what you say?
Whatever you say, you're still interested
in me, right? With a figure like mine,
you must be!
  So that's why you need my help!
  You've got a hell of a mouth for a brat...
Well, I'll forgive you this time.
   If you don't learn at least a few
manners, you won't live very long.
 You think you know so much, huh?
Come back and see me in a hundred years!
  How rude! You have no manners at all!
Th-That's not true... *sniff*
  Wh-What's the deal here!? Just because
you're young and cute... Grrrr! Oooh,
I'm so jealous!
 You're one odd girl. Cute, though!
 I... I guess I wouldn't mind going out
to dinner with you...
 Sorry, but I'm only interested in men!
 Then come over here! I'll show you love,
<Name>-style!
Oooh, really? See you later, then!
 Are you sure? I'm going to take you at
your word, you know...
Poor thing... you gotta hang in there!
 My... you're going through a lot for
someone your age.
   Girls like you always use the most
cliched tactics! Why don't you try
something original for a change?
 Oh, every demon knows you... Ayase,
the Pseudo-Sobber!
   Hey, don't cry! You make it look like
I'm bullying you!
Huh? C'mon, you don't have to cry...
 I see. You have that much confidence in
yourself? I'd love to put that to
the test!
You seem pretty strong. So... what are
you going to do to me, hmm?
  Oh, is that so? Well, I wouldn't mind
fighting you!
Well, if nothing else, you have quite the
silver tongue. Where'd you learn to talk
like that?
You don't have to threaten me like that...
 Don't make such awful faces...
   You think you know so much, huh?
Come back and see me in a hundred years!
  How rude! You don't even show any manners
when negotiating!
  U-Um, I'm sorry...
 I didn't do anything... Why are you
treating me like this!?
  This is a new experience for me...
I like it, though!
  I'm sorry, Mistress... Bully me more!
It doesn't seem like you're just making
it all up...
   Wow, you're young... but you have a
pretty level head. Good for you!
 Hey! Don't just say the first thing that
pops into your head!
  Something seems fishy... Do you really
mean what you say?
Whatever you say, you're still interested
in me, right? With a figure like mine,
you must be!
  So basically, that's why you need
my help!
   You think you know so much, huh?
Come back and see me in a hundred years!
  How rude! You have no manners at all!
U-Um, I'm sorry...
 I didn't do anything... Why are you
treating me like this!?
  Heehee! You're quite a rambunctious girl.
  I'm sorry, Mistress... Bully me more!
You've got backbone. If that's for real,
then it's pretty amazing.
 Oh? Aren't you going to negotiate
with me?
   You've got backbone, but that's not
the kind of attitude you should be
showing me!
 Are you trying to ignore me? How dare you
make a fool of me!
 ...I haven't done anything, have I?
Um... Um, sorry about that...
You've got backbone. If that's for real,
then it's pretty amazing.
 Oh? Aren't you going to negotiate
with me?
   You've got backbone, but that's not
the kind of attitude you should be
showing me!
 Are you trying to ignore me? How dare you
make a fool of me!
 ...I haven't done anything, have I?
Um... Um, sorry about that...
I see. You have that much confidence in
yourself? I'd love to put that to
the test!
You seem pretty strong. So... what are
you going to do to me, hmm?
  Oh, is that so? Well, I wouldn't mind
fighting you!
Well, if nothing else, you have quite the
silver tongue. Where'd you learn to talk
like that?
You don't have to threaten me like that...
 Don't make such awful faces...
   Wh-What the!? Sheesh! Don't surprise me
like that!
 What was that for!? You moron!
   Eeeeek! Wh-What was that for?
  I won't do anything, okay? Relax...
  What an odd boy... Still, you're a
cute one!
   You're dangerous! But I like that in
a man!
  All that, just to get my attention?
You're such a child...
 Wooooow! You can use spells!?
I can't believe it... a human,
using spells...
 I haven't done anything, right...? You
won't make me disappear or anything?
  Wooooow! Can you pull anything out of
that? I think I just hit the jackpot
with this negotiation!
  You're not that famous magician, are you?
Ummm... Who-dini?
  That's an interesting story! Hey, tell
me more!
You must be really interested in me if
you're saying all that!
 I don't mind hearing you out, but you
have to do something for me first!
  This is no fun... What a letdown.
  Stop going on and on about that
stupid crap!
   Will you shut up already!? You're making
me mad! Give me something or else!
   You get this scary look in your eyes when
you talk to me... Are you under someone's
control...?
If that's what you want to talk about,
I think someone else would understand
it better than me...
  Heehee... I haven't felt this nice in
a while.
 Heehee... You say such cute things!
You're good at making small talk...
I'd like to chat a little more.
You want me? Heehee... What should
I do...?
I like how you started this. If you give
me something, I might really listen to
what you have to say.
 Lend you my power...? But you're still
just a kid... Let me think about it.
I'm not interested in kids like you in
the slightest.
  Boring! If you want to negotiate, do
something more interesting!
   Hmph! That was pitiful... Who do you
think I am? I'm ც <Name>!
If you really want my help, listen to
what I have to say!
  I feel like there's something else at
work here...
 Aren't you a human...? You shouldn't be
asking demons for help.
If you have a request, try some other
demon--not me.
   Ahaha... What should I do...?
  Ahaha... It's so nice to hear that you
need me!
I simply love being asked favors...
Ask me another one!
...Wait a second! I think I deserve
something from you first.
What's with that attitude? Are you trying
to make me mad on purpose? Something's
strange about this...
 It's useless to try and get me angry.
Not a bad try, though.
   It's no use doing that. There are better
ways to get your opponent's interest.
How dare you make fun of me! I hope
you're prepared for the consequences!
  You really make me mad! But then, if you
didn't... you wouldn't be worth killing!
  How dare you make a fool out of me!?
Now I'm really mad! I'm not going to
calm down unless you give me something!
 You're making fun of me...?
You're so cruel...
 This isn't how a normal negotiation goes...
Wh-What the...? I can't figure out what
you're trying to accomplish...
 Wow, that attitude... You must be really
self-confident! I like that!
  I'll let a couple rude things slide here
and there. Kids should be aggressive!
 Ahaha... You're trying to figure out what
I like... That's so cute!
Hm? Are you a budding entertainer?
Remember to give me credit when you
make it big.
Don't you need some practice? Let's try
this again after you brush up on your
skills. I'll be looking forward to it!
   I feel like something's missing...
I can give you advice, but I'll expect
payment for it!
 What was that about? It was so inane
that I feel like you should die!
  You suck! Get off the stage!
   You want money for THAT? Ha! What a joke!
I think I'll take YOUR money instead!
   What is that...? I don't understand!
   Is this some forbidden ritual of black
magic? It doesn't have anything to do
with me, right...?
Ahaha... Well done. I'd like to hear
that again!
   Marvelous! I wonder if I should learn
something too.
   Bravissimo! Encore, encore!
Humans, huh...? Might be a good way
to kill time.
  Heehee... Will you talk a while with an
old lady like me, too?
 So you want me? I don't mind if you try
to deceive me, but I prefer generous
types!
   Are you making fun of me?
  I'm not so foolish a demon as to betray
my comrades over something like that!
  What're you doing? Wait... you're not
trying to seduce me, are you!?
The other demons will tear you apart if
they find out you seduced me! How badly
do you want me to keep this secret...?
  Wait a second... I-I wouldn't know what
to do even if you told me something
like that...
   Wait a second... I-I wouldn't know what
to do even if you told me something
like that...
   Wait a second... I-I wouldn't know what
to do even if you told me something
like that...
   Ahaha...
   Awesome!
   I... I feel like I'm falling for you!
  Is that supposed to be a compliment!?
You're not really that weak, are you...?
 That's right! You understand just how
dreadful I am.
Which means you'll give me something,
won't you!?
   Don't bother stating the obvious!
You can't even compare to me!
Hmph! You've got another thing coming if
you think I'll forgive you with that!
 If that's the case, I don't mind making
you my slave!
But first, you need to make me want you!
   You're scheming something, aren't you...?
  Are you really angry...? Hey, you're
actually mad, aren't you? Awww...
 Ohohohoho! Humans are nothing but slaves
for demons!
   Ohohohoho! Now beg for your life!
Or else I'll rip you to shreds!
 Ohohohoho! So even humans can grasp
my greatness!
  You already have my spell card, right?
Make me into a beautiful Persona!
   Then I'll give you this.
   Oh, is that so?
It's a shame, but it seems like our
interests are too different.
   Hey, aren't you a little cocky for
a greenhorn?
It's useless to negotiate unless you're
mature enough to handle it!
   In any case, I'll give you this to
commemorate our meeting.
Well, I hope we meet again!
This isn't much... but you can have
it, too.
   Well, I'm pretty busy, so...
   Here's my spell card. Make me into a
Persona with beauty and brawn!
I'll give you this, just forgive me!
   I'm tired of negotiating with you.
There's no depth to your technique!
 I'm tired of negotiating with you.
Children who can't even negotiate
should just take this and run along!
  I'm so irritated with myself being too
stupid even to negotiate with humans!
   I give up! I'll give you my spell card!
This is my first time negotiating with
someone as strong and funny as you...
   Here, a small gift from me... I hope
it helps.
 I can't fight you...
   I'll give you this. Please take good
care of it.
   ...Though if I give you my card, it could
be helpful...
I'll hand over my spell card... please,
forgive me!
Oooh, what a fine man... Hello there.
What brings you here?
  I'm not trying to be rude in saying
this... but you wear some weird clothes.
   This is my first time seeing a human.
Mind giving me something to mark the
occasion?
  Hey! You there! You're in my way!
Could you move over a skosh?
   Don't even start with me today! If you
try anything funny, I'll beat the tar
out of you! Got that!?
I bet I'm the only demoness negotiating
with humans with such a beautiful, full
moon out! Honestly!
So, did you bring any presents for me?
Ugh, you're so inconsiderate! Give me
something!
  You're a human, right...? You shouldn't
come in past this line...
...That's one scary face...
That's one scary face... I'm sure not
getting any sleep tonight...
 Oh my, a human! The strangest things have
been happening to me lately. How are you?
  Oooh, what a fine man... Hey, you don't
have anything against demon girls, hm...?
  Heeheehee...
   You know, if you don't have any business
with me, I have other things to do.
I really wish you would've talked to me
first, you know! You're such a coward.
What an ordinary face... I'm a little
disappointed...
Well, I'll let it slide. I'll hear you
out anyway if you give me something.
   Um... If there's nothing you want,
I'm going to leave.
  Y-You... smell of blood... Sheesh, how
do I always attract the weirdos...?
Anyways, let's talk. Keep that weapon
tucked away, all right?
 If I said I wanted to go with you,
what would you do?
   You... me... it was meant to happen!
Now, let's negotiate!
Oooh, what a fine man... This is my
big chance! Now, let's negotiate!
 Uh-oh, a human! Eeeek! EeeeeeEEEEEEEEEK!
Hey... what's that hovering over you...!?
Yikes! Don't look at me!
I-If you kill me, I'll curse the next
eight generations of your family!
   Hey! What's the big idea, answering
my call!?
Don't tell me you think YOU'RE good
enough for me!
ძ   I don't get the sense that negotiating
with you will be very exciting... but
I'll give you a shot anyway!
 Why'd you answer me? Oh, I get it!
You came to give me a gift, right?
You have scary eyes... what are you going
to do to me...!?
წ  I'm in the strangest mood right now!
I just don't care anymore... Do whatever
you want to me!
 I'm s-scared of you... but I'm also
hoping for something. What's gotten
into me...?
You're interesting! So, what do you want?
I'm in the mood to listen.
   I won't gain anything by spending more
time with you. In fact, I feel like I've
wasted my time!
I-I'm scared... it looks like my luck's
run out...
 Aaaahahaha! You know what it takes to
keep a demon happy.
  I can't spend all day negotiating with
you! Tell me what you want!
 I'll listen... just don't do anything
cruel, okay?
 Ahahah... I'm glad I met you.
I'll grant any desire you have!
  Ugh! I'm annoyed AND I'm feeling a chill
down my spine! Hey, Master!
Please punish these--hey, where'd he go!?
Well, it's about time to draw a line
under this. I can't play with you
all day.
I'm enjoying this, but it's scary, too...
Guess I should be a good demon and obey.
 Let's see, I'll take <Amount> yen.
Heehee... thanks.
  What!? You don't even have that much?
Frickin' bums!
   What!? You don't even have that much?
Sheesh! I can't believe this!
There's no use saving all that money.
It'll all be mine in the end!
...If you didn't want to negotiate, you
should've said so from the start...
I want a life stone.
   Heehee... thanks.
  What, you were negotiating without any
life stones? Uggggh, you're the worst!
  No way! It's just common sense to carry
life stones with you!
  What!? You don't deserve any life stones!
  You've been negotiating without any life
stones? You gotta be kidding me...
Are you for real...?
   Heehee... You have a ,
don't you? That's what I want.
 This shine... It never stops being
wonderful, no matter how many times
I look at it...
 Hey! Isn't there something wrong here?
 Oh, is that so? Then I'll just have to
take it by force!
   No way! Not even if it's me asking?
You can't appreciate beauty, can you?
  I want your life... Well, just a little
of it, really. A small sip is enough.
  Heehee... your life energy looks
delicious!
Oh...? Are you scared of me? I'm even
scarier to kids who don't listen to what
I tell them!
Oh, is that so? I don't want to take any
if you don't want to give... Well, I'll
let it go this once.
  Oh, is that so?
I think it's cute when you do that.
Even if that's true, you're not supposed
to say so yourself!
   Is that so? All right, then.
   Is that so? All right, then.
   I can't trust you!
 Ahaha... I understand very well now.
You're not bad at all.
Is that so!
Ahaha... You're so cute when you're
embarrassed.
   That's what you have to say for yourself
after taunting me? Ahaha... you have
quite the silver tongue.
 What do you mean, something bad!?
Let's see you try!
   N-No way... What did I do...?
  That's what I thought! The sentence
structure's all wrong. You're such
an idiot!
   That's what I thought! The sentence
structure's all wrong.
 Huh? Really? What ARE they teaching
them in schools today...?
  Thanks... that's nice of you!
  Don't get conceited!
   Why...? I'm just a weak demoness...
Oh, is that so?
I think it's cute when you do that.
Even if that's true, you're not supposed
to say so yourself!
   Is that so? All right, then.
   Is that so? All right, then.
   I can't trust you!
 Uh-oh...
   Ahaha... you're honest in the strangest
ways!
  Now I'm even more suspicious...!
   Well, bring it on! I'm not responsible
if you lose your voice!
 Hm, you seem pretty confident.
...Let's call it off for now!
   Hmhmhm, you must've gotten scared.
No surprise there!
  *gasp* *gasp* I've never been treated
so cruelly before...
 Enough is enough!
  Ahhh... that was marvelous...
  That voice... I can't believe it's coming
from a human! What ARE you...?
   That voice... I can't believe it's coming
from a human!
What are you so embarrassed about?
 I think it's cute when you do that.
Even if that's true, you're not supposed
to say so yourself!
   Is that so? All right, then.
   Is that so? All right, then.
   I can't trust you!
 Ahaha... I understand very well now.
You're not bad at all.
Is that so!
Ahaha... You know you want me, but it's
cute that you're so embarrassed about it.
  So you're going to keep pretending you
don't know?
 You're one stubborn girl! Heh... it's
a welcome challenge.
 Don't give me that crap! I'm not falling
for your silver tongue!
   Man, you're so modest!
 You know... you being so modest makes
me anxious...
C'mon, I was just flattering you!
  That wasn't a joke at all, you know!
   C-C'mon... I've just always wanted to
say that!
You think so, too? Ah... I'm such a
sinful woman!
  What're you all embarrassed about?
 I think it's cute when you do that.
Even if that's true, you're not supposed
to say so yourself!
   Is that so? All right, then.
   Is that so? All right, then.
   I can't trust you!
 Ahaha... I understand very well now.
You're not bad at all.
Is that so!
Ahaha... You know you want me, but it's
cute that you're so embarrassed about it.
  What!? You got a problem!?
 Oh my, I'm sorry.
  That's what I thought...
   So you're going to keep pretending you
don't know?
 You're one stubborn girl! Heh... it's
a welcome challenge.
 Don't give me that crap! I'm not falling
for your silver tongue!
   That wasn't a joke at all, you know!
   C-C'mon... I've just always wanted to
say that!
You think so, too? Ah... I'm such a
sinful woman!
  That "mwahahaha" laugh of yours really
makes me sick, you know!
Um... it'll just be dinner, okay...?
   You're a shy one! But that's all right...
I understand!
If you understand, I'll let it slide.
  What, you don't believe me? It's true!
Urgh, you annoy me!
 That's right! It was a lie!
Huh? But... we just met, and...
I'm going to pass after all.
   Can I trust you? I'm a little nervous...
   You're right... it might be good to
kick back once in a while...
   Hey! Tell me!
  Why won't you tell me? Ohhh, I get it!
That's your plan to get my attention, huh?
  Huh? That was a joke...?
(What should I do...?)
Explain it all you want, it won't make
boring stuff any less boring!
   Will you give it a rest!? You don't have
a talented bone in your body!
 It's interesting this time!
Is that so? You have a hidden agenda,
don't you...
 Ahaha... Is that so?
   You seem dangerous...
  Ahaha... I'm sorry. I was only joking.
 Whew... That was just a joke!
  It was a lie. Don't take it so seriously.
  Huh? Seriously!? I want to hear that!
  Hmph, fine! Humans probably don't have
anything worth knowing anyways!
 Awwww, lame!
   Sheesh... You don't listen to what other
people have to say at all...
  Didn't I just say to take this seriously!?
 Is that so? Then do whatever you want!
 I don't like your attitude. It seems like
you're making fun of me...
   Sheesh... making fun of me like that...!
   Well, SORRY!
   Hey! Tell me!
  Why won't you tell me? Ohhh, I get it!
That's your plan to get my attention, huh?
  Huh? Is that so? I don't understand what
you're trying to do, though...
I can't keep up with this.
 If you die, I bet everyone will
just laugh!
I-I'm sorry...
 Whew... At least you can listen...
 What's with you? You're disgusting!
Yikes... what's with you...?
   Men fall so easily for a pretty face...
Looks like you're no different.
I just need to bat my eyes, and I've got
you wrapped around my finger! You're so
easy to manipulate.
   Meanie!
You're right, that was vulgar...
I'm sorry.
What's with that tone of voice!?
Don't act all holier-than-thou!
   
You're so good-natured. Heehee...  Wow... That was a cool way to say it...
Yep, I'm happy! So give me more!
   What, I'm not allowed to be happy!?
I don't like your wording very much!
   Hmhmhm, eh.?
 Ahaha... I think it's cute when you
do that.
   Even if that's true, you're not supposed
to say so yourself!
   Is that so? All right, then.
   Is that so? All right, then.
   I can't trust you!
 Ahaha... I understand very well now.
You're not bad at all.
Is that so!
Ahaha... You're so cute when you're
embarrassed.
   That's what you have to say for yourself
after yelling at me? Ahaha... you have
quite the silver tongue.
   What do you mean, you're going to torment
me!? Let's see you try!
  N-No way... What did I do...?
  I'm not surprised! Even if I didn't want
to, I could tell by how cocky you are!
Huh? Really? What ARE they teaching
them in schools today...?
  Thanks... that's nice of you!
  Don't get conceited!
   Why...? I'm just a weak demoness...
You're cocky, but honest, I'll admit.
  I told you nicely, too!
Ahaha... You're an honest one.
You know, now that I look at you,
you're pretty cute.
   Oh, is that so! With that huge face of
yours, I bet you could paint a picture
with all the blood you'll lose!
  Don't you know sarcasm when you hear it?
Humans really are stupid.
 What are you getting all solemn over?
You're so self-centered!
 Uh-oh... You're plotting something,
aren't you...?
 I'm so happy!
  Huh, you're actually pretty stingy.
Heehee, just joking! You're dancing,
right?
I know that! Don't you know you suck?
  What amazing stamina... You really do
seem like you're going to dance through
the night...
 What, you're going to stop? No, please
keep going!
 That's what you have to say for yourself
after taunting me? Ahaha... you have
quite the silver tongue.
 Oh, is that so!? Let's see you try!
N-No way... What did I do...?
  That's what I thought! That doesn't
actually mean anything. You're such
an idiot!
  That's what I thought! That doesn't
actually mean anything.
Huh? Really? What ARE they teaching
them in schools today...?
  Thanks... that's nice of you!
  Don't get conceited!
   Why...? I'm just a weak demoness...
Awww... I don't know what to say...!
   Heehee... Then why are you looking?
Ah, I'm such a sinful woman.
   What's with you, you little brat!?
 Ha! It's so obvious!
   What's up with that!? Then what do YOU
want from me!?
  You're cute! I'll play with you later...
Heeheehee.
Heehee... You're so embarrassed that
you're saying things you don't mean.
I can tell.
  Yikes... don't you have a sense of humor?
  What're you so embarrassed about?
  Awww, you're trying to act all modest.
I think it's cute when you do that.
 Even if that's true, you're not supposed
to say so yourself!
   Is that so? All right, then.
   Is that so? All right, then.
   I can't trust you!
 Ahaha... I understand very well now.
You're not bad at all.
Is that so!
Ahaha... You know you want me, but it's
cute that you're so embarrassed about it.
  I know, right? It makes me so angry.
   I know, right? I wish they'd do something
about it.
Hey! You think this has nothing to do
with you, huh!?
  Listen up! NEVER talk about anything
like that again!
  Sheesh, don't tell me any more stories
like that... I really don't like them.
  I said stop it!
Eep! Please stop!
  This is the story of a girl who foolishly
tried to negotiate with a demon...
She ruined the beautiful demoness' mood,
and it ended up eating her! The end!
That's so boring...
That's what you like, huh...?
  You're nice. I think we could be
good friends!
 You're going to keep it all for yourself,
aren't you? I hate greediness like that.
 Okay!
  Well, all right. I'll let you have it...
   No!
Well, bring it on! I'm not responsible
if you lose your voice!
 Hm, you seem pretty confident.
...Let's call it off for now!
   Hmhmhm, you must've gotten scared.
No surprise there!
  Awesome! That was totally amazing!
 What amazing pitch... Hey, are you
really human?
   What a voice you have... I really can't
believe you're actually a human.
   ...Was that sarcasm? You're such an
awful girl!
...I'm not surprised.
  Then you did it on purpose! If you
underestimate me, you'll regret it later!
   If you don't know, oh well...
  Looks like humans aren't as scary as
I always thought they'd be...
 Sheesh, and I was having such fun!
You're so dull!
 Oh, is that so?
I think it's cute when you do that.
Even if that's true, you're not supposed
to say so yourself!
   Is that so? All right, then.
   Is that so? All right, then.
   I can't trust you!
 Ahaha... I understand very well now.
You're not bad at all.
Is that so!
There's no need to hold back, you know.
Deep down, you know you want me...
 Huh... You're actually pretty obedient.
I told you nicely, too!
Then you did it on purpose! If you
underestimate me, you'll regret it later!
   If you don't know, oh well...
  Grrrrrr!
   I can't believe I'm letting this...
lowly human... console me.
 That "totally" is really annoying,
you know!
   Um... it'll just be dinner, okay...?
   Is a dinner outing not enough for you?
You're actually pretty greedy...
Will you hurry up and make up your mind!?
I'm losing my patience!
  Huh... I'm surprised at how smart you
really are.
  Huh... I'm surprised at how smart you
really are. Though it's kind of annoying.
It's too bad, though... Things would have
gone smoother if you were a demon.
   Oh, are you scared now? Well, considering
it's me you're dealing with, that's no
surprise.
 You're backing out now...? You're such
a coward!
   You may still be a child, but there's
something admirable about you.
I'm impressed.
Oh, is that so...
  Is it really "totally"? I have my doubts.
  Honestly, that silver tongue of yours...
You're a pretty bad girl.
 Oh, it was true? I'm sorry, I can't
always read human emotions.
You're still going to play dumb? There's
no way you're putting one over on me!
 I'm in a fix here...
   Thank goodness... I don't deal well with
people crying.
That's what you have to say for yourself
after threatening me? Ahaha... you have
quite the silver tongue.
  Oh, is that so!? Let's see you try!
N-No way... What did I do...?
  That's what I thought! The sentence
structure's all wrong. You're such
an idiot!
   Heehee... the sentence structure's
all wrong.
  Huh? Really? What ARE they teaching
them in schools today...?
  Thanks... that's actually nice of you!
 Don't get conceited, you little witch!
 Why...? I'm just a weak demoness...
What's with that attitude...? Who do you
think you are?
What's with that attitude!? If you
underestimate me, you'll regret it later!
   If you don't know, oh well...
  Could this also be a form of love...?
  How cruel... I thought we were friends...
  Y-You fiend! That's so cruel!
I'll never forgive you for that!
 Ahaha!
 How could you stop just when it was
getting good!? You're so cruel!
Ah, a new approach to bullying! But I
still like the traditional style more.
   Oh, is that so?
I think it's cute when you do that.
Even if that's true, you're not supposed
to say so yourself!
   Is that so? All right, then.
   Is that so? All right, then.
   I can't trust you!
 Ahaha... I understand very well now.
You're not bad at all.
If you can admonish others that way,
you're independent after all. Humans like
you interest me...
  Oh, is that so! You talk all big, but
your judgement stinks when it comes
to demons!
   What's with that attitude...? Who do you
think you are?
What's with that attitude!? If you
underestimate me, you'll regret it later!
   If you don't know, oh well...
  Could this also be a form of love...?
  How cruel... I thought we were friends...
  Y-You fiend! That's so cruel!
I'll never forgive you for that!
 Ahaha!
 How could you stop just when it was
getting good!? You're so cruel!
Ah, a new approach to bullying! But I
still like the traditional style more.
   Ugh, what is it? That really makes me
uncomfortable, you know!
 Hmph! If you're gonna ignore me, you can
ignore me to the end!
 Oh, you talked... You really don't have
much willpower, hm?
You know, enough's enough!
 It's bad!
  That's right, you just needed to say
something.
...Do you even want to negotiate?
  Thank goodness you talked...
   What do you mean, "What do you want"!?
We're in the middle of negotiating here!
Ugh, what is it? That really makes me
uncomfortable, you know!
 Hmph! If you're gonna ignore me, you can
ignore me to the end!

quite the silver tongue.
  Oh, is that so!? Let's see you try!
N-No way... What did I do...?
  What's with that attitude!? And to think,
I paid special attention to you!
 Heehee... You're a shy one!
What's with you...?
Thanks, that's nice of you!
Don't get conceited!
   N-No way...
What are you bragging about!? I can't
stand you anymore!
   I-I'm sorry...
 That's right, calm down.
   You're so disgusting...
You're so disgusting! What's wrong with
you!? Go away!
 You big silly, I was lying!
Don't you want me to like you!?
Huh...? You don't want me to like you?
 Yes, I'm surprised. I didn't know there
were human sorcerers!
  I know! Don't take it so seriously!
Huh? Then what is it...?
   You're right. I mean, you want to
negotiate, so you'd have no reason to
try anything funny.
Are you trying to threaten me...?
  "Heh," my ass! What's with that "heh"
of yours!?
   I knew it! I just knew it!
 I'm not going to do anything in
particular.
You tricked me! This is negotiation fraud!
 Hey... C'mon, you're joking, right?
You don't think that at all! Stop playing
with me!
 No way! Adventuring? In this day and age?
You're a rare bird!
  Huh... Well, you're honest.
Hey! You're supposed to be polite to
a lady!
   What did you say!? I think I've just
about had it!
 All right! Okay.
   Don't you have any sense of humor?
How sad for you...
  None! You're too sly!
  None.
  One's body is one's most precious
possession, after all!
   I see. Are you all right?
  D-Don't come near me, okay...?
 Huh... What should I do?
   Is that so!
What a weird human...
  You won't do anything painful, right...?
   Huh? Is that really true...?
   Huh? Me? Well, who knows?
  Hmmm... I feel like there's something
else at work here...
 Hmph! I hate you too!
  Is there an obstacle in the way of our
love? Ahaha... I've always wanted to
say that!
  Oh, I'm sorry... I'm okay now.
 Nooooo! I'm scaaared!
  A-Ahahaha...!
  Where's that confidence coming from?
Then again, it's better that than a man
who has no confidence at all.
 You think so too? You understand!
  Sheesh! You don't have to get so angry!
Hey! You got my hopes up!
  Oh, my! What should I do?
  A-A secret...? I've got a really bad
feeling about this...
