彻 Ԃ츛Ą츛ઢ츛ങ츛  蛳 ȿ̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺I don't get what you're saying mister,
but I like it.
  Hmm... You're actually pretty reliable,
mister.
  Don't make stuff up!
   Your story sounds like a big phony to me!
Is it for real?
You just wanna talk to me, don't you?
I know I'm cute and all...
   Hee hee! You're trying to persuade me...
In other words, you need me, right?
 You're confident, aren't ya mister?
But I bet you're all talk!
 You seem strong, mister! So, what are
your plans for me?
 ...I'm not gonna play with you!
You're a smooth talker, mister!
  What's so fun about surprising a
demon like me...?
 I'm scared...
I don't really get what you're saying,
mister, but I feel like I'm being
invited.
  I don't mind thinking about that...
but I hate people who promise to pay
up later!
Don't make stuff up!
   Your story sounds like a big phony to me!
Is it for real?
I'm kinda in a hurry right now...
Sorry...
 D-Don't tell me you're going to
kidnap me...?
You really wanna show off how good you
can sing, huh? You're a lousy human!
Don't act all cool over something like
that! I'm way better than you!
Y-You're better than me...
 Do they call you Donald or something!?
Seriously, just stop...
   You're not nearly as good as me, but I
think you have talent.
  You're pretty good...
I don't really get what you're saying,
miss, but I think I can help you.
   I don't mind thinking about that...
but I hate people who promise to pay
up later!
Don't make stuff up!
   Your story sounds like a big phony to me!
Is it for real?
You just wanna talk to me, don't you?
I know I'm cute and all...
   I don't mind thinking about that...
but I hate people who promise to pay
up later!
Helloooo! It's completely obvious that
you don't mean it!
  Don't you have any pride, miss? I hate
girls like you more than anything!
Gross! Your real intentions are so
obvious!
Hello... I've heard a lot of rumors
about you too, Maki-chan.
That's right! It's important to
recognize peoples' skills!
 I always knew I was too perfect! I even
scare myself... squee!
   I don't really get what you're sayin
miss, but maybe you're right.
 You're pretty easy to trick, lady.
But that makes you so innocent and cute.
Don't make stuff up!
   Your story sounds like a big phony to me!
Is it for real?
You just wanna talk to me, don't you?
I know I'm cute and all...
   Ahahaha! I can't believe a story like
that, miss! ...'Course, maybe if you
gave me something, it'd be different!
   You really get it!
 I thought you were just stupid, miss.
Sorry!
 Helloooo! It's completely obvious that
you don't mean it!
  Don't you have any pride, miss? I hate
girls like you more than anything!
Hee hee! Modesty is the way to go! Yep!
I always knew I was too perfect! I even
scare myself... squee!
   You're so weird! But you have style,
so I don't mind!
  I don't mind going out with your if it's
just for dinner... It'll be your treat,
right?
  Do I... look easy to pick up on?
That kind of sucks...
 Unless you're in a boy band, I'm not
interested, and you don't look like
you are! Like... at all!
I'm scared...
  I'm scared...
  No way, are you hitting on me?
Too bad you're like a two...
No way, are you hitting on me?
Hmm, what should I do...?
 Do you wanna play with me that much?
You're such a little boy, mister!
 Ahahaha! I hear entertainers are
really smart!
 What's up with that!?
  This is so boring! I don't even get what
the joke's supposed to be!
  Oh man, so lame...
 Huuuh!? No way! You're a weird guy.
  Ahahaha! My tummy hurts!
   Hmm... That sounded like the kind of
gossip you'd hear from a street punk!
But I liked it!
   Oh, so that's how it works... Being
human sounds tough too.
Don't you have any more interesting
stories?
 This isn't the time to be talking about
that stuff! Man, you're really killing
the mood!
   Can't you take this negotiation more
seriously!? This isn't the time for
small talk!
 Thanks for telling me a story! Ooh, I'll
tell you a great story I know later!
  Thanks for telling me a story! But what
I like most of all is badmouthing people!
You want me to play with you, mister?
You're such a little boy!
Wh-What was that just now!?
  Wh-What the!? Oh, you make me so
angry! Screw you!
 What's wrong with you!? Are you stupid
or something!?
Yikes! Seriously, what was that for?
You're like, sorta out there, mister.
 Are you okay, mister? It's dangerous
if you're gonna get that hyper...
Calm down a little, okay?
 You're giving me a present?
Really...
  Are you from a rich family? Then you can
give me more, right!?
   Hey! Don't underestimate me! I'm not
gonna be coaxed with cheap items!
 I don't want something boring like that!
Don't you have anything better?
 Yaaaay! I got a present!
   Hee hee! Make more offerings to me! More!
I don't really get what you're saying,
mister, but you might be right.
 Hmm... You're actually pretty reliable,
mister.
  Hey! Don't make up stuff!
  Your story sounds like a big phony to me!
Is it for real?
You just wanna talk to me, don't you?
I know I'm cute and all...
   Hee hee! You're making a big speech, but
what you mean is, you need me, right?
   You're confident, aren't ya miss?
But I bet you're all talk!
   If you say you're strong, mister, I guess
you are! So, what are your plans for me?
   ...Fine! See if I play with you anymore!
   You're a smooth talker, mister!
  What's so fun about surprising a
demon like me...?
 I'm scared...
Say what you want, but you've got one
nasty personality, mister...
 Hey, mister, is this your first time
talking to a girl?
  I'm actually older than you, you know!
Can't ya just act normal?
   You should brush up on your negotiation
skills... If you want to live a long
life, that is!
  Ahahaha! I get so embarrassed when you
praise me that much...
  Ahahaha! You're smart too, aren't you,
mister!?
  I'm pretty good at doing sexy dances.
...I'm not kidding!
  Wow, you're pretty good! Teach me too
next time!
 Man, you totally suck. Come back after
some practice!
  Yikes, what're you doing!? The bathroom
is that way! You're gonna embarrass
yourself if you don't hurry!
 That's so cool! I wanna join in!
   Yayyyyy! This is my first time seeing
a human dance!
 You're confident, aren't ya mister?
But I bet you're all talk!
 You seem strong, mister! So, what are
your plans for me?
 See if I play with you anymore!
You're a smooth talker, mister!
  What's so fun about surprising a
demon like me...?
 I'm scared...
Oh crap! Is there something on my
face?
What is it? Are 
ძ that rare?
Hmm? You got a problem or something?
   Stop staring at me!
  You're staring at me all dreamily!
Hee hee! It's 'cause I'm cute.
  Hmm? What's wrong? Never seen a demon
as cute as me?
 I don't really get what you're saying,
mister, but you might be right.
 You're pretty easy to trick, huh mister?
But that's what makes you so cute!
Hey! Don't make up stuff!
  Your story sounds like a big phony to me!
Is it for real?
You just wanna talk to me, don't you?
I know I'm cute and all...
   Ahahaha! I can't believe your story,
mister. Of course, it would be
different if you gave me something!
   You're such a kid for believing in
something like that!
So what are you hinting? That I'm like
one of those ghosts, too?
 Hey, s-stop it! I really don't like
stuff like that!
   Eek! Nooo! I'm not one of those demons
who likes stuff like that!
You know, my stories are much scarier
than that! You wanna hear one?
 I wanna go to a spooky place on a dare,
too! Do you know anywhere I could do
something like that?
Hmm, that was pretty good. You've got
talent, miss!
Let's do a duet next time! I'll do
Posh's part!
  You really wanna show off how good you
can sing, huh? You're a lousy human!
Don't act all cool over something like
that! I'm way better than you!
You're not nearly as good as me, but I
think you have talent.
  This feels so nice...
I wanna play too, okay? How ish it
going, Mommy?
   I'm not that young, you know...
Ahahaha...
   You're the worst! I'm gonna finish
you off...!
 What a rude human! You don't have any
manners at all!
For some reason, I'm feeling all
nostalgic...
  Yaayyyy! This is kinda fun!
  I don't really get what you're saying,
miss, but I feel like I'm being invited.
I don't mind thinking about that...
but I hate people who promise to pay
up later!
Don't make stuff up!
   Your story sounds like a big phony to me!
Is it for real?
You just wanna talk to me, don't you?
I know I'm cute and all...
   So in other words... you need my card?
   You can say whatever you want, but
you're a nasty person...
Hey, you better brush up on your
negotiation skills. You want to live
a long life, don't you!?
   You're the worst! I'm gonna finish
you off...!
 What a rude human! You don't have any
manners at all!
...Look who's talking, miss look-at-
my-bling-bling-that-brings-all-the
boys-to-the-yard...
Don't give me that bullshit,
you *bleep*ing little *bleep*...
Huh... So human girls don't care
what sex their mate is...
 I don't mind going out with your if it's
just to have some tea... It'll be your
treat, right?
I'm a girl! I only go with boys!
   Oh, is that so... then I'll play extra
nice with you, heheh!
 To tell you the truth, you're just my
type! I was waiting for you to come
talk to me...
*blush* I like you, Ayase...!
Stories like that really get to me...
*sniffle*
Cheer up! Not everything in life is bad!
 You think I'm gonna fall for a trick
like that? How stupid are you?
Will you just quit it!? I already know
those are fake tears!
 I-I didn't do anything! You just started
crying for no reason...
   Why'd you have to start crying...?
   You're confident, aren't ya ?
But I bet you're all talk!
   You seem strong, miss! So, what are
your plans for me?
   See if I play with you anymore!
You're a smooth talker, miss!
What's so fun about surprising a
demon like me...?
 I'm scared...
You're the worst! I'm gonna finish
you off...!
 You're so rude all of a sudden! You don't
have any manners at all!
   I'm sorry! Please stop, miss...
Why're you bullying me!?
I didn't do anything!
   Ahhh... I think I'm starting to like
it when you torment me!
   <Name> has been a bad girl...
Do that some more!
  I don't really get what you're sayin
miss, but maybe you're right.
 Hmm... You're actually pretty reliable,
miss.
Don't make stuff up!
   Your story sounds like a big phony to me!
Is it for real?
You just wanna talk to me, don't you?
I know I'm cute and all...
   You're only interested in me for my
card, aren't you?
Will you shut up!? Don't make me kill
you!
 You're so rude all of a sudden! You don't
have any manners at all!
   I'm sorry...! Please stop, miss!
   Why're you scolding me!?
I didn't do anything!
   You're real full of energy!
<Name> has been a bad girl...
Scold me more!
  Huh, you're pretty confident. I'll be
impressed if you can keep that up until
the end.
 Huh? Don't you have some business with
me, miss?
 You've got so much confidence, miss!
It's totally pissing me off!
  So you're gonna ignore me, huh? Hmph!
How dare you make fun of me like that!?
Did I do something...?
 Um... Didn't you need something from me?
 Huh, you're pretty confident. I'll be
impressed if you can keep that up until
the end.
 Huh? Don't you have some business with
me, mister?
   You've got so much confidence, mister!
It's totally pissing me off!
So you're gonna ignore me, huh? Hmph!
How dare you make fun of me like that!?
Did I do something...?
 Um... Didn't you need something from me?
 You're confident, aren't ya mister?
But I bet you're all talk!
 You seem strong, mister! So, what are
your plans for me?
 See if I play with you anymore!
You're a smooth talker, mister!
  What's so fun about surprising a
demon like me...?
 I'm scared...
Wh-What the!? Oh, you make me so
angry! Screw you!
 What was that for!? Are you stupid or
something!?
Yikes! Seriously, what was that for?
You're like, sorta out there, mister.
 Are you okay, mister? It's dangerous
if you're gonna get that hyper...
Calm down a little, okay?
 You're weird, mister! But you seem cool,
so I don't mind!
  You're crazy! I like dangerous
people!
   You'd go as far as pulling out magic
tricks to get me to play with you?
You're such a kid, mister!
 Wowwies! So you're a sorcerer!
   Huh? Humans can cast spells now?
   Don't try anything funny, like making
me disappear, okay...?
 Magic tricks, huh...?
You're so refined, mister!
   Hey, Mr. Handsome! Use your magic to
conjure me up some new clothes!
 Hmm... Human stories are interesting!
I love listening to them.
Why're you being so serious...? Huh...
Do you think I'm that charming?
 I don't mind listening to your story,
but you know, it'd be nice if my wallet
was heavier...
  That's the worst story I've ever heard!
So stupid!
 It's no use going on and on about stupid
stuff like that to me!
Your story's boring, you know! But if
you gave me something, maybe I'd be in
a good mood again...
 Y-Ya know, That glare you have when you
talk to me is scary...
 I don't care about stories like that...
Seriously, I just wanna go home...
 Hahaha! It's been a long time since
I heard such a fun story!
  The way you talk is so cute!
   This is so fun... I could keep chatting
like this forever...
   Hmm... You actually have a keen eye for
demons... I have some pretty high
expectations for you!
C'mon! Just negotiate, no frills!
  I totally understand what you want to
say! So you should listen to me, too!
Who do you think I am? I'm 
<Name> of the ძ!
I'm not lending my powers to a human!
  Are you stupid or something!? Why ask
for help from someone who doesn't deal
with slimy humans!?
   Aren't you a human!? Then we have nothing
more to talk about!
Though I might change my tune if you
coughed up a little...
That's what you say now, but you're gonna
trick me, huh? Humans are scary...
   I don't feel like listening to requests
from humans. I really want to just get
out of here...
  I hate humans... So stay away from me!
If you don't, I'll cry...
   Huh? You actually want me? Wow, this is
so great!
  Does that mean you want me? Ooh, keep
saying stuff like that!
  Hahaha! My charms drive humans mad, too.
   Aren't you doing that on purpose? Well,
I get it, already, so hurry up and get
to the point.
   I'm kind of interested in people who
aren't quite normal...
If you want to get to know me, there's a
better way to do it than with those tired
negotiation skills!
Did you just make fun of me? I hope you
have a will prepared!
  I see no reason to hold back when I have
to deal with annoying humans like you!
I'm so incredibly annoyed! I won't forgive
you unless you give me something!
  You're so cruel, taunting a cute
demon like me...
  What's wrong with you? Stop making fun
of me... *sniff*
I'm just a cute girl...*sniff* *sniff*
 I love a thrilling negotiation!
You annoy me, but you're just a kid,
so I'll forgive you!
  Ahahaha! You're just jealous because
I'm cute, huh?
Well, all right, I'll play with you!
Just give me something first!
   Oh, are you an entertainer? Well,
good luck to you!
Sorry, but not quite! You weren't bad,
though, so please try again sometime!
   Hmm... that wasn't so great, so I'll give
you some advice! But you'll have to pay
up first!
   Boooooriiiing...!
  Bleeeeah! Go home already!
 You expect to make some cash with
something like that? Forget it! I'm the
one who'll be taking money from you!
Wh-What in the world...? I don't get
it at all...
  Was that a ritual or something...?
Are you some kinda cultist...?
  Hahaha! Man, you're funny. I could
watch you all day!
  I wish I could do some kind of trick,
too... Maybe I should take up a hobby.
   *whistle* Show me more!
So you want me? Maybe I'll let myself
fall for it! Hehehe!
 Haha! I'm actually much older than
I look. Are you okay with that?
 Hmm... I'll think about it, sure...
But you gotta show some generosity!
   Are you making fun of me?
  I can't betray my friends for that!
Do I LOOK that stupid to you?
  One yell from me and loads of my friends
will show up. You wouldn't want that to
happen, right?
If not, then give me something!
  Uh-oh! I-I was wrong...
Uh-oh! I-I was wrong...
Uh-oh! I-I was wrong...
Oh no... I think I'm falling for it...
 That's a pretty old trick for seducing
people! But that makes it an antique...
So it might be a good thing!
Hahahaha...
Huh... Do you do stuff like that because
you're so weak?
   Tooooo bad! I can see right through
your schemes!
  Maybe in 100 years you'll be worthy
to look at my feet.
Ugh, you're annoying the crap out of me!
Will you stop it!?
If you want to be my slave, do as I say!
  Something seems kinda off...
You're suspicious...
  Are you scheming something? If you are,
just come out and tell me...
   Hahaha! Maybe I should make you my
bodyguard!
  If you don't say, "forgive me, mistress,"
I'll shred you to pieces!
My name seems to be famous in the human
world, too! Hee hee... That's so great!
Huh? You already have my card! You better
take good care of it, okay!?
 Then I'll give you this!
   Huh? Is that so?
   Sorry, it seems like our tastes are
too different.
 Aren't you a little too cocky for how
weak you are? I'm not giving you my card!
Then I'll give you this.
   Well, bye-bye!
 Here's something extra on top!
 I'm gonna get going now!
   I'll curse you if you fuse me with
some weirdo demon!
  I'll give you this... so please, spare
my life!
Ugh, I've had enough! I'm leaving!
 I'll give you this if you go home like
a good human.
   Sheesh! Humans have made me so angry
lately! Honestly... I feel like a total
idiot for negotiating with you!
   I just don't even care anymore! You want
my spell card? Fine! It's yours!
  Um... I... I want to be useful...
  Here's my spell card... Feel free to make
it into whatever Persona you want!
   I can't fight you...
   This is from me...
 But you're human, so you have at least
a little mercy in you... Right...?
  Oh! I know! I'll give you my spell card!
So please? Please?
Hey, are you doing anything fun now?
 *sniff* *sniff* Hmm, I can smell demons
on you.
Hmm... This is my first encounter with
a human. Give me something to remember
it by!
  What's with that face!? If you've got a
problem, then spit it out!
   I'm in a bad mood today. If you don't get
out of my sight, you'll be sorry!
You obviously have a present for me,
right? Hurry up and give it!
 From this point on is my territory,
got it...?
   I can't stop shivering... Your face is
just that scary.
There's no moon out. That's why I'm scared
and I don't think I can sleep tonight...
Show me some tenderness, mister...
   It's such a nice day today!
  Hey, do you prefer well-behaved girls?
Hahahaha!
   A full moon! Hahahaha!
 I got a full schedule, so if you don't
need anything, I'm gonna go.
 I'm busy! If you have something to say,
make it quick!
I'm busy, but if you're gonna give me
something, I'll hear you out!
  Um... if you don't really have any
business with me, I wanna go home.
   Do you have real business with Mistress
<Name> of the ძ?
I don't want any trouble, okay?
   You make one funny move, and I'm outta
here, lickety split!
Do you believe in destiny? I feel like
I've waited a long time for this day...
  Do you believe in destiny? I think our
meeting is pretty good proof!
  Eep! I feel like your gaze is sucking
me in!
  Um, do you happen to be a წ?
No! No! Stay away from me, you
*bleeeeeep*!
   I warn you... i-if you kill me,
you'll regret it...!
  Hey! Don't tell me you think you and me
are on equal grounds here.
  Humans again...? I'm tired of dealing
with all of you! I wanna go home!
Hey, human! C'mon, where's your gift for
your queen?
 A human... thank goodness! I'll do
anything, just please spare my life!
 I'm all hyper for some reason right
now... I'm all yours!
 I don't think I can resist any more...
I want you to make me your pussycat!
   So what're you trying to say?
  Don't get carried away, lowly human!
   Am I... going to be defeated by a human?
That would be terrible...!
Hee hee! Humans aren't scary like I
thought they'd be!
 Ugh! Stop wasting my time! If you want to
say something, say it!
   ......
I'll listen to your request. But no
cruel stuff, okay?
  I'm in a good mood today. I'll listen
to whatever you say!
 It's too early for me to depart from
this world! There's still so much I want
to do!
   I think I've had enough! I'm tired of
negotiating with you. I'm gonna go look
for some other humans.
   ......
Whether I live or die is all up to you,
isn't it...?
You know what I want? <Amount> yen.
   Hehe, thanks!
  You're terrible! If you don't have money,
you might as well be dead!
   I'm not at all interested in poor people.
  Are you trying to negotiate with me
without paying the price? Isn't that
a little selfish!?
What's with you? You don't even want to
negotiate with me, do you? Ugh, what a
waste of time.
  Gimme one of those things that starts with
"l" and ends with "e"!
  I'm so happy!
  So you were negotiating with me and you
didn't have any life stones? Ohhh, you
make me so mad!
 You don't even have any life stones?
Ugh, how lame...
  Oh, is that so...? Then why don't you
take it with you to hell!?
   You're human and you're that reluctant
to give up your life stones? You're kind
of like a demon that way.
  I want a , darling!
   Lucky me! Just what I wanted...
Nooo! I've been had! And I made a point
only to deal with rich people!
 I've had it! I'm killing you for sure!
 ...You can't possibly be my darling,
so I guess I'll let this one slide!
   I'm hungry... just let me have a little
sip. It won't hurt!
I'll be extra gentle!
  Grrr! I only wanted a little.
You're so stingy!
Oh, is that so...? I guess I'll let it
go this time!
   That's nothing to brag about!
  Huh, that's cool of you!
   I can't believe it!
Wait, I can't tell which it is when you
say it like that. What did you mean...?
Hahaha! Don't dodge the question!
Seriously, which is it?
  That's what I thought!
 Ahahaha! I know that deep down,
you totally want it!
   Why're you holding back? I know that
deep down, you really want it!
For reals?
 Oh, is that so!? Then why don't we test
it out?
Ahahaha! You wanna duke it out so we
can see which one's stronger?
 Hmph, don't you understand sarcasm?
Hmmmmm, really? I wonder if I seem like
a cocky demon to others...
 You think so? But I'm still no match
for you, mister.
  Hmm, you're pretty gullible. Hehe...
   You're such an idiot! You'll fall
for anything!
No way! That's more interesting than
scary!
I can't believe it!
Ahaha! I think we can get along
pretty good!
   Huuuuuh? I feel like I'm the heroine
on some show!
 Huuuuuh!? W-Wait a second... I'm not
mentally prepared yet...
  Whew, I'm glad to hear that!
   What's up with that!? You're just a kid
yourself!
  Ahaha! So you're finally falling for
my charms!
You told me it would be amazing, but I
didn't think it would be THIS good!
Thanks for the tip!
 Oh my god, I thought I was going to
die... They told me it was insane,
but I had no idea...
It's so bad it could kill me!
Seriously, stop it!
  You were awesome, mister! That was really
cool...!
 You still have enough air in you...?
Hey mister, are you really human?
 Hmm, I'm surprised you still have enough
air in you... It's like you're not
even human!
I can't believe it!
Wait, I can't tell which it is when you
say it like that. What did you mean...?
Ahahaha! Don't dodge the question!
Seriously, which is it?
 Oh, is that so? You do, huh...?
Oh, is that so? You do, huh...?
Then why don't you use a different
negotiation tactic!?
What's with this human!? Don't
underestimate me!
   That means if I defeat you, I'll be the
next talk of the town!
 Ugh, you're taking it seriously...?
You're soooo stupid!
   Hmm... You know, you're kind of cute,
Maki!
I know you don't want to admit there are
demons out there better than you, but that
attitude has got to go!
I know you don't want to admit there are
demons out there better than you, but it's
just destiny.
  Really? Hey, what should I do?
Should I become an idol?
I can't believe it!
Wait, I can't tell which it is when you
say it like that. What did you mean...?
Ahahaha! Don't dodge the question!
Seriously, which is it?
 Don't get all mad...
   There's no need to be so embarrassed!
You're so cute, miss!
There's no need to get all embarrassed
over something like this!
   Oh, is that so? You do, huh...?
Oh, is that so? You do, huh...?
Then why don't you use a different
negotiation tactic!?
What's with this human!? Don't
underestimate me!
   I know you don't want to admit there are
demons out there better than you, but that
attitude has got to go!
I know you don't want to admit there are
demons out there better than you, but it's
just destiny.
  Really? Hey, what should I do?
Should I become an idol?
Just so you don't get the wrong idea,
let me be clear: I'm only going out to
dinner! That's it!
Ooooh, are you embarrassed? You're so
cute, mister!
No way! The way you said that sounded
just like it! Well, a little!
Sorry, but come back when you've taken
care of that acne problem... *giggle*
   That's right! You're outta the picture!
Never mind! I'm not that easy, you know!
   I really shouldn't go with a guy
this easily...
What should I do...? Maybe it'd be best
if I went with you...
  Oh, so that's what you mean! Yes, I get
it now!
ENOUGH IS ENOUGH!
  Hey! Don't come over here!
 But... your eyes say otherwise...
  What're you so angry about!? You need to
take criticism better!
Honestly, will you grow up? There's no use
getting mad about criticism.
Hmm... If that made you laugh, you might
have some promise.
Then tell me later, okay!?
 Is that so... Whoever bullies me has
to swim the Sumida River!
 Why're you bullying me...?
 Hey! I just told you to be more serious!
   You know, you should at least listen to
what I have to say!
If you're not going to listen to what
I say, then screw you!
   Tee hee! You think so?
 Huh... so that's how you are. I think
I misunderstood you, mister.
 Well, SORRY!
   Well, SORRY!
   What's with you!? Quit putting on airs!
It really doesn't help even if you
explain it...
   Ahahaha! That's what I thought!
I knew it... I try not to go near
dangerous humans...
  Hmph!
  That's right, calm down.
   You're so gross! What's wrong with you!?
Get away from me!
 You're gross...
Men are so easy to manipulate...
You're naive, too.
Ahahaha! Men are so easy to manipulate.
Whaaat? Don't you have any money...?
Stingy people are useless! I don't have
any more use for you!
 I'm sorry...
   Yay! Thanks, mister!
   You're not gonna give it to me?
Fine, then! Go away!
   I'm so happy!
  That's nothing to brag about!
  Huh, that's cool of you!
   I can't believe it!
Wait, I can't tell which it is when you
say it like that. What did you mean...?
Ahaha! Don't dodge the question!
Seriously, which is it?
   That's what I thought!
 Ahahaha! I know that deep down,
you totally want it!
   Why're you holding back? I know that
deep down, you really want it!
For reals?
 Oh, is that so!? Then why don't we test
it out?
Ahahaha! You wanna duke it out so we
can see which one's stronger?
 Hmph, don't you understand sarcasm?
Hmmmmm, really? I wonder if I seem like
a cocky demon to others...
 You think so? But I'm still no match
for you, mister.
  You're so naive that it's easy to trick
you, mister... Hehe...
 You're such an idiot! You'll fall
for anything!
No way! That's more interesting than
scary!
Awww, you're cute after all!
   Awww, don't make me kill you!
  I'm gonna kill you!
You better be careful from now on!
 What did you say? It's none of my
business? Dude, like, get your butt
over here right now!
 No, seriously!
 That's not true!
   Why're you so excited? Oh, I get it...
You were hoping for something more, huh?
Haha, you're such a perv, mister!
  Oh, is that so!? Fine, then!
   I'm sorry I messed with you! I knew it
was really a dance...
   You don't even know sarcasm when you
hear it... That's so stupid!
  Wooooow! That's so cool!
   Wait a sec, that was cool! Huh...
Humans aren't as bad as I thought.
   So boooooring!
 For reals?
 Oh, is that so!? Then why don't we test
it out?
Ahahaha! You wanna duke it out so we
can see which one's stronger?
 Hmph, don't you understand sarcasm?
Hmmmmm, really? I wonder if I seem like
a cocky demon to others...
 You think so? But I'm still no match
for you, mister.
  Hmm, you're pretty gullible, mister!
   You're such an idiot! You'll fall
for anything!
No way! That's more interesting than
scary!
You know, I think it's because everyone's
gotten beat up by you, mister...
 You know, I think it's because everyone's
gotten beat up by you, mister!
   Then why are you staring at me so much?
Oh, could it be...? Hee hee, I'm popular!
  Oh, so I'm right? But is it okay for you
to call over a demoness?
  Screw that, you bastard! I'll stab you!
But you're totally not my type! You make
me feel all dirty... Stop looking!
Ahahaha! You're embarrassed, so you're
saying stuff you don't mean.
I understand...
*sigh* Won't you play along even just
a little?
I can't believe it!
Wait, I can't tell which it is when you
say it like that. What did you mean...?
Ahahaha! Don't dodge the question!
Seriously, which is it?
 Well, I am a demon, so that's how I'd
prefer people to think of me.
Something seems suspicious, but...
 What do you mean, "no"? You can be
such a jerk!
Honestly... Don't talk about stuff
like that!
  Phew... Don't talk about stuff like
that anymore, okay?
Nooo! I don't wanna hear about that
kinda stuff...
 Huh... So you like scary stories...
But you better be careful not to let
yourself get too into them!
   So you were just bluffing! Ahahaha!
 You like that kind of thing, miss?
Looks like we might get along real good!
   You like that kind of thing, miss?
 Cheapskate!
I gotta practice my moves. This is no
time to be playing around.
   Then I should practice my moves too!
   I can't?
   What're you acting all high and mighty
for!? You're just a kid yourself!
   Ahahaha! I know... Of course, I'm much
better than you!
You were awesome, miss! That was really
cool...!
   Talk about high pitch... Hey... Are
you really human, miss?
You can reach such high ranges...
It's like you're not even human!
 Wroooooong!
That's right. I'm an adult!
Well, I guess that's fine.
 Umm... I don't wanna die...
Hmph! I'm not scared at all!
   I'm totally surprised! Humans aren't
scary at all!
 Awww... so boring!
 I can't believe it!
Wait, I can't tell which it is when you
say it like that. What did you mean...?
Hee hee! Don't dodge the question!
Seriously, which is it?
 That's what I thought!
 Ahahaha! I know that deep down,
you totally want it!
   Why're you holding back? I know that
deep down, you really want it!
You better be careful from now on!
 What did you say? It's none of my
business? Dude, like, get your butt
over here right now!
 Well, I guess that's fine.
 Umm... I don't think I wanna die...
Hmph! I'm not scared at all!
   Hmph! In your face!
Y-You make me so mad!
  Okay, okay. We'll just go Dutch on it!
Man, human women are so stern...
Huh? So you're not going? You're so
scatterbrained, Ayase!
 Boy, Ayase, you sure are naive, huh...?
You won't get anywhere if you're scared
all the time!
  You won't get anywhere if you're scared
all the time!
  If you die, I'll make sure to eat you,
Miss!
   Sheesh, you're annoying! What are you
so scared for!?
  Huh? What're you scared about all of
a sudden...?
  But noble people like you only make me
want to bully them!
 But noble people like you make me want
to bully them even more!
If you don't mind, I'll lend you my help!
  There's a few tricks to fake crying.
I'll teach you some later.
Ahahaha! WHATEVER!
 Sheesh! You so don't mean that!
I don't know what to do...
 Thank goodness...
  For reals?
 Oh, is that so!? Then why don't we test
it out?
Ahahaha! You wanna duke it out so we
can see which one's stronger?
 Hmph, don't you understand sarcasm?
Hmmmmm, really? I wonder if I seem like

   Oh, so you like that sort of thing!
Okay then, miss!
   You're a fiend!
You're a fiend...
  Oh, I'm so happy!
  Why'd you stop!?
   That kind of mean stuff is... Hmmm,
it's not bad either...
 This isn't something to get all
embarrassed about!
 Huh, that's cool of you!
   I can't believe it!
Wait, I can't tell which it is when you
say it like that. What did you mean...?
Ahahaha! Don't dodge the question!

 You're such a nasty human!
 C'mon, don't tease me like that!
   Are you shy, miss? Hmmm?
   Grrr! You better stop underestimating me!
  What is it? You want something from me,
right...?
  What's with you!? If you don't want
anything with me, get out of my sight!
 Ohhh... If you wanted to negotiate,
you should've said so from the start.
  You're such a nasty human!
 C'mon, don't tease me like that!
   Are you shy, Miss? Are ya?
 Grrr! You better stop underestimating me!

  Don't you want me to like you!?
Huh? Don't you want me to like you?
Yeah! That really surprised me!
Huuuuuh?! Then what is it...?
  Huuuuh!? Then what is it? I'm really
curious now!
  Are you threatning me!?
B-But if you did something like that,
I'd never hear the end of it from my
friends...
  Really? Then I want a skirt, shoes,
and a bag! I'll take overnight shipping,
please.
   I was lying when I said it was cool!
Cheapskate! You're nowhere near cool!
 Oh crap... R-Really?
   Sheesh, you're good!
   Wh-What the? Teach me!
 Shut up!
   What's with you? I won't understand
unless you speak up!
   I won't understand unless you speak up.
I won't lose even if you threaten me!
  Okay!
  Territory is territory!
But... territory is territory...
   Nope! You get none!
Man, it seems like it's gonna be
cold this year.
   Hmm... Well, it's a greeting after
all...
  The weather's important, you know!
The moon affects how I feel, too.
   What do you want with me? I bet it's
gonna be some stupid negotiation!
 Then I'm not going back home!
  Awwwww... you're so cute!
  What if this is a crime...?
Oh, really?
Huh? Me?
   You think so too, mister?
  That's not it? I see...
I understand...
You want me to jump in there? Ahahaha!
 ...No way! I won't fall for it!

   No way! I totally smell demon blood
on you!
I heard წ slaughters any demon
he meets... That's a lie, right?
They mean someone else, right?
 I envy your self-confidence...
 Of course!
 Ahahaha! If you get angry, your blood
pressure's gonna rise!
