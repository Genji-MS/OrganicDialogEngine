Then I have a favor to ask of you...
I'd like you to lend this human power.
▶Archangel
I must refuse, Master.

This troubles me, human. You refuse the
power of my successor?
▶Michael
Archangel, I apologize...
▶Archangel
...No need, high one! It is the
blindness of human eyes...
▶Archangel
I must return to my duties, Master.
Lead your flock to paradise.
   ▶Michael
Very well.

Archangel! I again leave the spread of
His word to you.
▶Archangel
As you wish, Master...

this human your card.
   ▶Angel
As you wish, high one...
Human, here is my card.

Angel... It is my order that you give
this human your card.

Though it pains me, I must refuse,
o high one.

I'll be on my way now!

humanity's sake!
