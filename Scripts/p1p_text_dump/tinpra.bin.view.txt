彻 ḷ Ԃ ⋁ ઢ   蛳 Ἓ̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺Tryin' to persuade me ain't gonna do ya
any good, y'know! You're a weird dude...
   Dude... don't ask me stuff like you 'n
me are best buddies! I might be small
time, but don't go underestimatin' me!
Ya got some real damn guts. I like it.
Ya ain't scared o' me, neither.
 You wanna step, man? Eh, I'll let it go.
At least ya ain't no prancin' prick.
  Ya want some!? 'Cause I'll give ya
more'n ya can handle! Better quit if
ya know what's good for ya!
Guess I went soft, if even the humans
are underestimatin' me...
Ya invitin' me in? Eh... I got enough
work of my own. But I might change my
mind if you gimme somethin'.
  We got our own code, and negotiatin'
with humans for no damn reason ain't
part of it!
  I'll pass on that one... I doubt ya'd
do better than a half-ass job...
 Man, ya suck so bad my ears are gonna
go on strike! Stop singin' already!
  I can't believe ANYONE can sing that
bad... Ya got a throat problem?
   Wow, ya sing just like Jones!
Kick ass, man.
   I wanna give you a hand, but ehhh...
Gimme somethin' first.
   Don't underestimate me just 'cause I'm
small-time! This ain't charity hour!
I can see why ya'd wanna rely on me.
It's great you're bein' so honest.
It ain't that fun gettin' praise from
ya, y'know!? It just pisses me off!
  Ya don't gotta be so modest, y'know...
It gives me the creeps, kinda.
  Hey, a girl that understands me!
Now that makes my day!
You're an interestin' kid. Who knows,
maybe the crap you're sayin' is true.
No more of your bullshit! I ain't so
thick I'm gonna fall for that crap!
   Ya lie so bad. If ya wanna fool a hood
like me, ya gotta give it your all!
 Relax, willya? I'm a nice hood. I ain't
gonna attack or nothin'.
   Whaddaya talkin' to me for!? I ain't
interested in no ordinary humans!
 Whaddaya talkin' about? Don't worry,
me and my guys are all gentlemen.
 Seriously, man? Get yourself checked out
at the doc's... If there ain't nothin'
wrong with ya, I'll think about it.
The hell are ya talkin' about!? A hood
like me can't go around havin' tea with
no regular joes!
Dude... Hurry up and go see a doc...
   Man, that joke is wearin' out its
welcome. Ya better quit while I'm
still laughin'.
You're pretty frickin' funny, ya know
that? Ya could be the next Diceman.
Let's hear your nursery rhymes.
  Ya tell another shitty joke, and I'm
gonna cut ya down! Ya got talent,
all right... talent for pissin' me off!
 No SAD Dummy.
  You're pretty funny. I like that kinda
joke, an' screw anyone who don't.
   Ya wanna talk? Then cut the chit-chat.
 Don't waste my time with that crap!
Man, you're a real chatterbox! Alright,
sure, I'm game if ya wanna talk!
   What the hell was that!? Ya gave me a
hell of a scare... Warn me next time,
all right?
 Go around surprisin' people if ya want,
but don't pull that crap on me!
Man, ain't ya scared of me...? Ya ain't
all there upstairs, are ya...?
 Ahhh, I get it... A rich boy, ain't ya?
That makes us pals.
Ya think ya can pay me off just 'cause
I'm a hood!? Think again, asshole!
  Well hell, if you're offerin', I'll
take it. Today's my lucky day!
 That was one eloquent damn speech!
I bet ya'd make a hell of a politician!
 Quit usin' all those fancy words and
be quiet for a while.
 Is this for real!? Ain't ya kinda young
to be sayin' crap like that?
   You got cojones, man. I bet you 'n me'd
make a hell of a team!
 You wanna scrap? I ain't holdin' back,
so you best be ready!
   The hell are you...? We ain't got nothin'
to do with you, man...
   Ya seem like you're on a roll! I wonder
if it's about time I took a younger
brother under my wing.
 Cut the bullshit! You ain't old enough
to make a fool outta me!
Hell yeah! I'm workin' hard and
aimin' high!
   Man, lookit you work them hips! You're
better 'n Crazy Legs! I love watchin'
that breakdancin' stuff.
  Boy, do you ever suck ass... Stop that
right now!
  You ain't bad... But you better get more
practice if you wanna be like Crazy Legs!
 You wanna step, man? Eh, I'll let it go.
At least ya ain't no prancin' prick.
  The hell're ya talkin' about!? Better
shut it if ya know what's good for ya!
   Guess I went soft, if even the humans
are underestimatin' me...
You got guts, bro... It's been a while
since a man's looked me straight in
the eye!
Hey, you just glare at me!? Alright,
now I'm pissed!
   Man, be a little more modest.
It's creepy, starin' at guys like that.
  Are you a frickin' moron? I ain't ever
heard such a pile of crapola!
   No more of your bullshit! I ain't so
thick I'm gonna fall for some
kid's braggin'!
 A cocky guy, huh? Well, if ya wanna fool
a hood like me, ya gotta give it your all!
A story like that ain't gonna freak us
out! Is that what you think of us hoods!?
   Me an' horror stories don't get along,
so... I didn't like it...
   Man, girls sure do love that kinda story!
Ah, hell, they're cute... They can do
whatever they want.
Hey, that ain't bad! Ya coulda made it
big if ya'd been a singer!
  Man, that ain't gonna cut it! Even Alanis
sang her jagged heart out better'n that!
 You got a great voice! Not only that,
but that's a great song! Man, I'm on top
o' the world now!
   Ya seein' things? No matter which way
ya cut it, I ain't a little kid...
   Cut the bullshit! If you were my mom,
how old would that make ya!?
 Hah! I didn't see that one comin', lady!
Well, I guess life's more fun when it
throws ya a curveball now and then!
 Ya invitin' me in? Eh... I got enough
work of my own. But I might change my
mind if you gimme somethin'.
  We got our own code, and negotiatin'
with humans for no damn reason ain't
part of it!
  Ain't ya sorta invitin' me in a tricky
way? I know what you're up to!
  You're a hell of a girl. You an' me would
make a great couple!
 You talkin' shit about me!? I don't
take that, not even from girls, so I
hope you're prepared!
 What's with you? Ya got a grudge or
somethin'?
 You're bad news all over... My heart's
poundin' 'cause of you!
 A little girl like you shouldn't go
around seducin' men!
   Now that's what I like to hear!
Whaddaya cryin' for? Cheer up, it ain't
the end of the world.
  If ya think I'm gonna help ya for free,
think again! It's gonna cost ya!
  You've been through some rough shit,
huh? Must be hard being human...
  What, you're tryin' to scare me with
that? Ya gotta put some effort into it!
   Whaddaya talkin' about!? You're pissin'
me off... I got half a mind to shut you
up once and for all!
   You're a real handful... Even a yakuza
floozy wouldn't go that far.
Whaddaya talkin' about? This ain't a
joke, and I ain't laughin'!
   You're a holy terror... Those awful eyes
o' yours... *shudder*
 You're one spirited gal. I like girls
like you!
You're one smart cookie! I'm pretty
interested in that kinda stuff...
  Do you ever shut up? I didn't come here
to listen to girls talk!
   Man, don't make me laugh! You're way too
young to go around sayin' that stuff.
 The hell're ya talkin' about!?
You're one uppity bitch! I'll make
ya eat those words!
  I know I been a bad boy... Just don't
yell at me anymore...
You got guts, for a woman... You'll be
a great mom someday!
Hey, didn't ya want to talk to me about
somethin'? I'm' dyin' to know what
it was!
 Ain't you the one who started this?
Screw it, you deserve a smackin'!
  Ouch... A girl's givin' me the cold
shoulder... I really blew it...
Hey, didn't ya want to talk to me about
somethin'? I'm' dyin' to know what
it was!
 Ain't you the one who started this?
I've had enough of this shit!
  A lone wolf, eh...? Well, that's fine.
 That supposed to be some kinda threat?
Be a man! Put some oomph into it!
   Whaddaya talkin' about!? You're pissin'
me off... I got half a mind to shut you
up once and for all!
   Holy crap, man... I-I'm gonna pass
for now...
  Whaddaya talkin' about!? It's pissin' me
off, so you better shut the hell up!
  Guess I went soft, if even the humans
are underestimatin' me...
Look, I don't mind if ya yell, but do
it where there ain't no one around,
or else ya might get arrested someday.
   Man, that's rich! Wanna be partners?
We'll hit it big in showbiz!
  Magic tricks, of all things? Ain't ya
a little old for that...?
Man, it's a real waste usin' your brain
on that crap! You gotta take better care
of your noggin than that.
 You're pretty damn smart. I bet you know
just what to say to hoods like me.
   Ya tryin' to negotiate with me? Let me
show ya how it's done. First, hand over
your valuables.
Ya know what a guy like me loves most?
Silence. Think about it, willya?
Man, we can't talk without no
preconditions, man! Ya gotta hand
somethin' over first.
 What's an honest guy want with me?
I got a meeting I gotta get to...
   If you're talkin' to me, I know you
ain't THAT honest. So let's see what
ya got for me.
   That jaw of yours never stops flappin',
does it? Think of me when ya finish
law school.
You're pretty calm. As a li'l token of
my goodwill, I ain't gonna ask too much
from ya.
   Ya got some real guts there. Ain't too
many people who could pull off a
negotiation like that.
 I think I got a good idea of what you're
thinkin'. I'll let you give me somethin'.
Ya don't think too much, do ya? Ya gotta
use your brain when ya negotiate.
 Geez Louise, ya never shut up. Noise
pollution's a crime, ya know. Now c'mon,
let's get real here!
What's an honest guy want with me?
I got a meeting I gotta get to...
   If you're talkin' to me, I know you
ain't THAT honest. So let's see what
ya got for me.
   That jaw of yours never stops flappin',
does it? Think of me when ya finish
law school.
You're pretty calm. As a li'l token of
my goodwill, I ain't gonna ask too much
from ya.
   Ya got a hell of a strong will not to
get pissed or scared around me.
I like it!
   You're pretty bold if you ain't scared
or mad at me. Let's see how bold ya can
be, hmmm?
  Ya makin' fun o' me? Humans die real
easy, ya know!
Ya wanna see Hell? Then before I send
ya off, ya better take everything ya
got with ya.
   What's an honest guy want with me?
I got a meeting I gotta get to...
   Ain't ya scared that I'm mad at ya?
Kids these days...
 A man's gotta rein his anger in. That
blusterin' crap don't work on me.
I bet you're tryin' to piss me off, but
it ain't gonna work. You're gonna have
to cough up, okay?
 Man, you go all out. Keep it up!
   You're a hell of a clown, pullin' that
stuff while you're talkin' to me.
Let's see what else ya got.
  Cut the bullshit! Us hoods ain't so laid-
back that we'll just watch that crap
without a word!
 Man, don't even try. You're just wastin'
your time. Hand over your stuff and let's
get this over with.
You're all screwed up. I don't even know
where to start...
 ...I don't get how normal people think
nowadays. Explain it to me usin' real
simple words.
C'mon, don't make me laugh. I never knew
it'd be this tough to hold back a smile!
  You're pretty talented, and I like your
style. I'm lookin' forward to seein'
what you do next.
 Anyone who wants me on their team is
great in some way. You're gonna make
it big someday, kid, I can tell.
 You invitin' me in? Then you gotta pay up.
You underestimatin' me? I ain't sure I
like folks like you takin' me lightly.
  You callin' me greedy!? Talk about bein'
underappreciated!
 ...I ain't interested in no regular folks.
 ...I ain't interested in no regular folks.
But you gimme somethin' and I might just
change my tune.
   Alright, first off, a man can't be greedy
in this world. It keeps ya from bein'
swayed by that kinda deal.
 Don't go doin' stuff that pisses me off.
Like bribin' me... I hate that.
  What're you all scared for? We wouldn't
do nothin' to a regular gal like you.
  Don't worry about nothin'. I'm a nice
guy, long as I get what I want.
 Women who don't try to do nothin' but
please their man are so narrow minded!
They ain't worth trustin'!
If ya really wanna make me happy,
ya know what to do.
 I bet ya got somethin' up your sleeve...
Ya can't trust "honest" folks after all.
  Judgin' from experience, I'd say your
attitude's pretty fishy...
   No need to worry. It's a big world,
but there ain't too many good-ass guys
like me who're nice to women.
   Guys like me that lived their whole life
underground understand. Don't worry.
  Alright, so you got my card. Now hurry
up and make me into one hell of a kickass
Persona!
  Here, ya can have this.
A hood is a hood... If ya ain't from
the underground, ya won't understand...
   Ya ain't like me, are ya?
  It's too bad, but... ya ain't got enough
experience. I'm gonna keep my card
for now.
   Here, ya can have this. Use it when
you're trainin'.
   See ya 'round.
 Ya don't need any o' that false modesty
around me.
 Willya hurry and decide!? Are we done
here or not!?
This card proves we're pals! Make sure
you make one hell of a kickass Persona
outta me!
Here, take this... Arguin' over nothin'
ain't gonna do either of us any good.
  A normal guy like you should stay home
and play games. I'm gonna get goin'.
A normal guy like you should stay home
and play games. Here, take this and buy
yourself a new one.
 I'm gonna take this knife and--What the!?
The blade's chipped... Aw, hell, that was
my favorite knife!
 I got nothin' to lose! Take my spell-card
and get outta here!
  ...I ain't like ya. Guys like me, we
don't know no other way but to live
underground...
So yeah, it's true that sometimes I
wished I could've gone straight...
I'll leave that dream I gave up with you.
Here's my spell card... Good luck with it.
   I ain't got nothin' to gain from arguin'
with folks like you...
It was fate, us meetin' like this. Here,
this is for you... Who knows? Maybe next
time, we'll be enemies...
It's true, our place was raided not too
long ago. The boss is in bad shape, too...
 Let's be adults here. I don't think
you'll be disappointed if you get to
have my spell card...
 What's a regular human doin' out on a
moonless night? Better answer quick.
   Man, talk about carelessness... Ya better
watch yourself on moonless nights. Got my
warnin' fee?
  What're ya hangin' around me for!?
I'll crush you kids like bugs!
What, you ain't even gonna say hi?
Rude guys like you gotta pay for havin'
no manners!
Whaddaya want...? Kids should stay home
and sleep...
 What ARE you...? Eh, I'll let you give
me somethin' if ya hurry on home.
  Hey, take a look at that! Ain't every
day you get to see a beautiful full
moon like that.
Willya take a look at that? That's one
hell of a moon! Why don't ya gimme
somethin' to remember it by?
Ya got guts, answerin' my call when
you're nothin' special. but ya can go to
hell if you're gonna act all arrogant!
 Hey, you're in my way. Better pay the
trespassing fee!
   What's a regular joe doin' out on a
moonless night? Gimme a straight answer.
If you're interested in the yakuza,
I'm sure ya know already... Ya gotta
pay up.
 I'm a hoodlum, ya know. But it ain't bad
to talk to honest folks once in a while.
   Man, ya look like you're rollin' in dough!
C'mon, share the wealth a little.
 Ya ain't scared of me? If ya don't
shape up, someday ya'll get stabbed in
the back...
   Hey, you're supposed to greet your
superiors first. Let's see a little
show of faith, huh?
   ...What's a regular guy like you doin'
answerin' my call!? You wanna walk on
the wild side a little?
You? You came when I called? That's a
laugh. I'll let ya go this time...
long as you pay the fee.
Dude, I been lookin' all over for ya!
I'll be countin' on you to take care
of the Tendou family for us.
 Ya got a lotta nerve, talkin' to a
junior yakuza type like me that way.
Gimme whatever ya got.
   I like the hell outta you! Y'know what,
I'm gonna make ya one of the family.
Tell me what you want, and it's yours.
You underestimatin' me!? I ain't gonna
calm down again till I see some blood
on the ground!
What's with you? Ain't you scared of
hoodlums...? If you met my boss...
Hahahaha! This's the greatest!
Hahahahahaha!
   I don't quite feel like you're takin' me
seriously here, but I'll let it slide.
So tell me what ya want.
   It's a huge relief knowin' I ain't gonna
have to fight ya. Anyways, tell me what
it is ya want.
You're like a role model for hoods!
I'll design your tattoo myself! So come
on, tell me what ya want.
  If that's true... man, your tricks
are just like the ones us pros use!
 You ain't quite got what it takes to
hold up your end of a conversation.
Don't underestimate me, kid.
  ...Ya got guts. I ain't never heard any
regular joe talk about that stuff...
   Maybe ya could gimme a little loan.
<Amount> yen oughtta do it.
   Kids seem pretty well-off nowadays!
Thanks, I appreciate it.
   Ya think I ain't serious!? It's just
common sense to flash a little cash
durin' a negotiation!
 The hell'd ya spend all your money on?
If you're not smart with your dough when
you're young, ya'll regret it later.
   Ya think I ain't serious!? If ya don't
hand it over like a good kid, ya'll
regret it later for sure.
   Ya don't know much about hoods, do ya?
Well, this oughtta teach ya whether ya
like 'em or not.
 Gimme a life stone. One'll do.
 Regular joes like you don't need that
stuff anyway. I'll hang onto it for ya.
  You underestimatin' me!? It's just common
sense to have some life stones when
ya wanna negotiate!
  Dude, at least carry a life stone or
two with ya. They're important when
ya wanna talk with us.

   You underestimatin' me!? Hand 'em over
like a good kid, or ya'll sleep with
the fishes.
What's a regular guy like you gonna use
life stones for anyways?
   Hey, hand over a gem. Like a
 or somethin'.
   You ain't entirely on the up an' up.
It's your type that succeeds, though.
 Hey, ya ain't even got any.
You underestimatin' me!? Hand it over
like a good kid, or someone'll find
ya stuffed in a trunk someday.
   What, is a gem so important you can't
part with even one? That greed'll be
the death of you someday...
 Lemme take a sip of your vital energy.
It won't hurt, I promise.
   I like regular folks' vital energy.
It ain't tainted or nothin'.
   You underestimatin' me!? What, ya think
it'd be tainted if a guy like me took
a little sip? Is that it!?
   Wait, ya ain't feelin' well? I dunno
about this all of a sudden...
Wait, ya diseased or somethin'? I dunno
about this all of a sudden...
   Too many guys out there borrow money and
never pay it back. Must be tough for ya.
  That's a pretty cheap trick, but it's
important to start at the bottom. Keep
an eye on the future and ya'll go far.
Go to hell!
...Ya don't get what's goin' on here,
do ya? You ain't doped up on anythin',
are ya?
   Then I'll give ya exactly what ya want...
A nice full-body cast!
   Ya sure are calm. I don't mind forgivin'
a man that's got guts.
I'll play favorites with good kids, kids
quick on the uptake.
  Ya really do underestimate me, ya know...
  Then I'll send ya to the big sleep!
Is that all ya got to say? Ya gotta put
some wit into it.
  Man, you're a strange one! I'm gonna
straighten ya out!
Ya got one warped mind, kid... There's no
way ya'll grow up normal...
  What a coward... Ya gotta work on that.
If ya think ya said somethin' cool,
think again, 'cause I'M that oni!
  Well said! I'll back anyone with as
much guts as you!
  *sigh* Sure, you're just a kid, but
you're doin' one lousy job... Money
talks, and don't forget it.
What're ya stakin' out? A hood like me?
Now ain't the time...
  Ya look pretty comfy, havin' a stroll
while I work my ass off. Maybe I'll rip
ya apart to blow off some steam!
 Hahahaha! Ya'll go far, kid.
   Wasn't expectin' to find a real man here.
Ya got what it takes to be a yakuza!
 That kinda attitude, I don't forgive!
Talk fast, cause it might be your
last chance!
   If you're that scared, ya shouldn'tve
answered in the first place!
 You really are underestimatin' me...
   It ain't smart to bluff. You wanna know
that bad how it feels to be knifed!?
   What the hell nonsense is this? Don't go
underestimatin' us, kid!
  Hell yeah! The underworld is a rough
place on your average joe.
What the hell're ya sayin'!? If ya keep
underestimatin' everythin', you won't
survive even with nine lives!
Hey, ya said somethin'... Which means ya
ain't the real Ryu! Ya wanna get a taste
of hell, do ya!?
 Hahaha! Man, you're right... I had ya
confused for someone else!
   I thought ya were dead... Is this some
kinda joke...?
  I thought ya were dead... Is this some
kinda joke...?
