彻 Ԃ츛ઢ츛ങ츛ച츛  蛳 㤏̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺What are ya expectin' from an old man
like me? You're an odd one.
  I'm glad ya think so, but I'm past my
prime... I can't help you.
 Argh, whaddaya want from an old man!?
Look at a demon before ya open yer trap.
 Hey! If yer tryin' to make friends with
demons, ya better be upfront with 'em!
   Ho ho! Ya want my card ya say? Hmmm?
 Ho ho! No matter how old ya get, it's
nice to be counted on!
   Heh... The closer ya come to yer death
bed, the easier it gets to forgive.
The mistakes of youth don't bother me.
  Ho ho! I'm like a stone wall. You
couldn't break me if ya tried!
 Argh! It don't take much to rough up
you high-spirited youths! Ya got no
backbone!
   I got my pride too! My back may be
givin' out, but I accept your challenge!
I'm old... All I want is to live out
the rest of my days like a hermit...
  Y-You wouldn't... You wouldn't torment a
defenseless old man, would ya?
  Ho ho! Never thought I'd be gettin'
called out at this age!
You're sure into strange things... What
good you think an old man like me can
do for ya?
 I just want to live in peace! Please,
leave me be!
 Argh! I may be old, but I'm still a
ჹ! I'm free to pick my work!
 I know yer just tryin' to sweet talk
yer way into my good favor...
 You'd be takin' a loss if you hired an
old man like me... You're up to no
good...
Argh! This is terrible! There's a limit
to bein' tone-deaf, boy!
   I hate this song... It brings back bad
memories...
   What is that voice...? Maybe that's
why I've got this headache...
  What a terrible voice... How do ya
stay sane listenin' to yourself talk?
 Ho, ho! That a song about havin' a
false sense of courage? How delightful.
 That there's a good song. Your tone has
a way of makin' a listener happy!
There're tons of other demons more
worthy of listenin' to a talented one
like you...
I don't know why you'd be chirpin' at
an old fool like me...
 They say the healthiest trees provide
the best shelter, don't they? What're
ya doin' here with me then, eh, Missy?
   You still plannin' on crackin' the whip
on this dyin' old body!? What a cruel
little girl you are!
   You're relyin' too much on others...
Young'uns nowadays are so lazy! They
don't know what hardship means!
  Heh... So there's even a yen's worth
to this old man?
Shucks, I'm happy! I just can't refuse
the siren call of a sweet young lady.
   Flattery don't give me any warm
fuzzies... Just makes me angry!
Hm... You're... quite a looker, you
are...
   Human girl... Whaddaya think you're
gonna get outta bein' on my good side?
   You're waggin' your tail now... But
sometimes a dog bites the hand that
feeds it...
Ho, ho! You're lettin' me drain your
life, so I might as well. Otherwise I'd
be wastin' yer offer.
   Ho ho! What a charming young lady we
have here!
Ho ho! You tryin' to pull one over on
me? You've got too much time on your
hands, Missy.
 Heh! I must say, I tip my hat to the
imagination you humans have.
  Everything you're sayin' is a baseless
lie! Nothin' worse than youngsters
lyin' through their teeth!
   Sounds like you've got some ulterior
motives... How much fun could it be to
prank a geezer like me, Missy?
   Now ya've done it. That goes far and
beyond a normal pack of lies, heh!
Ho ho! I'm right as rain if I've got
some candy to suck on.
  Look at that face! It's like you've
lost... Hrmm... What was it?
 Heh! You've got a lot to learn if you're
goin' pale in front of an ol' geezer!
 I ain't gonna eat ya! Stop starin' at
me like a deer in headlights!
  Argh! I don't eat the likes of you!
There's nothin' to be scared of... I'm
just a harmless old man! Heh heh heh!
   Ho ho! Sounds like I've still got some
dignity left in me, eh?
   You must have some real troubles if
you're interested in old folks... Heh...
   Ho ho ho... You may be young, but doin'
it with just anyone ain't healthy.
   Now listen here! Stop that! You're
makin' me sick! Quit ooglin' me!
Ain't ya got no manners!? Young'uns
these days think everything's a joke!
Here, here, boy. I ain't interested in
men. I don't know what I'm gonna do with
you fawnin' all over me...
 ...I'm a man, and an old one at that.
You need your eyes checked, son?
   Ho ho ho ho.
  Ho, ho! I'm havin' trouble holdin' back
my laughter. You're pleasant for a
human.
  Ho ho! You're an interesting one!
You some kinda comedian actor?
 It's so dry... I'd rather be basking
in the sun!
   What's with that act? It's downright
colorless! Do something about it!
   Ho ho... My stomach's all unsettled...
 Whoa, I almost dislocated my jaw there.
How frightful...
   Heh! You're a fun fella. That's a life
worth livin'.
   Ho ho ho... I can't stop laughin'.
You stop it for me!
   I'm always up for a good chat. Say...
Do ya wanna talk about me?
 It's gotta be hard findin' a subject
worth talkin' about with an old man.
What a considerate child you are.
Argh! So nonchalant! You just gonna sit
in lukewarm water yer whole life!?
   You just take life as it comes, don't
ya!? You need to train yer guts out,
or death'll come knockin'!
  Heh... I got this tendancy to get all
worked up... Small talk is downright
relaxin'.
   Ho ho ho! You're a kitten that just
opened its eyes. You don't know anythin'
'bout this world.
   Heh! Not good enough, child... Get
older, and things'll stop surprising
you.
 Ho ho! You're quite young, aren't ya?
Good, I happen to like children.
 Argh! It'll be a cold day in hell before
ya carve out my liver, fellas!
Argh! You ain't comin' anywhere near
the hairs on my ass!
Don't bully us geriatrics... How am I
supposed to stand up to ya if I can
hardly stand?
Well I'll be! Wh-What're ya gonna do
about my liver...?
  Youngsters these days have all sorts of
useful gadgets... I'm green with envy.
 Those're all things an old man's pocket
change couldn't buy... Don't ya got
anythin' a tad cheaper?
  You may as well be givin' me a solar
powered lantern! Don't ya got anythin'
useful?
  I've gotten picky in my old age! This
wouldn't even make for garnish!
  Ho ho! The pie in the sky became real
food!
  Heh! This'll be useful. I'm grateful.
  Ho, ho, young people sure love talkin'.
Well, they say it's best to leave life
to the young at heart.
  You've got fire in your speech... Glad
you've got passion, but be careful ya
don't get burned.
   It's always the bad speakers who babble
on and on! I'm sick of this!
   You talk too much! I've been around much
longer than you, ya hear!
   Ho, ho! I see you're burnin' up, young
man. Like oil paper by a flame!
 Ho, ho! You were born talkin'
instead of cryin', weren't ya?
 Never imagined bein' yelled at by a
greenhorn like you. How much greener is
the grass over there, anyway?
Heh... Lookin' at you reminds me of my
younger days.
You're more conceited than I ever was,
but I'll let that slide.
  You ain't gotta yell! I'm right here!
And my hearin's just fine, ya know!
  Look how you're treatin' your elders!
If ya don't got manners, you won't get
anywhere in life!
   Hey, child... Is it that much fun to
yell at your elders?
You're supposed to treat your elders
kindly, yet here you are... My heart
nearly jumped outta my chest...
  Heh! It's obvious, boy! You're tryin'
to test me, ain't ya?
  It's regrettable, but I've gotten more
and more shameless over the years.
That won't phase me.
 Hey! I can see right through to your
true motives!
 Sarcasm, eh!? You've got a mean spirit,
human! I'll knock some sense into ya!
Ho, ho! You agree, don't ya? I may be
old, but I'm still a ჹ.
  Heh! I'm gettin' on in years. Say
whatever ya darn well please.
  What a goofy dance. It don't look
anythin' like the moves that were all
the rage when I was groovin'.
  Ah, you know how to twist those hips!
Just be careful ya don't strain yer
back too much.
 Stop jigglin' around! Ya look like a
darned, childish fool! It's annoying!
 Argh! You ain't even got a handle on
the basics! I'll teach ya!
  So you kids still know what real dancin'
is, eh? I'm impressed.
Ho, ho! Back in my day, I had quite
the jump n' jive! Danced all the time!
   Heh... The closer ya come to yer death
bed, the easier it gets to forgive.
The mistakes of youth don't bother me.
  Ho ho! I'm like a stone wall. You
couldn't break me if ya tried!
 Argh! It don't take much to rough up
you high-spirited youths! Ya got no
backbone!
   I got my pride too! My back may be
givin' out, but I accept your challenge!
I'm old... All I want is to live out
the rest of my days like a hermit...
  Y-You wouldn't... You wouldn't torment a
defenseless old man, would ya?
  Heh... You tryin' to count my wrinkles
or somethin'?
 You got passion in that gaze, son!
...'Course, I'd like it better if ya were
a lady...
 Now stop that! Yer makin' me downright
uncomfortable!
How rude! Ya shouldn't stare right into
someone's eyes like that!
  For such a young mind, you've got some
good concentration! Color me impressed!
 Ho, ho! What are ya expectin' to find
from inspectin' an old man like me?
Ho, ho! You tryin' to pull one over on
me? You got too much time on your hands!
I'd heard you humans were two-faced, but
I never imagined this. How many faces
you got, anyway?
  Everything you're sayin' is a baseless
lie! Nothin' worse than youngsters
lyin' through their teeth!
 Argh! Your story's got more holes than
swiss cheese! I won't fall for that
malarky!
Now ya've done it. That goes far and
beyond a normal pack of lies, heh!
  Ho, ho! This is like watchin' the great
comedians of yesteryear! I'm satisfied!
Hey! What would ya have done if my
heart went and stopped cold!?
 Argh! Did ya think that would give me
the willies? Whatchya need is drama!
 That story was downright eerie. Why do
human girls like those kinda stories?
 Boy, that story really curdles my blood.
...The world's a scary place.
 Heh! When ya get this old, there ain't
nothin' left to scare ya.
 You enjoy those kinds of stories? Still
a child, I see. Ho ho ho...
Ho, ho, you've got great posture for a
singer. Prettier than a picture.
You're sittin' pretty in that mediocre
range now, but someday you'll rival
the nightingale's song.
   Argh! This is terrible! There's a limit
to bein' tone-deaf!
I hate this song... It brings back bad
memories...
   Oooh! That there's a beautiful voice!
You take good care of it, y'hear?
That there's a good song. Your tone has
a way of makin' a listener happy!
Hmm? I'm well past my prime, Missy.
You need seein' lenses?
  Ho ho ho, you should be sayin' stuff
like that to yer children.
Hey, I still got my wits about me! Don't
treat me like a toddler!
  Argh! Poke fun at me, will ya!? Girl or
not, I won't hold back!
  Ho, ho, sounds like I still got it if
you're mistakin' me for a youngster.
 You're like an angel, Missy. You keep
that heart of yours pure now, y'hear?
  Ho ho! Never thought I'd be gettin'
called out at this age!
You're sure into strange things... What
good you think an old man like me can
do for ya?
 I just want to live in peace! Please,
leave me be!
 Argh! I may be old, but I'm still a
ჹ! I'm free to pick my work!
 Heh! It's good to be a ჹ!
I'm still popular, even at this age!
 You'd be takin' a loss if you hired an
old man like me... You're up to no
good...
I'm just an old man waitin' for death
to point his bony finger and take me.
You get kicks outta criticizin' me?
  Ho, ho! It'll take more than a few
ugly words to get under my skin.
Argh! Now I'm mad! You reckon you got
bite to back up that bark, kid!?
   What a rude li'l lady! Looks like it's
time to put ya over my knee!
I'm bein' made fun of by a girl? *sigh*
Oh how the mighty have fallen...
 Now what'd I do to deserve this? You
young'uns are a frightful bunch...
Hmm... Ain't that a pity. If young women
like you knew how to take care of their
skin better, I mighta fallen for ya.
Heh... Sometimes it's good to just enjoy
life with the young'uns.
  Hey! Women oughta be more virtuous!
  Argh! You're just a little girl! You
ain't supposed to be flirtin' like that
'til you're older!
At my age, there ain't much use
expressing those kinds of feelings, if
ya catch my drift! Ho ho ho!
Ho ho! Well, they do say love transcends
age, don't they? Guess it's true!
   The wheel of fortune gives most everyone
their chance. You just gotta be patient.
  Hey now, you'll get your slice of the
pie someday. No sense cryin' about it.
 Argh! You've come of age, haven't ya?
Stop clingin' to yer elders! You need
to be independent!
   I don't wanna hear it! Whinin' about
things won't change anything!
 The human world is full of hardship...
Don't lose hope...
  The human world seems like a tough
place... I don't wanna eat cold meals
at this age...
  Ho ho ho. Sorry, Missy, but you ain't
got the face for makin' threats.
   Ho ho! For such a sweet face, you sure
say some scary things.
  Argh! You tryin' to put the pressure on
me!? You're a little uppity for my
tastes!
 Argh! I've got my pride to consider!
I won't lose to a young'un like you!
Wh-What...? I'm just an old man who's
about outta fuel...
  ...I didn't do nothin' wrong, did I?
 Hey! Don't take that arrogant tone with
me, young lady!
Argh! Nothin' worse than punk kids like
you!
 You some kinda sadist? ...Now that I
think about it, you do have the look...
 ...I'm just an old fart. Now quit
pesterin' me.
Ho ho! With an attitude like that, ain't
no boy in his right mind gonna marry
you!
   Ho, ho! You've got spunk, don't ya!?
This'll be fun.
   Ho ho ho... You're never too old to
learn from someone else's mistakes.
Heh, despite how ya look, you've got a
level head on those shoulders.
  I've been around a hundred times longer
than you! Of course I know that!
   Argh! Stop worrying about this old
demon and start worrying about yourself!
  Ho, ho! Seems like the master is
learning from the pupil now!
Not everything is black and white.
You've got a lot to learn.
  Hey! Why do I have to eat the
leftovers!?
Hey! Just 'cause you're in a bad mood
doesn't mean ya should take it out on
us demons!
 I don't remember doin' anything that
called for a scornin'...
  Wh-What, all of a sudden you... Boy,
human girls are all kinds of scary.
   Ho, ho! You're drillin' for oil, but
this old man's all dried up.
  Ho, ho! Makes me feel like we're in
school or somethin'.
 You, with the short hair... Chat with
this old man for just a bit, Missy.
  Ho ho ho, you think you're ignoring me,
but you've got me in your thoughts,
I reckon!
Argh! So I ain't even worth lookin' at!?
Fine!
 Hey! Do I look like a rat or somethin'!?
Pay some attention to me!
   So ya got no business with this old
geezer, eh? I'm gettin' thrown away like
yesterday's trash...
Can't even look at an old man like me,
can ya? 'Suppose I'm doomed to fade
away without a single to notice...
  Ho, ho! The man of virtue never courts
danger, eh? But see here now, lemme
tell ya somethin' 'bout virtue...
 You're just too shy to talk, ain't ya?
Hohoho...
   Argh! So I ain't even worth lookin' at!?
Fine!
 Hey! Do I look like a rat or somethin'!?
Pay some attention to me!
   So ya got no business with this old
geezer, eh? I'm gettin' thrown away like
yesterday's trash...
Can't even look at an old man like me,
can ya? 'Suppose I'm doomed to fade
away without a single to notice...
  Hohoho, how do ya expect to hold a
sword over yer head if you can hardly
pick one up?
You've got a nice menace in that voice
of yours. If that's yer natural voice,
treasure it, y'hear?
 Argh! You tryin' to put the pressure on
me!? You're a little uppity for my
tastes!
 Argh! I've got my pride to consider!
I won't lose to a young'un like you!
Wh-What...? I'm just an old man who's
about outta fuel...
  ...I didn't do nothin' wrong, did I?
 Shut up! What a snotty young man!
  Hey! You're tryin' to play me for a
fool because I'm old!
Wh-What the...? Ain't ya got the will
to negotiate with me?
  Good heavens... It's dangerous to stick
your nose into the affairs of demons...
Ho, ho! It's great to see you so full
of spirit. I'm feelin' younger just
watchin' ya!
 Ho, ho! That yell had some oomph to it!
But what did it mean?
Hohoho, nice technique. Where'd ya learn
to do that?
 Now ain't that mysterious? ...I'd like
to know how ya did that.
You use such mysterious magic... I ain't
so good at dealin' with your type...
  Wh-What the!? You're tryin' to shake me
down...
  Hohoho! Thanks for takin' the time to
entertain an old man.
  You're an excellent magician! You should
come down to my retirement home, they'd
love ya there!
Hohoho, I see, I see. Human stories
can be useful.
 Humans enjoy talking about things like
that? Hrmm... I learned somethin' new.
  You've got a big mouth, so you've got a
big wallet too, right? I hope You can
spare your elder some change.
   Argh! Hush up! I ain't interested in
that!
 What!? I'm retiring soon! Just leave me
be!
You talk too much! Old people get tired
just listenin', ya know!
Argh! I'm chargin' you a listenin' fee!
 Your negotiation technique is givin'
away your plans...
...You're givin' off a real suspicious
smell here...
   Hohoho! You say such interesting things!
You're quite the talker.
  It don't matter what subject we're on,
I love talkin' to young'uns.
You're willing to deal with an old
geezer like me? How nice.
   Hohoho, never thought an old geezer
like me could still be of some use.
Well now, if you're invitin' me along,
I must still be in my prime!
Ho, ho! I can't give ya my power with
negotiation techniques like that...
Now maybe if ya surprised me, it'd be
another story. It just so happens
there's somethin' I'm hankerin' for...
 Argh! I don't like this negotiation one
bit!
In fact, I hate it! So gimme somethin'!
 What!? I'm retiring soon! Just leave me
be!
What's that!? If you want my power, hand
over the goods!
  I'm an old man... Just a geezer, really.
I don't want anythin' too dangerous...
I got a bad feeling 'bout ya in my
knees... This old man won't be much use
to you anyway...
It ain't a good thing when a human asks
for a favor...
 Ho, ho! My warrior blood is boiling!
   You said it! Even if yer lyin', I'm
happy as a pickle in vinegar.
  You want me to lend ya some power? I'm
sure ya do, but hold your horses...
 Hoho, just goes to show how young ya are
if you're usin' techniques like that.
 You think you're controlling the
negotiation like that? If so, you've
got a lot to learn.
  Ho, ho. Such nice weather...
Really, it's so nice out.
Give me somethin'.
   What's with you!? You think I'm senile,
don't ya!?
Argh! What an annoying brat!
   Hmph! ჹ don't pale at
negotiations like that!
Get too conceited, and even I'll get
angry!
 Well, if yer gonna take up that attitude,
I have an idea! Gimme somethin'!
...I'm an old man... An old fogey...
   Kids these days are frightful... Just
what do you think of the elderly?
If all the children out there were like
you, it'd be a scary world indeed... Oh,
heaven forbid...
  Heh! What's with that attitude!?
Oh well. When ya get to be my age, you
learn to roll with the punches.
   Ho, ho! I see you're still in that
rebellious stage. Hurry and grow up,
would ya?
  I ain't got much time left. I figure
it's best to not get upset and just
enjoy the winter of my life.
I know! Maybe I'll have you help me
out.
   Ho, ho! You need to work on your timing
a little, but that'll pass for an act.
 Ho ho! You a comedian?
It's a tough world out there for
jokesters, but don't lose heart, boy.
 I acknowledge that as a real class act!
So gimme my approval fee! Heh!
Well, that was different! Lousy, but
different!
And here I was lookin' forward to a
comedy show!
  Argh! This just ain't right! Stop!
 Argh! I don't like this negotiation one
bit!
In fact, I hate it! So gimme somethin'!
 Nice weather we're havin'... I didn't
see anything, so just lemme be...
Meddle not in the affairs of crazy
people... Boy, too scary...
 Ho ho ho! That's a humdinger! Hohoho.
  This negotiation technique's called
"entertainment," right? Do it some more!
   That was nice! Thanks for showing that
to me! Hohoho!
  Well, my motto's always been not to let
opportunity pass me by. I'm ready to go.
   I gotta hand it to ya, your negotiation
technique is fascinating... But what're
yer plans for this old man?
Ho, ho! You plan on seducing a man of
my experience? That just won't do.
  I'm a ჹ warrior! If I fell to
human temptation, I couldn't look my
compatriots in the face again!
  I ain't got no interest in tasteless
crap like that! Go talk to some other
demon!
  Argh! There's a right way to do
everything! Do ya get that?
   An invitation? Hmm... Can't say I'm
interested, but lately, ya don't know
what they'll do if ya turn 'em down...
   Now hold on a minute... I've got this
bad feelin'... Like I'm walkin' right
into your trap...
  ...I... I got some urgent business that
needs attendin'. Maybe next time.
  Do you need me that much? Hohoho!
I'm happy to know that!
  I ain't worthy of techniques like that.
But I'm happy ya used it...
Hohoho! What a grand feeling! I'm
climbing up the stairway of life!
You ain't much for lucky, are ya, Missy?
Well, I'm in a good mood, so you got
nothin' to worry about.
  Ho, ho! You're a fine young lady. You
know how to respect your elders.
 Argh! Women who try to lead men on are
deplorable! Deplorable, I say!
  Quiet, you! Little girls should be off
playin' house or somethin'!
 If you understand how dreadful I am,
then gimme somethin' and be on yer way!
  I'm havin' trouble believin' that was
really from yer heart...
 ...You seem rather humble, but I smell
somethin'...
You said it! Even if yer lyin', I'm
happy as a pickle in vinegar.
  Hohoho! I really am good, ain't I?
 Heh! You've got the art of survival
down pat, kiddo! I won't make any sudden
moves, so don't worry.
What? You already got my spell card,
don'tcha? Take care of it, y'hear?
I'll give this to ya.
  What's that? So in the end, you didn't
have business with an old man anyway.
   I'm a different breed altogether.
  Well ain't that a zinger? You don't got
what it takes. Keep on training.
   Well, ain't nothin' you can do about it.
I'll give you this instead.
   It's about time we went our separate
ways. It's sad, but such is fate. Take
care o' yourselves now.
Here's some allowance, youngster. Don't
spend it all in one place.
 I'm tired... Mind if I skidaddle?
  My back may not be in the best shape,
but I'm still active.
My spell card's kinda old, but you
better not put it in storage.
  Urgh... I'm gettin' pains... I better
get home. G-G-Goodbye...
 Aw, knock it off! Humans are much more
boring than I coulda thought! I'm
hittin' the road!
 Aw, knock it off! Humans are much more
boring than I coulda thought!
If I give ya this, I can go, right!?
 Hrrnng... I'm feelin' dizzy... You're
a real whippersnapper, raisin' my blood
pressure like that!
  But, I guess it's okay. Even meetings
by chance are meetings of fate.
...Take my card.
 You may be able to forge a new
path...
 So, take my spell card.
...I don't want to hafta fight you.
It ain't an easy world to get by in for
you humans. I'm worried about ya, so
take this with you...
 Argh! M-My back...! I'm done for...
I ain't gonna defy ya. I'll give ya
my spell card if ya just lemme go...
   Ho, ho! Quite a surprise to find humans
in a place like this.
But what are ya doin' here without the
moonlight as your guide?
   If this shows up, it's a bug.
  Ho ho ho, didn't expect to find anyone
out walkin' with me here...
It's lonely without a moon, ain't it?
I'll keep ya company, but how 'bout
somethin' to make it worth my while?
Hey! This path is private! Ya'll are
trespassing if ya ain't got permission!
Hm... And yer human, too! Ugh, this is
deplorable!
 Hey! This is my walkin' path! I don't
need no humans trashin' it!
  Hey! This is my strollin' path! You
need my permission to be here!
Ya wanna pass, then pay the toll!
 Without the moon... us old folks can't
see the ground so well. Makes it hard
to take evening strolls...
...Why does the moon disappear?
 If this shows up, it's a bug.
  I ain't anybody suspicious... just
an old geezer... Please don't hurt me...
It's best to watch the moon with some
snacks in hand! Just when I figured that
out, you showed up!
You must be heaven sent... so you've
got some for me, right?
ჺ Well, wouldya look at that! The moon's
lookin' mighty fine tonight!
It's such an inspiration. Feels good
to be alive at times like these.
 Ho, ho! An unsuspecting human's been
caught in my net!
Welcome to the darkness of the
netherworld! If ya want out, give me
somethin'!
Eh? A human? Please, no boring stories!
Hm...
But if ya manage to impress me, maybe
you'll get my card.
ჽThis is peculiar... It ain't like me to
talk to humans, but...
What? I thought I'd found company, but
it was just some wayward humans!
I'll negotiate with ya, but ya better
make it worth my while with sometin'!
 I'm reachin' out to ya because I've got
a question... Gimme yer best answer.
What do you think of moonless nights
like tonight, human?
౿ If this shows up, it's a bug.
  Why are ya meanderin' around in my
territory? I don't get it.
 Oooh! You here to keep me company?
Perfect!
Luck is with me today! Why don't ya
tell me a story? Make it interesting!
ℤ  Ooh! Ooh! You mind keepin' me company
for a bit? Sorry to trouble you.
I don't have much to offer at my age,
but I'll negotiate with ya on faith.
Heh, you've got a nice face for a human.
Maybe you'll be a saint someday! Hohoho!
Hey! Ain't ya got manners!? The first
greeting comes from the younger or the
inferior!
Wh-Whatchya starin' at? Cat got yer
tongue?
Ḭ If this shows up, it's a bug.
  ...! So it WAS a human! So that's why
I felt queasy! Now I'm havin' mixed
emotions, no thanks to you!
 Hee hee! Another victim ensnared by the
moon's charms!
You're already fish in a bucket. If
you've got last words, I'll hear 'em.
๏   Take a gander at the moon! It's such
a beautiful night!
It really makes the spirit flow over,
even in an old fogey like me!
  Hee hee! Another victim ensnared by the
moon's charms!
I'm feelin' generous tonight. I'll take
somethin' other than yer life.
   ...Eh? I thought you were an old
acquaintance. ...Who goes there?
⌎   If this shows up, it's a bug.
  ...Eh? I thought you were an old
acquaintance. Seems I'm mistaken.
I don't know you from Adam... Hohoho...
   Ooh! A life of servitude is a life
well lived. You got any wishes?
 Argh! I'm blowin' my top! You ready to
put up your dukes!?
 Yeargh! It's a demon! Ya know what they
say, he who runs fights another day!
   Hohoho! Not every day ya laugh this
much!
  Still! This is a pain! Let's pick up
the pace on this negotiation!
Come on, don't just stand there all
slack-jawed! Hurry up and state yer
business!
  Still! Why you usin' techniques like
that on me...?
No matter how old I get, I don't
understand humans any better. Whaddaya
want from me?
 Ho, ho! That was hospitality at its
finest! You're as sincere as they come!
Alright, to show my gratitude, I'll
return the favor!
 What the...!? Why's an old-timer like
me gotta go through with this!?
  Your negotiation style's a bit immature!
Try it again later.
   Hmmm... Maybe if I went with you, I'd
have a peaceful life. Perhaps it's time
to give over...
  Well... Hmm... What should I ask for...?
I guess I'll take my share of the money.
ჾ<Amount>.
 Ho, ho! You make it seem like money
really does grow on trees!
 Empty pockets, eh?! You're hopeless...
But I guess ya can't give what ya
ain't got...
  Hey! You're comin' up short! Lyin' never
pays!
 What a waste... Yer supposed to be
savin' money at your age, ain't ya?
 Nobody likes emptyin' their wallet...
But ya still gotta do it!
Let's see... I think I'll take a
delicious life stone. One oughta do.
  Ho ho! You're well-behaved for your age.
   You ain't got the goods!? Anyone who'd
negotiate without life stones is a real
terror...
   Hey! You're comin' up short! Lyin' never
pays!
 You don't get it, do ya? There ain't no
door a life stone can't open. Ya best
keep that in mind.
   Nobody likes emptyin' their wallet...
But ya still gotta do it!
I ain't no profiteer, but I'd like a
 very much.
  You'll give it to me? I guess anything's
worth a shot. Hohoho.
 It was my mistake.
 Ho ho ho! I was just tryin' to be a bit
ambitious. Don't pay this old man no
heed.
 Argh! What a waste! You tryin' to make
a mockery of livin' within your means!?
 Lemme see... I'll take food over flowers
any day. Gimme some life.
 Ho ho! How delicious! I better not
over-eat. Gives me indigestion!
 Eh? You feelin' alright? You gotta take
better care of yourself.
   Argh! Ya won't let me take any!? You
shouldn't be so finicky!
  Really!? Well, I understand the need to
be modest!
 What's that!? Ya say there're things
even I can't accomplish? Intriguing!
  I'm old. I shouldn't strain myself...
  That's right! Gimme the details, and
I'll give ya my ear.
  Hohoho, you've got some fine pickins.
Maybe it's worth complyin' with you...
   Hey! Ain't no worse negotiation tactic
than bribery!
   What ya gettin' all excited about!?
I never said I'd give ya my spell card!
Heh, I'm glad yer honest.
  Eh? You don't need it? Well yer no
fun...
  Argh! You don't get it! That won't
effect me in the slightest!
 Ah, you haven't taken the first step
toward spirituality. Not that I blame ya
at your age.
 Wh-Whatchya plannin' on rippin'!?
I don't understand you scary humans at
all...
*nod* You're a good, earnest lad.
  Argh! Fine then!
   Eh? I'm losin' interest here.
  If I'm just a number for yer body count,
I ain't goin' down without a fight!
   Ugh... What do you think you're doin'?
You're scarin' the daylights outta me...
Oh, that was a joke? Ya got me! You
looked so real. Hohoho.
I thought I was retired, but duty calls
me yet again...*sigh*
  You plannin' on cookin' me? Demons ain't
so edible. So what're you planning...?
Ho, ho! You want to hear the ramblings
of an old man? Sure! I'll indulge ya.
   Oh... You knew... Well roll me in corn
flour and call me dinner. I got upset
over nothin'.
 What!? I ain't protected by the law!?
  Argh! Discrimination is evil!
Especially like that!
Ho, ho! Sounds like I read into it too
much. My apologies.
 Is that so? It's fine then.
Don't ask questions of a closed mouth...
The world's full of scary things...
   *sigh* I ain't dealin' with a child
that can't understand me.
  You could be singin' a cappella for all
I care. It don't change your rhythm!
   Hrm... That one wasn't too bad. Kinda
soothing.
On top of that, you've got a short fuse.
...I can't handle all this malarky.
   So ya did lose your marbles... Poor
thing...
   Hey! Smile all you want, but it's
insincere. And your horrible voice is
still horrible!
Hoho! That's good, that's good.
Hmph! It's rough dealin' with simpletons
who get fixated on one thing!
 Eh? You're done already? That's a shame.
   Hmph... Such obvious brown-nosin'...
   I'm sorry to say it, but I think I'm
too old to help you.
  Hohoho, so you let the wind carry you
where it will, eh? That's interesting.
   So now that ya know, you should back
out while ya can.
 Hmm...? You speak your mind, don't ya?
But still, you're here to negotiate
with me, aren't ya? Bet I'm right.
 Argh! What an unruly whippersnapper!
Time to bring out the wooden spoon!
   Ho, ho! Missy, you know just how to
flatter a demon!
   What...? That's all I am...?
   Hey! If I'm less than straw, then who
are you to come beggin' for favors!?
 Are you a fool!? I was talkin' about
the rarest kind of beauty!
Hohoho. It's a good thing you're cute,
'cause you're downright dumb.
   Ho, ho! Figuring out the meaning of my
words takes skill.
  What!? So what if it was sarcasm, no
need to get all blustered over it!
Oh... That all? Well roll me in corn
flour and call me dinner. I got upset
over nothin'.
   Hm, you won't do nothin'?
  I can't trust you just like that. You
must be up to somethin'...
   Wh-What are you plannin' to eat? You
wouldn't feast on my soul, would ya...?
   Hohoho! I'm happy to hear that.
Argh! It's a matter of fact! Stop
your jibberjabberin'!
Ho, ho! We're like peas in a pod.
  Oh, you're busy? So much for takin'
you some place nice...
 You're so busy that you're beggin' me...
The human world must be tough...
  You got nerves of steel or somethin'?
Modern women give me the willies...
  ...Then it's okay.
 Argh! What a rude young lady! I've had
it up to here!
  Hohoho! I'll take anything I can get.
  Argh! It's got a different meaning!
Back to the books with you!
That's right... But with a demeanor
like that... This is pretty fishy...
   That ain't quite right.
Ho, ho! You lost your memory? Well,
start lookin' for it.
  Hey! Why'd you stop!? Couldn't keep up
with your lies!?
Hmm... It IS up to me. I apologize.
That was rude to the deer? Well, then
I apologize to 'em.
  Hohohoho, that's right.
You're a little too obedient. I think
this is goin' a little too well...
   Oh, so that WAS a lie. In the end, I'm
just an old fogey...
Yer right.
 ...That ain't good...
  Argh! Sure, you're fine with it, but
I'm the one who's done for!
   Oh, you ain't half bad after all.
Obedient kids are the best kind.
 I don't care much for kids who ignore
the teachings of their elders.
   You don't get it! I ain't gonna bother
with kids who treat the words of the
elderly like trash!
...Er, I wasn't expectin' a straight
answer...
 ...You're fine with men!? Well, in my
day, that wouldn't fly...
Exactly! I agree!
  Ho, ho! That joke's a classic. You're
quite the entertainer!
   You ain't makin' sense! Who're you
callin' Mrs. Kawasaki!?
 Not sure I get that joke... I think
you told it wrong...
   Wha...? What's that?
   What're you sayin'!? If that's really
what ya want, I'll turn ya red!
  Unfortunately, it doesn't turn green
very easily...
Don't... hoho! Say... That...! Hoho!
Stop... hoho! Me... Urgh! Rah! My laughing stopped!
I'm in pain and you're joking around!?
You inconsiderate good-for-nothin'!
 Ack! I can't do anything shameful from
now on!
 ...That so? Fine by me, as long as we
aren't talking about my weakness...
  ...Don't say tragic things like that...
No! That's not good! I'll fix ya right
up!
 True, but I still prefer a hot bath.
   No, you are. You need to be more aware
of things!
  Ho, ho! You know how to play the relaxed
card!
 Hey! You can't have that kinda attitude
if you're gonna carry the weight of
the world someday!
 ...Why ya gotta be so violent toward
an old man...?
Urgh... Blast, I'm all shook up. You
got me there.
 Argh! Give it your best shot!
  ...Don't say that. Pull 'em...
 You really want the hair on my ass!?
Whatchya gonna do, sniff 'em...?
  You'll pull 'em out over my dead body!
 No, no. Livers are better as sashimi.
  If you cool off any more than this, I'll
lose what little vigor I've got...
Why'd you rub!?
Oh, well if you ain't got any, then
I don't need it.
   Argh! What's with that attitude!? The
customer is always right!
Who's... that...?
  Nothin' quite like sittin' at the
kotatsu and snackin' on tangerines...
I ain't good with animals, but I've
got a soft spot for kitties.
   I hate cats!
   ...Looks like I'll be able to bite you!
Of course! You don't know any proverbs!?
   Well, of course... I don't think I'd
try that, even if you asked...
Ooh! It looks really good close up!
Hohoho. You're an honest one.
I'm rootin' for ya.
  Hey! I haven't sunk low enough to
allow some kid to tell me off!
   Hohoho! You're so aggressive, I don't
feel the need to get angry!
  Argh! Your lips just keep on flappin'!
I'll turn 'em black and blue!
   ...Seems you aren't all talk...
I couldn't look my ancestors in the face
if I let this mockery slide! You need
to be punished, child!
  Of course. Don't take me so literally.
 Ho, ho! What an outrageous story! I can
see why you're a good talker.
  Hohoho. You're surprised too?
  I hope it rains... This drought's makin'
me anxious...
 It rains all the time! ...Well, it
hasn't been lately.
 That's right. All you had to do was
apologize.
 That's right. All you had to do was
apologize. Not that you can get by on
good manners your whole life...
  Argh! This is beyond passin' or failin'!
You've let down the human race!
   Young'uns are scary these days...
  Young'uns are scary these days...
  Oh, you don't get it...? Well that
really ticks me off!
Hohoho! That's okay.
   What's that supposed to mean!? You got
no right to be testin' your elders!
 Hohoho, I see through everything!
  Argh! You got the guts to keep up yer
innocent little act!? Cut it out!
So the true self is revealed! It's time
to put this old man to the test!
   That's cents.
  No matter what you say, it's useless on
me now.
Hey! That wasn't sarcastic! I'm not so
easily fooled!
  Ho, ho! I haven't been aging for
nothing.
  If I had time, I'd coach ya through it,
but... Maybe next time.
Is that how you treat someone who's
genuinely worried about you!?
  Is that so...? Well that ain't much
different than me...
   Ready? Take a good look! ...... ......
I'm gettin' all stiff. I quit.
  I was ready to give ya a helpin' hand.
You're a damn fool of a boy!
...Look at me...
   You wanna hear my stories!? I'll give ya
all the stories ya want when we're
finished negotiating here.
 Well... Sometimes less is more...
  There, there, young man. Give an old
man his time in the sun.
  Hohoho. It's pointless. I'm in a state
of spiritual awakening.
 Argh! You don't get it, do you!? It's
useless!
 Whatchya plannin' on rippin'!? There
ain't nothin' here to rip...
  Argh! Fine then!
   You're fessin' up already? Just when my
blood pressure was spikin'...
  Whaddaya mean by that!? You're one
arrogant kid.
   If I'm just a number for yer body count,
I ain't goin' down without a fight!
   Ugh... What do you think you're doin'?
You're scarin' the daylights outta me...
Oh, that was a joke? Ya got me! You
looked so real. Hohoho.
Why you lookin' for that? You'll get
one soon enough.
  Which means... You don't mean you like
me, do ya?
  Which means... Ho, ho! You're sniffin'
out my weakness, aren't ya!?
I told ya not to look, so why are you
looking!?
Er... You don't need to do that...
 R-Right there. That's the spot! ...Ooh!
You're good at eggin' on the elderly,
ain't ya!? ...Good to know...
Your humility betrays you... You're up
to no good...
   Hey! That ain't the right answer! You're
supposed to sing my praises there!
That's a lie! I know you're two-faced!
 Ho ho... You can tell such monstrous
lies with only two faces? Humans are
clever indeed...
 That's some fuzzy math... Don't tell me
humans' faces split with every lie...
  If that's what you think, then I don't
care anymore.
   Quit nitpickin'! You're just tryin' to
find fault with everything!
 Hrm, if you examine them with a keener
eye, it'll be different... This is a
doozy.
 Hey! Talkin' big is fine, but no lying!
Lying is for lowlifes!
 Ho, ho! You'll come back? Well...
I'll be.
 You're not makin' much conversation
here...
That's downright irresponsible!
Good idea! I'll stop my heart, and you
tell me a scary story!
  Why an elbow? I don't understand the
western style...
  I see... So you mean everything is a
learning experience.
  You mean you WANT to face a situation
like that? ...I don't get it.
Oh, is that so?
Huh? You suspicious of me?! What a rude
little lady!
   To tell you the truth, there is one
thing I'm scared of. But it's a secret.
Ho, ho! I haven't been growin' old for
no reason!
  Hohoho. So you've got a nice personality
too. Maybe you'll be the next Marilyn.
Ho, ho! That was a bald-faced lie. You
should start over with voice lessons.
   Hrm... Maybe in 300 more years.
Not that! Noooooooo!
   What a twisted young lady... I think
it'll be best if we just stop the
negotiations right here...
  That song changes key in funny places...
I don't know who wrote it, but isn't
that bad for its marketability?
 Hrm... Now that's a song you can take
pride in!
I only speak the truth.
What is this new-fangled thing? A
silver plate? Some kinda mirror, maybe?
You think I'm serious? I know what a CD
is, dagnabbit!
  Is... Is that so...? Well, I'm a more
old fashioned ჹ, so...
   I-Is that so!? I may be an old fashioned
ჹ, but I can still hold my own!
   You makin' fun of my age!? I got news
for ya, I ain't that old yet!
I s'pose I did let my temper flare up
a bit there... I apologize, so let's
let bygones be bygones.
 Sorry about that. No need to get angry
now.
You makin' fun of my age!? I got news
for ya, I ain't that old yet!
That's how it should be! Girls should
be sweet and obedient.
   I can't believe that... If you ain't an
angel, I can't trust humans anymore...
 Well, angels are stubborn and prissy,
even if they are messengers of God.
'Course, I'm talkin' about the general
definition here.
 I thought I'd retired, but looks like
I've got more work to do... *sigh*
   Materials? What's your plan for me,
Missy? You aren't gonna eat me...
  You actually want to hear the ramblings
of an old man, Missy? How commendable...
   Argh! You sayin' I ain't got the right!?
Hmph! Quit yer tomfoolery!
What are you sayin'!? The world is all
brother and sister, ain't we!?
Then you gotta be friendly to demons
too, Missy.
You shouldn't discriminate just 'cause
I'm a demon... Don't they teach you
that in school...?
  Ho, ho! I'm happy as a ripe plum! You're
a nice little lady.
   ...Of course. Long as yer with me,
you'll see benefits.
...So who's got the short straw here?
Me...?
   ...What a lady...
  Ho, ho! If you're happy, so am I!
  If you're bored, then do somethin'
else! Why waste time!?
  Argh! I can't take it any longer!
I won't forgive ya, even if you're
beggin' for it!
   That's right. All ya had to do was
apologize.
  The old man isn't even in the picture,
eh...?
  It's nice to be worried about... You're
a kind young lady, Missy.
  Reassurance like that just makes me
miserable now...
   You're goin' that far!? Then I'll dig
up my ol' supremacy and show you!
Eh? You say they've got skin-care
products these days? That's somethin'.
   Burnin' your skin with the sun sounds
like crazy talk to us demons.
No, no. That's your charm. I like it.
  It is! I like pure, Japanese girls!
Think you get it? Women do have two
sides, after all...
...Alright, I admit, I'm just an old-
fashioned demon...
   That's true, but... you're pretty calm.
I know that. I'm just happy to feel my
heart throb for the first time in forever.
  No! It won't work! Love between a human
and a ჹ is taboo. We'd have
a terrible split...
Good girl. When that day comes, I'll be
sure and deliver it to ya.
 Hey! Don't get picky now!
There are plenty of demons out there
havin' a tougher go of it than you!
What a high-maintenance girl... Tell
ya what, I'll make a cake if ya stop
the waterworks.
  That was a firm reply, but are you
really independent? I'm worried...
  If you say this is how you like it, then
I'm gonna stop caring!
I understand wanting to shelter a child,
but people gotta grow, too.
   Ooh! Just like you said! There's a food
called bagels! Eastern and western
cultures can be so diverse!
 Hey! I ain't Japanese! I'm a demon!
What's makin' that 'ding' sound? Is
there a monk with a bell trapped in
there...?
  Hohoho, it wouldn't be so hard if you
could say it yourself. You're a strange
little lady.
 Well, that's how it is.
Nope, not always. Even if they're
small, an aura of strength is deceiving.
 Argh! Missy, you've said all that I can
take. I've had it with ya!
 I ain't got so much pride...
   If you're just gonna end up apologizing,
why'd you use that tactic in the first
place!?
Why!? A good demon like me is hard to
come by!
 Well, I AM a demon, but we're not all
bad, ya know.
*sigh* Come on now, don't tease the
elderly.
   ...You're a genuine bully...
   Hey! I hate bullying!
  Ho, ho! I always wanted to be a bully!
Take that! And that! And that too!
  Ho, ho! You're on fire! I see you're
quite an accomplished bully!
  Oh, oh, ohhh... I'm old, can't ya
be nice?
 ...S-So you're a masochist as well,
Missy?
 I see, I see. That's good to hear...
I'm glad there are reputable men still
out there!
 Hohoho... "Women's suffrage," eh? It
sounds fancy, but I'm rootin' for ya!
 Hey! I was worried about ya. There's no
need to put it like that!
  Argh! Confidence like that'll lower your
guard, and that's how ya get hurt!
Er... I'd like it if you'd talk to
me a little longer...
   I must be gettin' old if a little
missy is concerned about me...
   Hohoho! You like being considered a
greenhorn, Missy!?
 That was just a figure of speech.
I wasn't callin' ya a rookie.
Whatchya ignoring me for...? What a
capricious girl...
 Hoho! I like anything that goes well
with liquor!
  Yes, I hate 'em! Although I might be
interested in a pickled girl! Hohoho!
 Stew? Are you understandin' the words
that are comin' outta my mouth!?
 Ho, ho! Are you embarrassed? You are
quite a maiden.
   Why'd you get all huffy? I don't
understand girls lately...
That's right. I'm just dandy.
  Hey! If you're gonna deny it, keep right
on ignoring me!
   This is quite a shy girl we have here.
That's a rarity these days.
 Argh! I'm takin' notice!
   Come now, Missy, you gotta be a little
more amiable. Drop that temper of yours.
...And you're still ignoring me... I'm
gonna go sulk.
  Hey! I haven't rotted yet! Stop tryin'
to classify me!
 That's right! I've still got wood to
burn! I feel more confident already,
thanks to you!
   Just as you say... I don't have any
passion left to burn...
That's right! You're a man of virtue!
But let's leave it at that...
...Th-That ain't what I meant... Don't
be offended...
  ...Never mind...
   If ya don't like it, never mind...
 ...You got bad eyes...? Or is it...?
   I'm a rat!? I won't stand for this!
There are some cruel humans out there...
   If I were reborn, I'd have another life
like this...? Noooo!
   Is that so!? I'm glad to hear there's
a second life. Makes me happy.
   Ugh! Wh-What are you doing!?
   Blergh... Wh-Why'd you deck me outta
the blue like that...?
S-Stop that, please! I beg of ya!
  I-I apologize... Pretend ya never heard
that...
All you have to do is apologize, but
you're too much of a big shot to do
that...? I don't like you...
  You've pushed me too far! Now it's the
pride of the ჹwe're dealin' with!
I've got myself a challenge!
  No matter what you say... I was born a
demon, and there's nothin' that can
change that...
  That's right! Exactly! Ya can't judge
something by good or evil alone!
 If it's got nothin' to do with me, then
leave me out of it... Catch my drift?
  ...I was bein' set up?
 Hohoho! See, just as I thought. You
can't fool these eagle eyes.
   I-I get it... I-I'll listen... You don't
have to scream...
 So THAT'S your negotiation technique?
There sure are strange humans out there.
 Which means... you're just an oddball!
Someone do sometin' about this guy!
 Is that so...? Still, you're quite the
annoying young man...
   Hrrmm... "Die..." I'm gonna die!?
  Hrm... I'm hungry...? Give me a card...
I don't know.
  ...How primitive...
...You're pretty stingy...
 ...Well, you cast your line, and now
I'm hooked. Please, tell me...
Oooh! Excellent move! That one was
incredible!
If you showed me more things like that,
I wouldn't need to know!
   Wh-What the!? What in tarnation are you
yelling for!?
  Th-That wasn't it...? Sorry, didn't mean
to be suspicious. Will you keep going?
Hoho. You're like a carriage horse.
Being dedicated is a good thing.
   Why...? Nothing good comes from living
a rebellious life.
  That makes me happy. You look like a
lie, but you're a good kid.
   Hmph! You have all the free time in the
world! If you don't want to, say so!
   Ho, ho! Then let's negotiate!
  I'm not so much a demon as I am a
ჹ...
 I happen to be on a stroll too.
I think you and I could get along.
 It's too late now. No sense cryin' over
spilt milk.
Be careful next time.
 What are you complaining about? It's
first come, first serve for things like
this.
 Ahhhh! Stop it! It's gonna stink like
humans...! Noooo, it's done for!
 Hey! That's a child's answer! Don't toy
with me!
   Is that so!? That's downright cruel!
But I want to eat it too...
   ...I don't get it...
   The more ya have to suck out, the more
flavorful it gets! That's dried squid!
Delicious, I say!
Hey! My teeth ain't what they used to
be! I can't eat such hard food!
  I don't need that.
 Hey! It's obvious ya don't wanna!
  That's right. Now there's a good
attitude.
 If you're just gonna ignore me, why'd
you answer my first question!? I don't
understand...
 Ho ho. You young'uns don't understand
the emotion of a moonless night.
 A moonless night makes surprise attacks
easy... You're plannin' somethin'...
   That's really strange. You and I both
have more to learn.
  ...I've never played this game you're
goin' on about...
...I've heard of that before, but
where...?
You're mischief. You don't have to tease
me, do ya? Come on, do somethin'.
 Argh! You ain't gonna listen!?
Time to put a rebellious boy in his
place!
 You're obedient... But after seein'
those eyes of yours, I can't trust ya...
   Hey! You're not supposed to interrupt!
If ya can't wait for someone to finish
talkin', I'll have to punish you!
   Ho, ho! How brazenly you speak!
Interesting! Let's negotiate.
  I'll give ya the ol' one-two! Don't be
talkin' that hogwash!
   ...Oh well.
That's right! Now that I think about it,
I feel like we've met before...
Sorry, all you humans look alike...
  Ho, ho! It's just a human. I got all
worried over nothin'.
 ...Yer really a demon? You smell sorta
human...
