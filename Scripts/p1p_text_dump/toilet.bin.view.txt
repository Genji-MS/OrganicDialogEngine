彻 ʛ츛˰츛Ԃ츛ઢ츛  蛳 Ἒ̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺I don't really get what you're saying,
mister, but I think I can help you.
 Hmm... You're actually pretty reliable,
mister.
  Hey! Don't talk crap just 'cause I'm a
toilet ghost!
   Your story sounds like a big phony to me!
Is it for real?
Say what you want, but you wanna sit on
me, huh? This is one comfortable toilet
seat, after all!
   Hee hee! You're trying to persuade me...
In other words, you need me, right?
 Normally someone who taunted a toilet
would be seen as a freak... but you
might be an interesting person.
  You seem strong, mister! So, what are
your plans for me?
 ...Fine! See if I play with you anymore!
   You're a smooth talker, mister!
  W-Waaaaah! You get your kicks out of
taunting a toilet...?
 W-Waaaaah! I'm scared...
 I don't really get what you're saying,
mister, but I feel like I'm being
invited.
  I don't mind thinking about that...
but I hate people who promise to pay
up later!
Hey! Don't talk crap just 'cause I'm a
toilet ghost!
   Your story sounds like a big phony to me!
Is it for real?
I'm in kind of a rush... Um, can I
leave now...?
   D-Don't tell me you're going to
kidnap me...?
You really wanna show off how good you
can sing, huh? You're a lousy human!
Don't act all cool over something like
that! I'm way better than you!
Y-You're better than me...
 Do they call you Donald or something!?
Seriously, just stop...
   You're not nearly as good as me, but I
think you have talent.
  Hee hee! You're pretty good!
 I don't really get what you're saying,
miss, but I think I can help you.
   I don't mind thinking about that...
but I hate people who promise to pay
up later!
Hey! Don't talk crap just 'cause I'm a
toilet ghost!
   Your story sounds like a big phony to me!
Is it for real?
Say what you want, but you wanna sit on
me, huh? This is one comfortable toilet
seat, after all!
   I don't mind thinking about that...
but I hate people who promise to pay
up later!
Helloooo! It's completely obvious that
you don't mean it!
  Don't you have any pride, miss? I hate
girls like you more than anything!
W-Waaaah! You're up to something...
You're... complimenting me, right...?
I've heard a lot of rumors about you,
Miss Maki...
 Hee hee! Modesty is the way to go! Yep!
I always knew I was too perfect! I even
scare myself... squee!
   I don't really get what you're saying,
miss, but you might be right.
   You're pretty easy to trick, huh miss?
But that's what makes you so cute!
  Hey! Don't say whatever comes to mind!
It's easy to tell you're lying!
 Your story sounds like a big phony to me!
Is it for real?
Say what you want, but you wanna sit on
me, huh? This is one comfortable toilet
seat, after all!
   Hee hee! I can't believe your story, miss.
Hee hee hee! Of course, it would be
different if you gave me something!
   You really get it! I like people who are
on the ball!
  Huh... I thought you were just plain dumb,
miss... But you actually know what you're
doing when it comes to demons!
  Helloooo! It's completely obvious that
you don't mean it!
  Don't you have any pride, miss? I hate
girls like you more than anything!
Hee hee! Modesty is the way to go! Yep!
I always knew I was too perfect! I even
scare myself... squee!
   Huh... well, that was weird! But you
seem cool, so I don't mind!
   I don't mind going out with you, as long
as it's just to grab a bite. It's your
treat, right?
D-Do I look that easy to pick up...?
I don't think I like that...
  I'm only interested in toilets!
You're out of the picture!
   You're not a guy, so... pass.
  You're not a guy, so... pass.
  Hee hee! Are you hitting on me? I'm glad
to know there are people with a toilet
fetish--maybe I have a chance!
 Whoa, are you hitting on me? I'm glad,
but... Hee hee! What should I do?
 Do you really want my attention that bad?
You're like a kid, mister!
   Hee hee! I heard that entertainers are
really smart!
   What's up with that!?
  This is so boring! I don't even get what
the joke's supposed to be!
  W-Waaaaaah! This is so lame...
 Huuuh!? No way! You're a weird guy...
Hee hee! My tummy hurts!
   Hee hee! Listening to students gossiping
is way more fun!
When you're stuck in a bathroom for so
long, you really get the itch to talk
about stuff like this...
  Huh... don't you know any stories that
are more interesting?
 This isn't the time to be talking about
that stuff! Man, you're really killing
the mood!
   Will you be serious for once!? I'm telling
you, this isn't the time to be talking
about that stuff!
  Thanks for telling me a story! Ooh, I'll
tell you a great story I know later!
  Thanks for telling me a story! But what
I like most of all is badmouthing people!
Do you really want my attention that bad?
You're like a kid, mister!
   Wh-What was that just now!?
  Wh-What was that!? Oh... I see... I get
it now! You really piss me off!
What's wrong with you!? Are you stupid
or something!?
W-Waaaaah! What are you up to?
You're like, in outer space!
Are you okay, mister? You could break
something if you're that hyper...
Calm down a little, okay?
You're giving me a present? Huh...
 Are you from a rich family? Then you can
give me more, right!?
   Hey! A gift like that will clog up
the toilet!
 I don't want something boring like that!
Don't you have anything better?
 Hee hee! Yaaaay! I got a present!
  Hee hee! Make more offerings to me! More!
I don't really get what you're saying,
mister, but you might be right.
 Hmm... You're actually pretty reliable,
mister.
  Hey! Don't make up stuff!
  Your story sounds suspicious to me!
Is it for real?
  Say what you want, but you wanna sit on
me, huh? This is one comfortable toilet
seat, after all!
   Hee hee! You're making a big speech, but
what you mean is, you need me, right?
   Normally someone who yelled at a toilet
would be seen as a freak... but you
might be an interesting person.
If you say you're strong, mister, I guess
you are! So, what are your plans for me?
   ...Fine! See if I play with you anymore!
   You're a smooth talker, mister!
  W-Waaaaah! You get your kicks out of
surprising a toilet...?
   W-Waaaaah! I'm scared...
 Say what you want, but you've got one
nasty personality, mister...
 Hey, mister, is this your first time
talking to a girl?
  I'm actually older than you, you know!
Now start acting normal!
You should brush up on your negotiation
skills... If you want to live a long
life, that is!
  Hee hee! I get so embarrassed when you
praise me that much...
  Hee hee! You're smart too, aren't you,
mister!?
  Hmm... Not bad at all!
 Hey, you're pretty good! Teach me too
next time!
 Awww, you suck. You're the worst!
  Yikes, what're you doing!? The bathroom's
that way! I'm not letting you use mine!
Hee hee! You're so cool!
   Hee hee! This is my first time seeing
a human dance!
 Normally someone who taunted a toilet
would be seen as a freak... but you
might be an interesting person.
  You seem strong, mister! So, what are
your plans for me?
 ...Fine! See if I play with you anymore!
   You're a smooth talker, mister!
  W-Waaaaah! You get your kicks out of
surprising a toilet...?
   W-Waaaaah! I'm scared...
 Huh... So are you curious about my
toilet? You're so weird!
What is it? Are you THAT curious about
my toilet?
What...? What's wrong with me being in
a toilet? You got a problem with that!?
 Stop staring at me!
  You're staring at me all dreamily!
Hee hee! It's 'cause I'm pretty.
Hmm? What's wrong? Never seen a demon
as cute as me?
 I don't really get what you're saying,
mister, but you might be right.
 You're pretty easy to trick, huh mister?
But that's what makes you so cute!
Hey! Don't make up stuff!
  Your story sounds like a big phony to me!
Is it for real?
Say what you want, but you wanna sit on
me, huh? This is one comfortable toilet
seat, after all!
   Hee hee! I can't believe your story,
mister. Of course, it would be
different if you gave me something!
   You're such a kid for believing in
something like that!
So what are you hinting? That I'm like
one of those ghosts, too?
 W-Waaaaah! I'm scared!
 W-Waaaaah! I'm not one of those demons
who likes stuff like that!
You know, my stories are much scarier
than that! You wanna hear one?
 I wanna go to a spooky place on a dare,
too! Do you know anywhere I could do
something like that?
Hmm, that was pretty good. You've got
talent, miss!
Let's do a duet next time! I'll do
Posh's part!
  You really wanna show off how good you
can sing, huh? You're a lousy human!
Don't act all cool over something like
that! I'm way better than you!
You're not nearly as good as me, but I
think you have talent.
  Hee hee! It feels so nice...
 Hmm... Sure, I'll play along! How ish it
going, Mommy?
 Huhhh... I'm not that much of a kid,
you know.
   You're the worst! I'm gonna finish
you off...!
 What a rude human! You don't have any
manners at all!
For some reason, I'm feeling all
nostalgic... Hee hee!
 Hee hee! This is kinda fun!
  I don't really get what you're saying,
miss, but I feel like I'm being invited.
I don't mind thinking about that...
but I hate people who promise to pay
up later!
Hmph! You're planning on stealing my
toilet, aren't you? Not happening!
Your story sounds like a big phony to me!
Is it for real?
Say what you want, but you wanna sit on
me, huh? This is one comfortable toilet
seat, after all!
   So in other words... you need my toilet?
 Huh... Say what you want... I'm just
a toilet, after all.
  Hey, you better brush up on your
negotiation skills. You want to live
a long life, don't you!?
   You're the worst! I'm gonna finish
you off...!
 What a rude human! You don't have any
manners at all!
W-Waaaaah! Even if I am just a toilet,
you're still too mean...
W-Waaaaah! A tanned girl told me off!
How humiliating...
 It feels kinda weird, being seduced by
a girl... But I... kinda don't mind.
I don't mind going out with your if it's
just to have some tea... It'll be your
treat, right?
I'm a girl! I only go with boys!
   Oh, is that so... then I'll play extra
nice with you, heheh!
 Hee hee! I was waiting for you to talk
to me!
  Hee hee! I like you, Ayase...!
   Stories like that really get to me...
*sniffle*
Cheer up! Not everything in life is bad!
 You think I'm gonna fall for a trick
like that? How stupid are you?
Will you just quit it!? I already know
those are fake tears!
 I-I didn't do anything! You just started
crying for no reason...
   Why'd you have to start crying...?
   Normally someone who threatened a toilet
would be seen as a freak... but you
might be an interesting person.
   You seem strong, miss! So, what are
your plans for me?
   ...Fine! See if I play with you anymore!
   You're a smooth talker, miss!
W-Waaaaah! You get your kicks out of
threatening a toilet...?
  W-Waaaaah! I'm scared...
 You're the worst! I'm gonna flush you
all the way out to the ocean!
You're so rude all of a sudden! You don't
have any manners at all!
   W-Waaaaah! Please stop, miss...
W-Waaaaah! Why're you bullying me!?
I didn't do anything!
Hee hee! I think I'm starting to like
it when you torment me!
  Hee hee! I've been a bad girl...
so bully me more!
   I don't really get what you're saying,
miss, but I think I can help you.
   Hmm... You're actually pretty reliable,
miss.
Isn't there something wrong with you if
you're trying to persuade a toilet!?
   Your story sounds like a big phony to me!
Is it for real?
Say what you want, but you wanna sit on
me, huh? This is one comfortable toilet
seat, after all!
   If you're interested in me, it means you
need this toilet, right?
Will you shut up!? I won't think twice
about flushing you out to sea, you know!
You're so rude all of a sudden! You don't
have any manners at all!
   W-Waaaah! I'm sorry...
 W-Waaaaah! Why're you scolding me!?
I didn't do anything!
Hee hee! You're real full of energy!
   Hee hee! I've been a bad girl...
so scold me more!
   Huh, you're pretty confident. I'll be
impressed if you can keep that up until
the end.
 Huh...? Miss, don't you want something
with me?
  Hey! Don't ignore me! Ooh, how annoying!
   So you're gonna ignore me, huh? Hmph!
How dare you make fun of me like that!?
Did I do something...?
 Um... Didn't you need something from me?
 Huh, you're pretty confident. I'll be
impressed if you can keep that up until
the end.
 Huh...? Mister, don't you want something
with me?
Hey! Don't ignore me! Ooh, how annoying!
   So you're gonna ignore me, huh? Hmph!
How dare you make fun of me like that!?
Did I do something...?
 Um... Didn't you need something from me?
 Normally someone who threatened a toilet
would be seen as a freak... but you
might be an interesting person.
   You seem strong, mister! So, what are
your plans for me?
 ...Fine! See if I play with you anymore!
   You're a smooth talker, mister!
  W-Waaaaah! You get your kicks out of
threatening a toilet...?
  W-Waaaaah! I'm scared...
 Will you shut up!? Go roar someplace else!
 Will you shut up!? Are you stupid or
something!?
 W-Waaaaah! What're you roaring for?
Y-You're dangerous, I can tell...!
 Are you okay, mister? You could break
something if you're that hyper...
Calm down a little, okay?
You're weird, mister! But you seem cool,
so I don't mind!
  Hee hee! You're crazy! I like dangerous
people!
  You'd go as far as pulling out magic
tricks to get me to play with you?
You're such a kid, mister!
 Huh... so you're a sorcerer!
 W-Waaaaah! There's something spooky
about this guy... I-I'm scared...
  Don't try anything funny, like making
me disappear, okay...?
 Magic tricks, huh...? Hee hee!
You're so refined, mister!
  Hey, Mr. Handsome! Use your magic to
conjure me up a new toilet!
 Hmm... Human stories are interesting!
I love listening to them.
Why're you being so serious...? Huh...
Do you think I'm that charming?
 I don't mind listening to your story,
but you know, it'd be nice if my wallet
was heavier...
  That's the worst story I've ever heard!
So stupid!
 It's no use going on and on about stupid
stuff like that to me!
Your story's boring, you know! But if
you gave me something, maybe I'd be in
a good mood again...
 W-Waaaaah! That glare you have when you
talk to me is scary...
 I hesitate to bring this up, but...
you're scaring me...
   Hee hee! It's been a long time since
I've been this happy!
 Hee hee! It's been a long time since
I heard such a fun story!
 Hee hee! This is so much fun... I wish I
could keep chatting like this forever...
  Hmm... You actually have a keen eye for
demons... I have some pretty high
expectations for you!
C'mon! Just negotiate, no frills!
  I totally understand what you want to
say! So you should listen to me, too!
I'm not lending my powers to some human!
Who do you think I am?
Are you stupid or something!? Why would
you ask for help from a toilet like me!?
   Aren't you a human!? Then we have nothing
more to talk about!
Though I might change my tune if you
coughed up a little...
That's what you say now, but you're gonna
trick me, huh? Humans are scary...
   I don't feel like listening to requests
from humans. I really want to just get
out of here...
  I don't feel like listening to requests
from humans. I really want to just get
out of here...
  Huh? You actually want me? Wow, this is
so great!
  Does that mean you want me? Ooh, keep
saying stuff like that!
  Hee hee! My charms drive humans mad, too.
  Aren't you doing that on purpose? Well,
I get it, already, so hurry up and get
to the point.
   I'm kind of interested in people who
aren't quite normal...
If you want to get to know me, there's a
better way to do it than with those tired
negotiation skills!
Did you just make fun of me? I hope you
have a will prepared!
  I see no reason to hold back when I have
to deal with annoying humans like you!
I'm so incredibly annoyed! I won't forgive
you unless you give me something!
  W-Waaaaah! You're so cruel, taunting a
cute demon like me...
   What's wrong with you? Stop making fun
of me... W-Waah!
 W-Waaaaah! I'm just a cute girl...
 Hee hee! You're full of confidence!
Hee hee! Well, it's something a kid like
you would do, so I guess it's okay.
   Hee hee! Well, it's something a kid like
you would do, so I guess it's okay.
   Hmm... could you be a fresh face on the
entertainment scene? Good luck with that!
  Sorry, but not quite! You weren't bad,
though, so please try again sometime!
   Hmm... that wasn't so great, so I'll give
you some advice! But you'll have to pay
up first!
   Boooooriiiing...!
  Bleeeeah! Go home already!
 You expect to make some cash with
something like that? Forget it! I'm the
one who'll be taking money from you!
Wh-What in the world...? I don't get
it at all...
  Was that a ritual or something...?
W-Waaaaah! It's a cultist...!
   Hee hee! Man, you're funny. I could
watch you all day!
 I wish I could do some kind of trick,
too... Maybe I should take up a hobby.
   Hee hee! Show me more!
 Huh... So you want me? Maybe I'll let
myself fall for it!
  Huh... I'm actually much older than
I look. Are you okay with that?
Hmm... I'll think about it, sure...
But you gotta show some generosity!
   Are you making fun of me?
  I can't betray my toilet for that! Do I
LOOK that stupid to you?
   One yell from me and loads of my friends
will show up. You wouldn't want that to
happen, right?
If not, then give me something!
  Uh-oh! I-I was wrong...
Uh-oh! I-I was wrong...
Uh-oh! I-I was wrong...
Oh no... I think I'm falling for it...
 That's a pretty old trick for seducing
people! But that makes it an antique...
So it might be a good thing!
Hee hee! I want something!
Huh... So you have to do stuff like that
because you're so weak!
   Tooooo bad! I can see right through
your schemes!
  Shut up!
   Ugh, you're annoying the crap out of me!
Will you stop it!?
If you want to be my slave, do as I say!
  Something seems wrong... 
You're suspicious...
 Are you scheming something? If you are,
just come out and tell me...
   Hee hee! Maybe I should make you my
bodyguard!
 Hee hee! I feel like I finally have
a minion of my own!
My name seems to be famous in the human
world, too! Hee hee... That's so great!
Huh? You already have my card! You better
take good care of it, okay!?
 Then I'll give you this!
   Huh? Is that so?
   Sorry, it seems like our tastes are
too different.
 Aren't you a little too cocky for how
weak you are? I'm not giving you my card!
Then I'll give you this.
   Well, bye-bye!
 Here's something extra on top!
 I'm gonna get going now!
   I'll give you my card, but don't make too
big of a Persona out of it, okay? I don't
want it clogging up my drain!
  I'll give you this... so please, spare
my life!
Ugh, I've had enough! I'm leaving!
 I'll give you this if you go home like
a good human.
   Sheesh! Humans have made me so angry
lately! Honestly... I feel like a total
idiot for negotiating with you!
   I just don't even care anymore! You want
my spell card? Fine! It's yours!
  Um... I... I want to be useful...
  Here's my spell card... Feel free to make
it into whatever Persona you want!
   I can't fight you...
   This is from me...
 But you're human, so you have at least
a little mercy in you... Right...?
  Oh! I know! I'll give you my spell card!
So please? Please?
Hey, are you doing anything fun now?
 *sniff* *sniff* Hmm, I can smell demons
on you.
Hmm... This is my first encounter with
a human. Give me something to remember
it by!
  What's with that face!? If you've got a
problem, then spit it out!
   I'm in a bad mood today. If you don't get
out of my sight, you'll be sorry!
You obviously have a present for me,
right? Hurry up and give it!
 From this point on is my territory,
got it...?
   I can't stop shivering... Your face is
just that scary.
There's no moon out. That's why I'm scared
and I don't think I can sleep tonight...
Show me some tenderness, mister...
   Hee hee! It's such a nice day today!
 Hey, do you prefer well-behaved girls?
Hee hee!
A full moon! Hee hee! Gimme something!
I got a full schedule, so if you don't
need anything, I'm gonna go.
 I'm busy! If you have something to say,
make it quick!
I'm busy, but if you're gonna give me
something, I'll hear you out!
  Um... if you don't really have any
business with me, I wanna go home.
   A human really wants something with me...?
I don't want any trouble, okay?
If you make one wrong move, I'll be gone
in a flash...
Do you believe in destiny? I feel like
I've waited a long time for this day...
  Do you believe in destiny? I think our
meeting is pretty good proof!
  Eep! I feel like your gaze is sucking
me in!
  Um, do you happen to be Ⴉ?
  No! No! Stay away from me, you
*bleeeeeep*!
   I warn you... i-if you kill me,
you'll regret it...!
  Hey! Don't tell me you think you and me
are on equal grounds here.
  Humans again...? I'm tired of dealing
with all of you! I wanna go home!
   Hey, human! C'mon, where's your gift for
your queen?
 A human... thank goodness! I'll do
anything, just please spare my life!
 I'm all hyper for some reason right
now... I'm all yours!
 I don't think I can resist any more...
I want you to make me your pussycat!
   So what're you trying to say?
  Don't get carried away, lowly human!
   Am I... going to be defeated by a human?
That would be terrible...!
Hee hee! Humans aren't scary like I
thought they'd be!
 Ugh! Stop wasting my time! If you want to
say something, say it!
   ......
I'll listen to your request. But no
cruel stuff, okay?
  I'm in a good mood today. I'll listen
to whatever you say!
 It's too early for me to depart from
this world! There's still so much I want
to do!
   I think I've had enough! I'm tired of
negotiating with you. I'm gonna go look
for some other humans.
   ......
Whether I live or die is all up to you,
isn't it...?
You know what I want? <Amount> yen.
   Hehe, thanks!
  You're terrible! If you don't have money,
you might as well be dead!
   I'm not at all interested in poor people.
  Are you trying to negotiate with me
without paying the price? Isn't that
a little selfish!?
What's with you? You don't even want to
negotiate with me, do you? Ugh, what a
waste of time.
  Gimme one of those things that starts with
"l" and ends with "e"!
  Hee hee! I'm so happy!
 So you were negotiating with me and you
didn't have any life stones? Ohhh, you
make me so mad!
 You don't even have any life stones?
Ugh, how lame...
  Oh, is that so...? Then why don't you
take it with you to hell!?
   You're human and you're that reluctant
to give up your life stones? You're kind
of like a demon that way.
  I want a , darling!
   Lucky me! Just what I wanted...
Nooo! I've been had! And I made a point
only to deal with rich people!
 I've had it! I'm gonna kill you and flush
your corpse to the ocean!
...You can't possibly be my darling,
so I guess I'll let this one slide!
   I'm hungry... just let me have a little
sip. It won't hurt!
Hee hee! I'll be extra gentle!
 Grrr! I only wanted a little.
You're so stingy!
Oh, is that so...? I guess I'll let it
go this time!
   That's nothing to brag about!
  Huh, that's cool of you!
   I can't believe it!
Wait, I can't tell which it is when you
say it like that. What did you mean...?
Hee hee! Don't dodge the question!
Seriously, which is it?
 That's what I thought! Hey, but don't
take a dump on me, okay!?
So you're pretty constipated, huh mister?
Hee hee... just like me!
 What're you holding back for? Hmph!
I know you want to let it all out and
feel refreshed!
  Thank goodness... I was wondering what
I'd do if you went all over me...
   Oh, is that so!? Then why don't we test
it out!? I'm much harder than you!
 W-Waaaaah! You're scary!
   Hmph, don't you understand sarcasm?
Hmmmmm, really? I wonder if I seem like
a cocky demon to others...
 You think so? But I'm still no match
for you, mister.
  Hmm, you're pretty gullible. Hehe...
   You're such an idiot! You'll fall
for anything!
W-Waaaaah! I hate you...!
  I can't believe it!
Hmmm... I think we can get along
pretty good!
  Hee hee! I feel like I'm the heroine
on some show!
 W-Wait a second... are you taking me and
the toilet all together?
  Hee hee! That's good! I can't live
without my toilet!
  What's up with that!? You're just a kid
yourself!
  Really, sound echoes inside a toilet,
so I end up hearing a lot!
   You told me it would be amazing, but I
didn't think it would be THIS good!
Thanks for the tip!
 W-Waaaaah...! I thought I was going
to die...
  It's so bad it could kill me!
Seriously, stop it!
  You were awesome, mister! That was really
cool...! Hee hee!
You still have enough air in you...?
Hey mister, are you really human?
 Hmm, I'm surprised you still have enough
air in you... It's like you're not
even human!
I can't believe it!
Wait, I can't tell which it is when you
say it like that. What did you mean...?
Hee hee! Don't dodge the question!
Seriously, which is it?
 Oh, is that so? You do, huh...?
Oh, is that so? You do, huh...?
Then why don't you use a different
negotiation tactic!?
What's with this human!? Don't
underestimate me!
   That means if I defeat you, I'll be the
next talk of the town!
 Ugh, you're taking it seriously...?
You're soooo stupid!
   Hmm... You know, you're kind of cute,
Maki!
I know you don't want to admit there are
demons out there better than you, but that
attitude has got to go!
Umm... I just like toilets. The toilet
itself isn't my main body...
Really? Hey, what should I do?
Should I become an idol?
I can't believe it!
Wait, I can't tell which it is when you
say it like that. What did you mean...?
Hee hee! Don't dodge the question!
Seriously, which is it?
 W-Waaaaah! Don't get all mad...!
   There's no need to be so embarrassed!
You're so cute, miss!
There's no need to get all embarrassed
over something like this...
 Oh, is that so? You do, huh...?
Oh, is that so? You do, huh...?
Then why don't you use a different
negotiation tactic!?
What's with this human!? Don't
underestimate me!
   I know you don't want to admit there are
demons out there better than you, but that
attitude has got to go!
Umm... I just like toilets. The toilet
itself isn't my main body...
Really? Hey, what should I do?
Should I become an idol?
Just so you don't get the wrong idea,
let me be clear: I'm only going out to
dinner! That's it!
Huh, so you're pretty poor... Well, I
don't mind! No worries!
  Hee hee! You're so dumb!
   Hee hee! Sorry, mister, but toilets are
usually only built for one.
That's right! Now get out of my sight!
 Never mind! I mean, I'm most comfortable
inside a toilet.
  I really shouldn't go with a guy
this easily...
What should I do...? Maybe it'd be best
if I went with you...
  Oh, so that's what you mean! Yes, I get
it now! Hee hee!
   Enough's enough!
   Hey! Don't come over here!
 But... your eyes say otherwise...
  What're you so angry about!? You need to
take criticism better!
Honestly, will you grow up? There's no use
getting mad about criticism.
Hmm... If that made you laugh, you might
have some promise.
Huh, so you do... Then tell me later!
  Oh, is that so...? I'll flush anyone who
bullies me out to the ocean!
  W-Waaaaah! Why're you bullying me...?
  Hey! I just told you to be more serious!
   You know, you should at least listen to
what I have to say!
If you're not going to listen to what
I say, then screw you!!
  Hee hee! You think so?
 Huh... so that's how you are. I think
I misunderstood you, mister.
 Well, SORRY!
   What's with you!? Quit putting on airs!
Uhh, what was that? C'mon, stop being so
high and mighty and tell me!
  It really doesn't help even if you
explain it...
   Hee hee! That's what I thought!
W-Waaaah! You're more dangerous than
a complete idiot!
 Hmph!
  That's right, calm down.
   You're so gross! What's wrong with you!?
Get away from me!
 W-Waaaaah! You're gross...
 Men are so easy to manipulate...
You're naive, too.
Hee hee! Men are so easy to manipulate.
Whaaat? Don't you have any money...?
Stingy people are useless! I don't have
any more time for you!
W-Waaaaah! I'm sorry...
Yay! Hee hee! Thanks, mister!
  You're not gonna give it to me?
Fine, then! Go away!
   Hee hee! I'm so happy!
 That's nothing to brag about!
  Huh, that's cool of you!
   I can't believe it!
W-Waaaaah! This human lied to me!
There's a bad human here!
Hee hee! That's what I thought!
That's what I thought! Hey, but don't
take a dump on me, okay!?
Hee hee! Deep down, you really want it!
What're you holding back for? Hmph!
I know you want to let it all out and
feel refreshed!
  Thank goodness... I was wondering what
I'd do if you went all over me...
   Oh, is that so!? Then why don't we test
it out!? I'm much harder than you!
 W-Waaaaah! You're scary!
   Hmph, don't you understand sarcasm?
Hmm, you're right.
 You think so? But I'm still no match
for you, mister.
  You're so naive that it's easy to trick
you, mister... Hehe...
 You're such an idiot! You'll fall
for anything!
W-Waaaaah! I hate you...!
  Awww, you're cute after all!
   Awww, don't make me kill you! Hee hee!
 I'm gonna kill you!
You better be careful from now on!
 What did you say? It's none of my
business? Dude, like, get your butt
over here right now!
 Hee hee! You're really self-confident!
 That's not true!
   Why're you so excited? Oh, I get it...
You were hoping for something more, huh?
Haha, you're such a perv, mister!
  Oh, is that so!? Fine, then!
   I'm sorry I messed with you! I knew it
was really a dance... please don't relieve
yourself on me!
  You don't even know sarcasm when you
hear it... That's so stupid!
  Wooooow! That's so cool!
   Wait a sec, that was cool! Huh...
I guess humans aren't so bad.
So boooooring!
 Thank goodness... I was wondering what
I'd do if you went all over me...
   Oh, is that so!? Then why don't we test
it out!? I'm much harder than you!
 W-Waaaaah! You're scary!
   Hmph, don't you understand sarcasm?
Hmmmmm, really? I wonder if I seem like
a cocky demon to others...
 You think so? But I'm still no match
for you, mister.
  Hmm... You're... actually pretty nice,
mister!
 You're such an idiot! You'll fall
for anything!
W-Waaaaah! I hate you...!
  W-Waaaaah! I didn't know you went
Asian-style...
   You know, I think it's because everyone's
gotten beat up by you, mister!
   Then why are you staring at me so much?
Oh, could it be...? Hee hee, I'm popular!
  Oh, so I'm right? But is it okay for you
to call over a demoness?
  Screw that, you jerk! I'll flush you
all the way to the ocean!
 But you're totally not my type! You make
me feel all dirty... stop looking!
Hee hee! You're embarrassed, so you're
saying stuff you don't mean.
I understand...
*sigh* Won't you play along even just
a little?
You know, I can't believe it!
  Wait, I can't tell which it is when you
say it like that. What did you mean...?
Ahahaha! Don't dodge the question!
Seriously, which is it?
 Well, I am a demon, so that's how I'd
prefer people to think of me.
Something seems suspicious, but...
 What do you mean, "no"? You can be
such a jerk!
Honestly... Don't talk about stuff
like that!
  Hee hee! Don't talk about stuff like
that anymore, okay?
   W-Waaaah! I don't wanna hear about that
kinda stuff...
 Huh... So you like scary stories...
But you better be careful not to let
yourself get too into them!
   So you were just bluffing! Hee hee!
Huh... You like that kind of thing, miss?
Looks like we might get along real good!
 How would you know about something like
that, miss...?
 Cheapskate!
I gotta practice my moves. This is no
time to be playing around.
   Then I should practice my moves too!
   I can't? That sucks...
 What're you acting all high and mighty
for!? You're just a kid yourself!
   Hee hee! I know... Of course, I'm much
more charming!
  You were awesome, miss! That was really
cool...! Hee hee!
  The drawback of humans is that they get
carried away too easy!
 You can reach such high ranges...
It's like you're not even human!
 Wroooooong!
That's right. I'm an adult! Hee hee!
   Well, I guess that's fine.
 W-Waaaaah! I'm sorry! I don't wanna die...
 Hmph! I'm not scared at all!
   Hee hee! It's even more fun now!
   Awww... so boring!
 I can't believe it!
Wait, I can't tell which it is when you
say it like that. What did you mean...?
Hee hee! Don't dodge the question!
Seriously, which is it?
 That's what I thought! Hey, but don't
take a dump on me, okay!?
So you're pretty constipated, huh miss?
Hee hee... just like me!
   What're you holding back for? Hmph!
I know you want to let it all out and
feel refreshed!
  Huh... You're honest! I have a higher
opinion of you now, miss!
What did you say? It's none of my
business? Dude, like, get your butt
over here right now!
 Well, I guess that's fine.
 W-Waaaaah! I'm sorry! I don't wanna die...
 Hmph! I'm not scared at all!
   Hee hee! In your face!
 Y-You make me so mad!
  Okay, okay. We'll just go Dutch on it!
Man, human women are so stern...
Huh? So you're not going? You're so
scatterbrained, Ayase!
 Boy, Ayase, you sure are naive, huh...?
That was a lie.
You won't get anywhere if you're scared
all the time!
  You won't get anywhere if you're scared
all the time!
  If you die, I'll be sure to flush your
bones for you, miss!
Sheesh, you're annoying! What are you
so scared for!?
  Huh? What're you scared about all of
a sudden...?
  But noble people like you only make me
want to bully them!
 But noble people like you make me want
to bully them even more!
If you don't mind, I'll lend you my help!
  There's a few tricks to fake crying.
I'll teach you some later.
Hee hee! WHATEVER!
 Sheesh! You so don't mean that!
W-Waaaaah! I don't know what to do...
  Hee hee! Thank goodness...
 Thank goodness... I was wondering what
I'd do if you went all over me...
   Oh, is that so!? Then why don't we test
it out!? I'm much harder than you!
 W-Waaaaah! You're scary!
   Hmph, don't you understand sarcasm?
Hmmmmm, really? I wonder if I seem like

for you, miss.
Huh... You're pretty nice, miss!
   You're such an idiot! You'll fall

W-Waaaaah! I hate you...!
  Well, I guess that's fine.
 W-Waaaaah! I'm sorry! I don't wanna die...
 Hmph! I'm not scared at all!
   Oh, so you like that sort of thing!
Okay then, miss!
   You're a fiend!
W-Waaaaah! There's a fiend here...
 Hee hee! I'm so happy!
 Why'd you stop!?
   That kind of mean stuff is... Hee hee,
it's not bad either...
  This isn't something to get all
embarrassed about!
 Huh, that's cool of you!
   I can't believe it!
Wait, I can't tell which it is when you
say it like that. What did you mean...?
Hee hee! Don't dodge the question!
Seriously, which is it?
 That's what I thought! Hey, but don't
take a dump on me, okay!?
So you're pretty constipated, huh miss?
Hee hee... just like me!
   What're you holding back for? Hmph!
I know you want to let it all out and
feel refreshed!
  Well, I guess that's fine.
 W-Waaaaah! I'm sorry! I don't wanna die...
 Hmph! I'm not scared at all!
   Oh, so you like that sort of thing!
Okay then, miss!
   You're a fiend!
W-Waaaaah! There's a fiend here...
 Hee hee! I'm so happy!
 Why'd you stop!?
   That kind of mean stuff is... Hee hee,
it's not bad either...
  You're such a nasty human!
 C'mon, don't tease me like that!
   Are you shy, miss? Hmmm?
   Grrr! You better stop underestimating me!
  What is it? You want something from me,
right...?
  What's with you!? If you don't want
anything with me, get out of my sight!
 Ohhh... If you wanted to negotiate,
you should've said so from the start.
  You're such a nasty human!
 C'mon, don't tease me like that!
   Are you shy, mister? Hmmm?
 Grrr! You better stop underestimating me!
  What is it? You want something from me,
right...?
  What's with you!? If you don't want

  Hehe... You're so naive that it's easy
to trick you, mister!
   You're such an idiot! You'll fall
for anything!
W-Waaaaah! I hate you...!
  Hee hee! That's what I thought!
He admitted it...! W-Waaaah! He's more
dangerous than a normal idiot!
  Hmph!
  That's right, calm down.
   You're so gross! What's wrong with you!?
Get away from me!
 W-Waaaaah! You're gross...
 Hee hee! Just kidding!
I like serious people!
  Don't you want me to like you!?
So you hate me... W-Waaaaah!
   Hee hee! That really surprised me!
 Then what? I'm starting to get scared...
W-Waaaaah!
Huuuuh!? Then what is it? I'm really
curious now!
  Are you going to threaten me!?
Don't underestimate me!
 W-Waaaaah! You're up to something...
   Hee hee! I want the kind with a bidet!
Make sure to deliver it later, okay?
I was lying when I said it was cool!
Cheapskate! You're nowhere near cool!
 W-Waaaaah! You're the worst...
 Hee hee! Sheesh, you're good!
  Wh-What the? Teach me!
 Shut up!
   What's with you? I won't understand
unless you speak up!
   I won't understand unless you speak up.
I won't lose even if you threaten me!
  Hee hee! Okay!
 Territory is territory!
But... territory is territory...
   Nope! You get none!
Hee hee! It seems like it's gonna be
cold this year.
   Well, that was just a formality, so...
Let's see... I want something before we
start negotiating...
   The weather's important, you know!
The moon affects how I feel, too.
   What do you want with me? I bet it's
gonna be some stupid negotiation!
 Hee hee! Then I'm not going back home!
 Awwwww... you're so cute!
  W-Waaaaah! I'm getting caught up in
a crime...
 W-Waaaaah! You seem cold, for some
reason...
   Huh? Me? Hee hee! Let's negotiate!
 Huh... So you think so too, mister.
That's not it? I see...
That's unfortunate...
  You want me to jump in there? Hee hee!
 ...That's a lie! I won't fall for it!
  W-Waaaaah! You're going to kill me, huh?
Noooo... I don't wanna die!
   I heard Ⴉ slaughters any demon
he meets... That's a lie, right?
They mean someone else, right?
 Huh... I envy your self-confidence...
  Hey! You're forgetting to add "totally"!
   Hee hee! If you get angry, your blood
pressure's gonna rise!
   Hee hee! It's 'cause it's just how you
wanted it, mister!
  ...Things aren't getting any livelier...
   I don't really get it... but I'm scared!
W-Waaaaaah!
   I don't really get it... but I'm scared!
W-Waaaaaah!
