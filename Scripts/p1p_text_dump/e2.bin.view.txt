▶Nanjo
What's the matter? Are the school gates
closed?
▶Nanjo
If we don't hurry, visiting hours at the
hospital might end.
   ▶Mark
Ugh, it's Hamya. I hate that guy...
▶Mark
Cheese it, <FirstName>!
▶Yukino
Tch... Isn't there one decent teacher here
besides Ms. Saeko and the principal?
   ▶Vice-Principal Hanya
Who told you kids that you could go
through here?
▶Vice-Principal Hanya
If you want to get outside, the school
gates are there for a reason!
▶Vice-Principal Hanya
Our school's swarming with degenerates
like you! Ooishi is far too lenient!
▶Vice-Principal Hanya
Now get outta here! I'm going to call
a specialist and have this blocked off!
   |♂> Vice-Principal Hanya
Known as "Hamya" among the students,
who despise his extreme strictness.| 
   ▶Vice-Principal Hanya
You there! I TOLD you not to use
this place!▶Meek girl
Um... <FirstName>? You're going to the
hospital, right...?
   |♀> Yuko Himeno
Maki's friend. She works part-time to
support her family.
 ▶Yuko
Um, I hate to ask, but...
▶Yuko
Could you tell Maki I'll give back that
book next time I go visit her...?츛
▶Yuko
U-Um, thanks. I'm sorry to ask you to
go out of your way like that...
   ▶Yuko
O-Oh... Um, sorry I asked... It's okay,
don't worry about it...!
▶Yukino
<FirstName>! Don't be such an asshole!
  ▶Yuko
It was a really good book, so I wanted
to read it again before I return it...
   ▶Mark
That good, huh? What's it called?
   ▶Yuko
U-Um, "Gate to Paradise"...
 ▶Mark
Whoa, that's deep! I didn't know Maki
was into that kinda thing...
  ▶Nanjo
If you enjoyed it that much, why not
simply buy your own copy?
 ▶Yuko
W-Well... It's kind of expensive... and
my brothers and sisters need new clothes.
   ▶Yukino
Nanjo, you moron! Don't you know she
works part-time to help her family out?
  ▶Mark
Alright, well, we gotta get goin', but
we'll be sure to pass on your message!
   ▶Yuko
U-Um... Did you tell Maki...?
   ▶Yukino
Uh, sorry, not yet. But we're going soon,
promise.
▶Yukino
...Hey <FirstName>! Let's get to the
hospital already!▶Nanjo
Reiji Kido, eh...?
▶Nanjo
He keeps to himself... I feel as though
he does so deliberately.
▶Mark
That girl's supposedly got a thing
for Reiji...
▶Mark
Not that I'm jealous or anything!
▶Yukino
We don't have time to deal with this
nonsense. Let's get to the hospital.
 ▶Smitten girl
Um, there's a guy named Reiji in your
class, right?
▶Smitten girl
No matter how much I hang around your
homeroom at break or after school...
▶Smitten girl
I never see him! How am I supposed to
strike up a conversation?
▶Smitten girl
That romantic air of mystery he has...
Ooooh! But yeah...▶Nanjo
It's true that not even I think Chisato
has an especially attractive personality.
▶Nanjo
It seemed as if she was dating Yosuke to
show off as much as anything.
   ▶Mark
Yosuke's handsome and a nice guy. I hate
to admit it, but he's hard to beat!
▶Yukino
I was surprised too when Chisato started
dating Yosuke.
▶Yukino
It was so sudden... Chisato never acted
like she cared about him before.
▶Yukino
Actually, I always thought Ma--Ժ
Hey, shouldn't we get going?
 ▶Female student
Uh, isn't it time you gave up on Yosuke?
▶Female student
He obviously ran off with his girlfriend!
C'mon, it's been two months already!
  ▶Female student
Yosuke was popular with the girls,
but no one's seen him in two months.
   ▶Female student
That's a lie! That Chisato bitch
tricked him!
▶Female student
Everyone knows that girl's bad news!
   ▶Female student
Wasn't Yosuke best friends with Maki?
If you're visiting her, ask her about it!▶Nanjo
I believe I've asked this before, but
shouldn't we be going to the hospital?
   ▶Mark
Toro's got balls, man! I mean, asking
out Ayase!?
▶Mark
Dude... I wouldn't go after her in a
million years!
▶Yukino
I hate guys who see someone who's serious
about something and just make fun of it.
▶Toro
I-I had a weird dream! There was this
girl, and she was saying, "Help me..."
▶Toro
Was it a vision? Is there really a girl
waiting for me to rescue her?
▶Toro
W-Wow... that's awesome...
 |♂> Kenta Yokouchi (Nickname: Toro)
His love of food has made him physically
strong, but emotionally fragile.| 
   ▶Well-informed student
Dude, guess what I saw! Toro asked out
Ayase and got rejected on the spot!
▶Well-informed student
I hear he's still following her around,
though.
 > The lunchlady seems to have already
gone home.▶Nanjo
I'm not interested in this sort of
foolishness.
▶Mark
Guys our age tend to go for older women.
▶Yukino
Seriously, guys, the sun's going down.
Are we going to the hospital or not?
   ▶Brown-haired student
Nurse Natsumi is hot as hell! I love that
mature air she has...
 ▶Brown-haired student
Urk! P-Please... not that... I'm sorry!
I shouldn't have said anything!
 ▶Brown-haired student
Even if she's a bad cook, you could just
live off convenience store food.
   ▶Girl with braids
Oh, reaaaaally!? Then why don't you have
her pack your lunches from now on?
 ▶Girl with braids
That reminds me, I heard Nurse Natsumi
just had a breakup. I wonder why?▶Nanjo
Does this woman never stop running
her mouth...?
   ▶Mark
Hey <FirstName>, we're still going to
the hospital, right?
▶Yukino
Yuka seems like an airhead, but I think
sometimes she's working at it.
▶Resting boy
Are you guys going to the hospital on
the northeast corner of town?
▶Resting boy
It's a pretty long walk... Good luck
with that.
▶Short-haired girl
Hey, where's Ayase? Wasn't she with you?
▶Short-haired girl
She promised to go out, but she totally
ditched.
▶Short-haired girl
I'm thinking I might like, just go ahead
on my own.
▶Short-haired girl
It's really weird, though! She seemed
totally into it!
▶Short-haired girl
Ayase gets like this sometimes...
▶Short-haired girl
She acts all, like, cynical and stuff.
I don't understand that girl.▶Tamaki
Tadashi, you idiot! Why do you keep
messing up the club room!?
▶Tadashi
Laaa la laaa! I'm not listeniiiiing!
We can do whatever we want.
▶Tadashi
Sheesh, Tamaki, who pissed in your
cornflakes this morning?
   ▶Tamaki
What did you say!? I'm gonna rip this
trash off the walls right now!
  ▶Tadashi
Hey! What're you doing to my goddess!?
   ▶Tamaki
"Goddess" my ass, you pervert! You're the
perviest pervert ever to perv!
  ▶Tadashi
Arrrgh! You hag! You're a haggity hag
who hags all hagging day!
  ▶Male club member
*sigh* These two are like this every day.
I'm surprised they're not tired of it.
▶Tamaki
*gasp* *gasp* What is it? I'm a little
busy here.
 ▶Tadashi
*gasp* *gasp* Yeah? I'm kinda busy here.
 |♀> Tamaki
A transfer student who joined the Fencing
Club. She's always arguing with Tadashi.| 
   |♂> Tadashi
A lazy member of the Fencing Club who
quarrels with Tamaki every day.| 
   ▶Nanjo
Honestly, the idiots populating our
sports club... It's all a bit much.
▶Mark
What a half-ass job...
▶Mark
If you're gonna bomb a wall, you gotta
do it with more style.
 ▶Yukino
Leave 'em alone. You know how some people
are... They fight 'cause they care.
 ▶Female club member
Tamaki's a transfer student, but she's
good enough to place in tournaments.
▶Female club member
But she never wants to talk about her
last school... Did something happen?▶Nanjo
Stories about SEBEC tend to be unpleasant.
▶Nanjo
That aside, we should head to the
hospital.
 ▶Mark
The haunted mansion! Man, that takes
me back.
▶Mark
I used to go play there a lot and that
old bat--I mean my mom, got mad at me.
  ▶Yukino
Yeah, they tore that place down and put
up the SEBEC building last year.
  ▶Rumor-loving girl
Did you ever hear any of those weird
rumors about the SEBEC building?
▶Rumor-loving girl
Some people have heard moaning and seen
red eyes peering through windows...
▶Rumor-loving girl
It's supposed to be cursed since they
leveled the haunted mansion to build it.▶Nanjo
You quite enjoy idling the time away
with frivolity, don't you?
▶Nanjo
At this rate, the sun will have set
before our examinations are through.
   ▶Mark
The police station's straight north
from here, right?
   ▶Yukino
Huh. There's other trees like that one
in the infirmary...?
   ▶Male student
I saw a beautiful tree in the forest east
of the station.
▶Male student
It looked exactly like the one Nurse
Natsumi put in the infirmary.
▶Male student
I feel at peace when I look at that
tree... It's the strangest thing.▶Nanjo
We'll be preparing for our college
entrance exams soon.
▶Nanjo
Naturally, I plan to pass with top marks
and enter the college of my choice.
   ▶Mark
Hey, we're not supposed to be in here.
Let's just go to the hospital.
   ▶Yukino
You thought about what to do after grad?
College isn't in my plans.
   ▶Boy studying for entrance exams
I don't wanna go to cram school. I just
wanna stay home and sleep.
   ▶Girl studying for entrance exams
You can't! You need to study.
▶Girl studying for entrance exams
Let's go together, okay? Why don't we
meet at the subway entrance?
 ▶Boy studying for entrance exams
The subway... That's north through the
Sun Mall and all the way right, yeah?
 ▶Boy studying for entrance exams
You're supposed to be able to see your
future self when you play "Persona."
▶Boy studying for entrance exams
I wonder if I should try it... Will I
be in college this time next year?
   ▶Girl studying for entrance exams
Oh, give me a break!
▶Girl studying for entrance exams
If you have time to play that "Persona"
game, you have time to study!
▶Girl studying for entrance exams
Moron... you promised we'd go to the
same college together!▶Nanjo
You want to join the boxing club?
Well, let's get examined before that.
▶Mark
Boxing is so cool! It looks like it
would hurt, though.
 ▶Yukino
...I could lose some weight myself...
 ▶Dieting club member
I'm trying to lose weight. Even the boxing
gloves are starting to look like candy...
 ▶Dieting club member
Hey! Don't open the lockers without
permission! Our stuff's in there!▶Nanjo
I agree, archery is interesting...
But don't forget to go to the hospital.
 ▶Mark
I heard there's a bunch of bows here.
▶Mark
I think I'll borrow one and mess around
with it next time.
 ▶Yukino
Bows and arrows aren't my thing.
I prefer razor blades.
   ▶Archery club member
Archery is an intelligent, mature sport!
Don't have a bow? We'll lend you one!▶Nanjo
Yamaoka used to take me to the ballet
when I was small...
▶Nanjo
I suppose he was trying to cultivate my
aesthetic sensibilities.
 ▶Mark
I get fidgety around this stuff. C'mon,
let's go to the hospital!
   ▶Yukino
Ballet, huh...? The Nutcracker is kinda
neat, I always thought.
▶Yukino
A fun dream world the girl saw on 
Christmas Eve... *dreamy sigh*
▶Yukino
Hey, what's that look for!? I happen to
like ballet! Something wrong with that!?
  ▶Ballet club member
Did you know toe shoes are actually
really hard?
▶Ballet club member
I was pretty surprised the first time I
put on a pair.
  ▶Ballet club member
It was nice when they rebuilt the gym
and we finally got our own room.
▶Ballet club member
Back when we had to change in the
classrooms, someone could have seen us!
▶Ballet club member
Wait! Were you one of the pervs
doing that!?▶Agastya Tree
Young ones... Your presence is welcome.
 ▶Agastya Tree
Will you inscribe your story on me? 
   ▶Agastya Tree
Take care on your journey, young ones...▶Nanjo
The painting I saw of Maki's had a
strong, raw sense of emotion to it.
 ▶Mark
Yeah, Maki's an awesome artist... C'mon,
<FirstName>! Let's go to the hospital!
   ▶Yukino
I've seen one of Maki's paintings. She
won an award for her "Gate to Paradise."
   ▶Art club member
We could really use more members...
Maki's sick and Chisato's gone missing.
  ▶Art club member
Do you know those two?♂
 ▶Art club member
Well, Maki's pieces are incredible.
She's won several awards for them.
▶Art club member
Her friend Chisato isn't very good,
but she's had better luck with men.
 ▶Art club member
Ah, I see. Well, the art club's going
through a rough spot right now.
▶Art club member
I dunno, maybe this club's cursed...▶Nanjo
I don't have many ties with the gym,
of course. I suppose I can let it slide.
  ▶Mark
This place would be great for practicin'
dance moves if it had a big mirror.
▶Yukino
Can we hurry and get to the hospital yet?
 ▶Male student
The sound system's all good to go in the
new gym! The concert's gonna be bitchin'!
▶Male student
I'm gonna skip Sports Day and hole up in
the studio to practice!
  ▶Rumor-loving boy
I heard a second-year named Yosuke went
missing along with his girlfriend...
▶Rumor-loving boy
It's SEBEC's doing, if you ask me!
▶Rumor-loving boy
Huh? Proof...? It's just male intuition!▶Nanjo
Stuff and nonsense. Curses are nothing
more than superstition.
 ▶Mark
A secret shortcut...? Oh, he must mean
the hole in the wall.
▶Yukino
Looks like SEBEC's reputation is at an
all-time low.
  ▶Female student
Like, no way am I gonna walk by the
SEBEC building at night.
▶Female student
That company's been cursed ever since
they tore down the haunted mansion!
   ▶Male student
I'm hungry... I'm gonna get a snack.
▶Male student
It'll be easy if I use the secret
shortcut! You should give it a try, too!▶Nanjo
I can't discount it. Kandori is a man
who wouldn't hesitate to do such things.
 ▶Mark
Why's everyone so pissed at SEBEC?
It's just a regular company.
 ▶Yukino
I didn't know you were this interested
in rumors and gossip.
▶Yukino
Here's a hot tip: We need to get to the
hospital!
   ▶Rumor-loving boy
This "SEBEC curse" is a load of crap.
I bet they're making biological weapons.▶Nanjo
Code Breaker... Yes, I used to play that
with Yamaoka when I was small.
▶Mark
That dude got yelled at the other day for
betting on Rich Man, Poor Man in class.
   ▶Yukino
Let's ditch this gambling freak and go
to the hospital before I lose it, okay?
▶Gambling-addicted student
Gambling is a man's hobby. And bunny-
girls are a must for every casino!
▶Gambling-addicted student
Slots, blackjack, Code Breaker... *sigh*
I can't wait until I'm old enough to go.▶Nanjo
Dreams have no meaning. They're dreams,
nothing more.
  ▶Mark
A blue room... Y'know, I feel like I had
a dream like that too.
 ▶Yukino
Remember, there's a girl at the hospital
who wants to talk to you, too.
   ▶Female student
I had a weird dream. It's really been
bothering me...
 ▶Female student
Do you want to hear about it? 
▶Female student
It takes place in a blue room.
▶Female student
I can hear a piano and singing, and
there's an odd old man sitting down...
▶Female student
What do you think that means?
 ▶Female student
It was a really strange dream... like it
was hinting at something that'll happen.▶Nanjo
Snooping around is all well and good,
but let's not forget the hospital.
   ▶Mark
Looks like the principal isn't here.
She's probably at the courtyard again...
   ▶Yukino
Wow, these flowers are beautiful...
So it's true about the principal, huh?▶Nanjo
Compared to when I gave the entrance
ceremony speech for the incoming class...
▶Nanjo
It's true that the facilities here are
much nicer now.
  ▶Mark
I wish this place was even bigger...
The stage is too small for a guy like me!
  ▶Yukino
Remind me what we're doing here? Weren't
we going to get ourselves examined?
  ▶Drama club member
Much has transpired on this old stage.
▶Drama club member
Its long history has seen countless
tears, blood, and sweat shed.
▶Drama club member
Though the stage be no more, the passion
of those who stood here shall not fade...
▶Drama club member
How was that? It's a tricky speech, so it
took me a while to memorize.
 ▶Drama club member
The time has come at last... The ancient
passions cast on this stage will be free!
▶Drama club member
Just kidding! Cool line though, huh?
It's part of the script I wrote.▶Nanjo
You're all so slow... You must seize
the moment, like myself!
▶Nanjo
There's a reason it's said that one's
youth passes quickly.
  ▶Nanjo
Yes, yes, what IS it, <FirstName>!? If
you have nothing to say, away with you!
   ▶Mark
That Nanjo pisses me off so bad...
I'll find a chink in his armor someday.
  ▶Mark
"Young master"! Hah! Did you hear that?
He's a young master!
▶Mark
Teeheehee... This is perfect!
   ▶Yukino
Masao and Kei are both such children.
 ▶Yukino
That Yamaoka guy must really love Nanjo.
  ▶Male student
There was a weird old guy waiting by the
gates a little earlier. Pretty creepy...
   ▶Female student
Hey, isn't Nanjo kinda scary? He's gone
past "cool" straight on to "cold."
▶Male student
Yo, <FirstName>! I heard you collapsed!
▶Male student
Are you studying too much, man?
Haha, like that'd happen...!▶Nanjo
There's nothing much of interest here.
 ▶Mark
This mat's really comfy.
▶Yukino
It's so dusty and sweaty... How can
people actually sleep here?▶Agastya Tree

What do you kids want?
▶Stern-faced man
This ain't a playground for brats like
you. Hey, toss these kids out!
   ▶Man's voice
Takeda? What's this disturbance about?
   ▶Nanjo
Kandori...!
▶Kandori
My, what a rare pleasure.
▶Kandori
What business does the scion of the
Nanjo family have with us?
   ▶Nanjo
I didn't come here for you. I'm only
tagging along with these people.
  ▶Kandori
Aha... Then these must be the young
master's school friends.
▶Kandori
You accompanied them to a sordid place
like this? Quite a friendship indeed...
▶Nanjo
Cease calling me "young master." I never
gave you permission to use that name.
 ▶Takeda
You little--!
 ▶Kandori
Stand down, Takeda. It seems the Nanjo
family lacks discipline...
▶Kandori
Well, I'll allow it.
▶Kandori
But Nanjo... I will teach you the proper
form of address to your betters.
 ▶Mark
Nanjo's an insufferable dick, but you're
a hell of a lot worse...!
  ▶Takeda
Tch... It's almost time, Mr. Kandori.
 ▶Kandori
Yes, I'll be right there.
▶Kandori
Now then, the time has come for me to
ask you all to leave.
  ▶Mark
Heh! Let's go, <FirstName>.
   ▶Man
Excuse me, do you have an appointment?
▶Man
I'm sorry, but if you don't have one,
I must ask you to leave.
  |♂> Takeda
Kandori's right-hand man who carries
out SEBEC's illegal operations.| 
 |♂> Takahisa Kandori
The ambitious branch president of SEBEC.
Sinister rumors circulate about him...| ▶Kaneda
What do YOU children want? You'd better
not be here to steal my treasure!
 |♀> Katsue Kaneda
A resident of Mikage-cho who seems to
be living the high life lately.| 
 ▶Nanjo
What nonsense!
▶Nanjo
To my eyes, this old woman's so-called
"treasure" is little more than rubbish.
▶Nanjo
She purports to be an antique collector...
▶Nanjo
But she'll buy anything that's priced
high enough. What could be more absurd?
 ▶Yukino
That old biddy treats everyone like
a thief. Just ignore her.
 ▶Mark
Can we leave yet, <FirstName>? I'm sick
of taking her crap!
   ▶Kaneda
Hmph! Children like you can't grasp my
treasure's true worth!
▶Kaneda
Now get out of my sight!
   ▶Kaneda
What are the police doing!? I pay more
taxes than anyone else!
▶Kaneda
Shouldn't they come protect me first at
times like these?
▶Kaneda
If anything happens to my treasure,
I'll sue!
  ▶Elly
But everyone pays taxes. There's no
call to boast about it.
 ▶Kaneda
Don't act like such a know-it-all, missy!
Ugh, hurry up and get off my property!▶Nanjo
Masao seems to be acquainted with these
officers...
▶Nanjo
Though he doesn't appear to be
particularly happy to see them.
 ▶Mark
Yeah, well... sorta...
  ▶Mark
Geez, <FirstName>! What'd you gotta bring
me to the police station for!?
  ▶Yukino
Hah, that look on Mark's face...
priceless. But uh... the hospital...?
▶Lieutenant
Well, if it isn't Masao. You've been
attending school, I hope?
▶Lieutenant
Not causing trouble for your teachers,
are you?
   ▶Lieutenant
I'm the one who set him straight...
I feel somewhat responsible for him now.
  ▶Female officer
That's a little harsh, Lieutenant.
You're no trouble anymore, right Masao?
▶Female officer
You must be Masao's friend. He's a nice
boy, don't you think? I like him.▶Agastya Tree

The historical society seems to be past
here. Are we going inside?
 ▶Mark
Mmmm... receptionists. Er, uh...
▶Yukino
You're doing social studies research
before we go to the hospital?
▶Yukino
Whatever, weirdo...
   ▶Receptionist
Welcome to the Mikage Historical Society!
▶Receptionist
We have many interesting exhibits here
that shed light on the area's history.▶Nanjo
It's long been said that mirrors have
mystical powers... Is this one of them?
  ▶Mark
You're awfully studious all of a sudden.
Is Hell about to freeze over?
  ▶Yukino
It's musty in here, but kinda nice.
Maybe it's the mirror's influence.
▶Man
I came to see the |ԏExpel Mirror|  display.
It's as divine as they say...
▶Girl
The Expel Mirror was all they found in
the ruins six months ago.

ruins 'cause there's nothing else there.▶Agastya Tree

Hey, Massie! You came just in time!
▶Mark's mother
I'm doing some shopping, but the load's
piling up. Help me out, Massie!
▶Nanjo
Hmmmm... This "Massie" is you, is it,
Masao Inaba...?
  ▶Mark
Q-Quit it, you old bat! I'm busy!
Leave me alone!
   ▶Mark's mother
Massie! You'd call your own mother an
old bat!?
▶Mark's mother
And just when I was thinking of buying
you some t-shirts!
  ▶Yukino
"Massie"? That's about as embarrassing
as "young master."
 ▶Mark
No one asked you, Yukino!
   ▶Mark's mother
Oh, are these your friends? My, this store
is expensive. Look at this one, Massie!
 ▶Mark
What do I want with that!? C'mon,
<FirstName>, let's go!
  ▶Mark's mother
Honestly, that boy... I hope you'll all
stand by Massie, won't you?
  ▶Mark
She can't still be here... Ԟright...?
  ▶Mark's mother
Oh, Massie, you're back! Perfect timing!
   ▶Mark
Crap! ԞShe's still here!? Let's ditch
this place, <FirstName>!
   ▶Mark's mother
Massie!
▶Mark
Oh, crap! It's my mom!▶Mark
Hey... Is anyone here...?
   ▶Mark
You're hiding around here someplace,
right? It's me, Masao. I'm not a demon.
▶Mark
It's safe... You can come out...
We'll take you home.
   ▶Mark
Mom...?
 ▶Mark
Eh, it's nothin', <FirstName>. I'm fine.
▶Mark
The old bat must've gone home before
it all went down.
▶Mark
I bet she's bawlin' over her "stories"
on TV as we speak.
▶Mark
C'mon, let's go!
   > No one seems to be here...▶Clerk
Oh, you're early, Yukino. Doesn't your
shift start later? Do you need something?
   ▶Yukino
Something's come up, so I'll be in late.
I'll work overtime to make it up.
▶Clerk
Oh, okay. You're a real go-getter, y'know
that? I guess you have a reason to work.
 ▶Nanjo
I can't fathom Yukino wearing that
uniform and smiling at customers.
   ▶Nanjo
It's quite impressive that this place is
still open in the midst of a demon attack.
▶Mark
Yukino really does have a part-time job?
Uh... why?
 ▶Mark
Looks like the demons aren't comin' into
the store. That's a relief...
  ▶Yukino
I want to study photography abroad,
so I gotta save up.
   ▶Yukino
I wonder if I should've said that...
I can't guarantee they won't come in.
▶Clerk
Welcome! What would you like?
  ▶Elly
What a curious feeling... It's as if
everything is all a dream when I'm here.
   ▶Clerk
Y-Yukino! Some monsters showed up!
Um, could you please stay with me here?
 ▶Yukino
I'm really sorry, but there's somewhere
I need to go.
▶Yukino
But I'm pretty sure you'll be fine as
long as you stay in the store.
   ▶Clerk
I'll be okay if I'm here... Gotta keep
the store open... We never close...
▶Clerk
Welcome!▶Nanjo
I'd think life in Shibuya would be rather
noisy. This girl evidently has no idea...
▶Mark
I wish I could leave my crappy home...
I'm too embarrassed to have friends over.
▶Yukino
That girl's a friend of Yuka's. They're
a lot alike... neither ever shuts up.
 ▶Girl
I can't wait to live on my own! I'm
thinking I'll get a place by Shibuya...
▶Girl
Sounds awesome. Ugh, I can't wait to
ditch this boring place.
▶Smiling clerk
Welcome to Peace Diner, where we always
give you double meat!
  ▶Yukino
Hey! Now's not the time to chow down
on fast food!▶Nanjo
A card game? Mm... I'll let it slide.
It sounds adult enough.
▶Nanjo
Whereas Masao still gets excited over
video games, even in high school.
▶Nanjo
...Don't tell me you still play those
things, too?
   ▶Mark
Aw, crap...
▶Mark
I'm broke! Man, what a shame... Heheh.
▶Mark
Sorry, guess we'll have to do all-you-
can-eat some other time!
▶Mark
Hidehiko's not here, is he? Good...
▶Mark
Dammit... I never shoulda said anything
about all-you-can-eat!
   ▶Yukino
Summoning demons...
▶Yukino
I don't think it'd be anything to joke
about if it actually happened.
▶Game-loving man
Right now, I'm into this card game
called "Persona"...
▶Game-loving man
You use these things called "Spell Cards"
to summon demons.
▶Game-loving man
Man, can you imagine if you could really
do that? Wouldn't it be wild?
▶Clerk
Welcome--Crap, the register's on
the fritz.
▶Clerk
What do I do with this? I don't know
how to fix this thing!▶Agastya Tree
Young ones... Your presence is welcome.
 ▶Agastya Tree
Will you inscribe your story on me? 
   ▶Agastya Tree
Take care on your journey, young ones...▶Nanjo
True, we could get checked out here...
But aren't we on the way to the hospital?
   ▶Nanjo
... Oh, sorry, <FirstName>. I was just
lost in thought.
 ▶Mark
This is kind of a pain.
 ▶Mark
Maki's mom is at the shrine, right?
We should hurry and go get her.
 ▶Mark
So Kandori was behind it all... Are we
still goin' to the abandoned factory?
  ▶Yukino
Never been to the doctor before...
Sent a couple people there, though.
  ▶Yukino
Don't sweat it too much, <FirstName>.
We're here for you.
   ▶Elly
This clinic's cheerful atmosphere is
always relaxing, I find.
   ▶Nurse
We just had the clinic remodeled, too!
Doesn't it look nice?
   ▶Nurse
I hear things are going haywire outside.
If I wasn't on the job, I'd go look!▶Doctor
You must go to St. Hermelin. I heard
they finished building the new gym.
▶Doctor
Must be easier to use than the old
one, huh?
▶Doctor
Wish I could find a nurse who was less
of a ditz.
 ▶Doctor
Now, what can I do for you?ԙ
 ▶Doctor
Alright... For all of you together...
 ▶Doctor
My fee is ৎ00 yen. Well? 
▶Doctor
Hm. Then let's get you patched up.
▶Doctor
There, that should do it.
▶Doctor
Anything else you need? 
   ▶Doctor
Well, I can't treat patients who can't
pay. Come back when you have the fee.
  ▶Doctor
I hope you don't run into trouble later
because you cheaped out on treatment.
 ▶Doctor
All right. If anything else comes up,
I recommend you see me immediately.
 ▶Doctor
My time is valuable. If you don't have
any business here, then take a hike.▶Nanjo
I've never eaten sweets before.
Yamaoka wouldn't allow it.
 ▶Nanjo
That clerk seems to be suspicious of us.
▶Nanjo
But ARE we really still human now that we
have this power? What do you think?
 ▶Mark
I wonder if kids still come to places
like this nowadays.
▶Mark
I used to come here every day to play
the raffle!
  ▶Mark
I wish I could be as laid back as you,
<FirstName>.
   ▶Yukino
Coming here once in a while is fine, but
did you forget about the hospital?
   ▶Yukino
I'm worried about the school... For some
reason, I'm real nervous about it.
   ▶Elly
I'm rather surprised that some people
can remain calm. It's very impressive.
▶Storekeeper
One bite of Sennen Mannen-Do's sweets
extends your life by 1,000 years...
▶Storekeeper
A second bite gives you 10,000 years.
Would you like one?
▶Storekeeper
Are you... truly human? Well, if you're
a customer, I welcome you.▶Nanjo
...paralyzed, then Dis-Para does the
trick...
▶Nanjo
Augh! The song won't leave my brain!
 ▶Nanjo
A well-prepared man fears nothing!
...That's what Yamaoka always said.
 ▶Mark
Don't tell me you're buying painkillers...
We gotta go to the hospital!
 ▶Mark
When I left my house this morning,
I sure wasn't expecting this.
▶Yukino
That lady sure seems to like getting
into other people's business.
▶Yukino
I wonder how Maki's mom is doing...
Hope she wasn't hurt too bad.
 ▶Elly
You get to the shrine by going south
past the shopping district.
▶Elly
Head straight east at the dead end and
you'll find yourself there.
  ▶Clerk
Oh, you go to St. Hermelin? Do you know
my son Tadashi?
▶Clerk
He's a hopeless slacker, but he's fallen
in love with a real cutie!
▶Clerk
I'd be over the moon if a girl like that
married my boy!
▶Clerk
Hm...? Oh, right, medicine.
Coming right up!
  ▶Clerk
Ah, welcome!
▶Clerk
Hey, have you seen Tamaki?
▶Clerk
I'm really worried about her...
▶Clerk
My son, on the other hand, can take
a running jump!
▶Clerk
Hm...? Oh, right, medicine.
Coming right up!
   ▶Rumor-loving housewife
Hey, don't you think it's weird, too?
I mean that Kaneda!
▶Rumor-loving housewife
In the space of only a year, she's
struck it rich somehow!
▶Rumor-loving housewife
It's suspicious, if you ask me...
Veeeery suspicious!
  ▶Clerk
Hmm? You're looking for my son? I think
that numbskull's at his club right now.
▶Clerk
*sigh* I wish I could have an argument
with Tamaki at least once...
▶Clerk
Hmm? Hey, the counter is over here!▶Nanjo
I wasn't aware you were a gambler. Looks
can evidently be deceiving.
   ▶Nanjo
You don't seem to have a care in the
world...
▶Nanjo
I'm rather envious of your composure at
a time like this.
▶Mark
Elly's pretty well-known, huh?
▶Mark
But then again, it's not that surprising.
She's pretty awesome.
   ▶Mark
I like casinos too, but right now I
just wanna hit up the shrine.
   ▶Yukino
Do what you want, but can it wait until
after we've been to the hospital?
 ▶Yukino
I'm amazed at Eriko's guts. But then,
with her looks, she needs 'em.
  ▶Elly
Men like him are so tedious...
  ▶Clerk
Hiiii! SO nice to see you!
▶Clerk
If you're looking to exchange money for
coins, I'm your man.
▶Clerk
Won't you purchase some coins? Hmmmm? 
 ▶Clerk
I can exchange your coins for items, if
that's what you're in the mood for...
▶Clerk
Wanna see what I've got? 
▶Flirtatious man
Hey, do you all go to St. Hermelin?
Then you must know that girl...
▶Flirtatious man
She has long hair and a knockout figure.
I think her name's Sally or Mary...
▶Firtatious man
Whatever it is, she's gorgeous! C'mon,
next time she's here, introduce us!
   ▶Flirtatious man
Hey, I've been looking for you. You can't
be out and about like this!
▶Flirtatious man
Aren't you scared with all the demons
around? C'mon, let me protect you!
 ▶Elly
Well, that's very generous of you.
▶Elly
But given how much more extensive my
knowledge of demons is than yours...
▶Elly
...Not to mention my ability to protect
myself... Bother  someone  else.
   ▶Flirtatious man
Uh... ԞO-Okay...
▶Flirtatious man
That girl Elly isn't with you? Aww, I
was gonna show her how tough I am...
   ▶Flirtatious man
Well, that was a bust. But she'll need
someone to protect her sooner or later!
▶Flirtatious man
I'll just keep trying until then!

 In this version of poker, you can
change your hand once.
You will be dealt five cards at the
outset.
Use the directional buttons to move to
a card, and press the íȺႨȺùȺࠁ buttons
to hold that card.
Once you have chosen which cards to
hold, press the R button to re-draw
the remaining cards.
If you have a valid hand after the
second draw, you win.
The higher the bet, the larger the
payout for a winning hand will be.
If you win, you can bet the amount
you just won on an Extra Game.
If you'd rather not risk it, choose
"Take Winnings."
There are three types of Extra Game.
Each round you win doubles your
earnings.
By winning the Extra Game, you can
wager up to 1,000,000 coins.
But be careful; one mistake and you'll
lose it all.
<Extra Game 1>
ٰHigh & Low
One card is shown, with four other
cards left face-down.
You must guess which face-down card is
higher than the shown card.
If the card you draw has the same
number as the shown card, the game is
a draw and you may try again.
<Extra Game 2>
ٰBig & Small
One card is shown and one card is
face-down.
You must guess whether the face-down
card is bigger or smaller than the
shown card.
If both cards are equal, you lose,
so be careful.
<Extra Game 3>
ٰRed & Black
One face-down card is dealt.
If you think it's ॵ or ࣚ, choose Red.
If you think it's ਏ or ࢼ, choose Black.
If the color you chose matches the
card's color, you win.

   > It's a video blackjack machine.

 This is a one-on-one-game of blackjack
against the dealer.
The computer acts as the dealer.
Two cards are dealt to the player and
the dealer at the outset.
One of the dealer's two cards will be
kept face-down.
If the dealer's shown card is an ace,
you may place an insurance bet.
The insurance mechanic will be explained
at the end of these rules.
First, compare your cards to the dealer's
to decide whether to draw another card.
If you decide to draw, select Hit.
If not, select Stand.
You may draw up to 7 cards as long as
their total value remains 21 or lower.
The following circumstances will result
in an automatic Stand:
-Your initial draw is blackjack.
-The total of the cards drawn after
Hitting is 21.
-You draw seven cards.
-The cards' total value surpasses 21,
resulting in a bust.
2 through 10 are face value. J through
K are worth 10, and A is worth either
1 or 11.
After the player Stands, the dealer
will draw cards.
If your total is larger than the
dealer's without surpassing 21...
Or if the dealer busts, you win.
If you and the dealer tie, or if both
of you have blackjack, it is a draw,
and your bet will be returned to you.
Besides Hit and Stand, the player can
also choose to Double Down or Split.
 <D. Down> 
This is only an option while you still
have two cards in your hand.
You may double your bet under the
condition that you only Hit once.
This option will be unavailable if you
have fewer coins than the bet would be.
If you Double Down and beat the dealer,
your winnings will be doubled.
<Split>
You may Split if both of your initial
cards are the same value.
Your hand will be split, with a second
bet covering the other hand.
This option will be unavailable if you
have fewer coins than the bet would be.
Even after a Split, you may Double Down
on either or both hands.
However, if you split, even with a
combination of A with 10 through K...
It will be counted as 21 without being
considered blackjack.

ႬAbout insuranceႭ
An insurance bet is much as it sounds...
It can only be placed if the dealer's
first card is an ace.
Select Yes to place an insurance bet,
and No to decline.
If you select No, the game progresses
normally.
If you select Yes, you must first
pay half your bet as insurance.
If the dealer's second card is 10
through K, forming blackjack...
The initial bet is forfeited.
However...
The insurance bet will pay out at
3 to 1, and the game will end.
If the dealer's card is A through 9,
the insurance is lost and the game
progresses normally.
Since Ⴤ decks of cards are used in this
game, there is a chance that two or more
identical cards will be dealt.

 Winning the game:
If your hand is larger than the dealer's
without going over 21...
Or if the dealer busts, you win.
Blackjack:
An A combined with a second card of
10 through K. (Automatically Stands.)
If you chose to Split, this will not
be counted as blackjack but is 21.
6 Cards:
If you choose Stand when you've drawn
six cards without surpassing 21.
7 Cards:
If you've drawn seven cards without
surpassing 21. (Automatically Stands.)

The closer the roll is to 7, the lower
the multiplier. This is because rolls
close to 7 appear more frequently.
Thus, the safe bet is on rolls close
to 7, with rolls like 2 and 12 being
riskier.
In the Extra Game, if a roll of 7
comes up, you lose all your winnings.

  ▶Elly
Let's go to the Alaya Shrine once we're
fixed up. It's just around the corner.
  ▶Elly
Once our wounds are treated, let's hurry
to the abandoned factory.
▶Elly
Though do you really think it's possible
to access SEBEC from there?
  ▶Nurse
My, does that uniform bring back memories!
I'm a St. Hermelin grad myself.
▶Nurse
One of my old classmates, Saeko Takami,
teaches there now. Do you know her?
▶Nurse
Haha, that Saeko... I never pictured
her as a teacher!
  ▶Nurse
I heard an injured woman was walking
around here. Did the demons get her...?▶Doctor
Well, hello there. Your friends are...
interesting as always.
 ▶Doctor
Now, what can I do for you?ԙ
 ▶Doctor
Alright... For all of you together...
 ▶Doctor
My fee is ৎ00 yen. Well? 
▶Doctor
Hm. Then let's get you patched up.
▶Doctor
There, that should do it.
▶Doctor
Anything else you need?
 
  ▶Doctor
Well, I can't treat patients who can't
pay. Come back when you have the fee.
  ▶Doctor
I hope you don't run into trouble later
because you cheaped out on treatment.
 ▶Doctor
All right. If anything else comes up,
I recommend you see me immediately.
 ▶Doctor
My time is valuable. If you don't have
any business here, then take a hike.▶Nanjo
I can't speak to what went on at the
haunted mansion; I've never been.
 ▶Nanjo
It would be nice if I could someday cure
my wounds through willpower alone.
▶Mark
The "haunted mansion" was just some old,
abandoned dump. We liked it there, is all.
 ▶Mark
It's so quiet here... I feel like
nothin' ever happened.
▶Yukino
I'll admit, I played at the haunted
mansion too.
  ▶Yukino
Whatever's out there in town... 
It's not a bear, is it?
 ▶Elly
I wonder... what prompted the sudden
appearance of these demons?
▶Nurse
Did you play in the haunted mansion when
you were little? Lots of kids did.
▶Nurse
I heard a bear appeared. Was it brown?
White? Plump and hairy?▶Doctor
It's another nice day out.
▶Doctor
Do bears appear even in this town...?
 ▶Doctor
Now, what can I do for you?ԙ
 ▶Doctor
Alright... For all of you together...
 ▶Doctor
My fee is 1,000 yen. Well? 
  ▶Doctor
Hm. Then let's get you patched up.
▶Doctor
There, that should do it.
▶Doctor
Anything else you need? 
   ▶Doctor
Well, I can't treat patients who can't
pay. Come back when you have the fee.
  ▶Doctor
I hope you don't run into trouble later
because you cheaped out on treatment.
 ▶Doctor
All right. If anything else comes up,
I recommend you see me immediately.
 ▶Doctor
My time is valuable. If you don't have
any business here, then take a hike.▶Nanjo
The only clothing I require is this
uniform... and my scarf, of course.
▶Mark
Speaking of clothes, what's with Nanjo's
scarf? He's always wearing that thing.
 ▶Yukino
Tch, did Yuka ask you to go shopping
for her?
▶Yukino
Well, once you're done here, we're going
straight to the hospital!
 ▶Clerk
The people in this town have such bad
fashion sense!
▶Clerk
The only one with a shred of taste is
this brown-haired boy I see sometimes...
▶Clerk
He's got these cool goggles on, and he's
really cute!▶Nanjo
Well then, where to next? We can go
anywhere you please...
▶Nanjo
Just so long as the hospital is in our
plans at some point.
 ▶Nanjo
So he refuses to close his business even
with the advent of demons...
▶Nanjo
The common people can be stronger-willed
than I had given them credit for.
   ▶Mark
Music...? Like, pianos and singing?
▶Mark
Huh? I think I've heard somethin' like
that somewhere too...
 ▶Mark
Is it okay, these stores bein' open?
▶Mark
I ain't responsible if they get messed
up by demons!
▶Elly
That reminds me, some people at school
were saying something similar.
   ▶Yukino
A weird store? What do you think's
in it...?
  ▶Yukino
Haven't you had enough fooling around?
Can we go to the Alaya Shrine next?
▶Clerk
My, I'm grateful you came all this way.
Well, feel free to look around.
▶Clerk
My, I'm grateful you came all this way.
Things must be hard for all of you.
▶Customer
There's this one strange store in this
here mall...
▶Customer
Whenever I go take a gander, it's closed,
and I've never seen anyone go in or out.
▶Customer
But every now and then, you can hear
music from in there...
▶Customer
It's a funny old world, isn't it?
   ▶Customer
That strange store in this mall will
apparently be open soon.
▶Customer
Don't ask me when, though.▶Atastya Tree
Young ones... Your presence is welcome.
 ▶Atastya Tree
Will you inscribe your story on me? 
   ▶Atastya Tree
Take care on your journey, young ones...▶Nanjo
...when you're feeling ill, then just
take a Dis-Sick...
▶Nanjo
Gah, this insidious song! I'm being
brainwashed!
  ▶Nanjo
All one can trust is one's own strength.
It's the only way.
▶Mark
So this is Tadashi's uncle's store.
He said he lives at the Sun Mall one?
   ▶Mark
Kids these days sure know what's what...
▶Yukino
I'm curious about this tree that wasn't
there before.
 ▶Yukino
I'm surprised Maki's mom made it to
the shrine.
▶Yukino
If she'd collapsed before then... I don't
like to think what might've happened.
  ▶Elly
I'm giving some thought to the mystery
as well.
▶Elly
This is my chance to put into practice
the things I've studied all this time.
▶Clerk
Are you friends with my nephew? Then I'll
give you extra special service!
  ▶Clerk
I'm not the least bit scared of demons.
▶Clerk
I'm sure it was just a trick, or maybe
I was seeing things.
▶Customer
I went to the park and saw a tree that
wasn't there before. You should go look.
 ▶Clerk
You can't go in there! It's private!
   ▶Customer
The TV and radio don't work, and my
parents are hiding under their futons.
▶Customer
I guess in the end, you have to take
matters into your own hands.▶Bizarre-looking man
My name is Igor... I am delighted to
make your acquaintance.
▶Igor
This place exists between dream and
reality, mind and matter...
▶Igor
It's been quite some time since we last
had a guest.
▶Igor
This is a room that only those bound by
a "contract" may enter...
▶Igor
From this day forth, you will be our
guest in this Velvet Room.
▶Igor
Your destiny will require you to hone
your power...
▶Igor
And for that, you will inevitably
require our help.
▶Igor
The Velvet Room is also known as the
room of Personas.
▶Igor
A Persona is a side of you that shows
itself when you face the world...
▶Igor
Think of it as a facade of protection
you wear to face hardships in life.
▶Igor
Hm... Perhaps that may have been rather
difficult to understand...
▶Igor
To battle opponents that cannot be
dealt with by human strength alone...
▶Igor
We in this room will lend you inhuman
power... The power of demons...
▶Igor
Now then. Allow me to explain my role
here...
▶Igor
I will assist you in giving birth to
new Personas.
▶Igor
The demons contained within the |ԏspell
cards|  you hold will be fused as one...
▶Igor
Thereby creating a new Persona.
▶Igor
Should you find yourselves with these
cards, please do bring them here.
  ▶Igor
Welcome to the Velvet Room...
   ▶Igor
What is it you desire?
▶Igor
Well then, what would you like
to know?Ԡ
   ▶Igor
I'm afraid you don't have enough |ԏspell
cards|  to give birth to a new Persona.
▶Igor
Alas, we cannot look after any more
Personas.
   ▶Igor
What would you like to do?Ԟ
▶Igor
Well then... Farewell...
▶Igor
If it's new Personas you want, I shall
fuse and create them for you.
▶Igor
First, though, I must summon demons to
fuse together into a Persona.
▶Igor
And for that, a certain type of card
is necessary.
▶Igor
You see, these cards are inscribed with
demon-summoning spells.
▶Igor
They are known as spell cards, and all
demons carry one.
▶Igor
Thus, in order to perform a fusion, I
will need you to gather spell cards.
▶Igor
Go forth, negotiate with demons,
and bring these spell cards back here.
▶Igor
Combat is not the only way to deal
with demons... Do you understand?
▶Igor
And not all demons are necessarily
wishing for a fight...
 ▶Igor
It isn't enough merely to fuse a new
Persona in order to make it your own...
▶Igor
There is rather more to it than that,
I'm afraid.
▶Igor
You must take a Persona onto yourself
in order to use its power.
▶Igor
Each of you is capable of holding up
to three Personas.
▶Igor
A newly-fused Persona will be entrusted
into my care.
▶Igor
By all means let me know when you
would like to take on new Personas.
▶Igor
But I can only look after 16 Personas
at a time, mind you.
▶Igor
There are as many Personas as there are
personalities... an infinite variety.
▶Igor
Each has its own form and substance,
to be used according to the situation.
▶Igor
If you can master that principle,
you will make a fine Persona-user.
▶Igor
Each of you can take on as many as
three Personas at once.
▶Igor
Of the three, only one can be actively
invoked during battle.
▶Igor
To invoke a Persona is to summon it
in combat.
▶Igor
The remaining two will remain on
standby...
▶Igor
Ready to be assumed at any time
during battle.
▶Igor
Different active Personas will grant
you different abilities.
▶Igor
Without the power of Persona, you are
no different than an ordinary human...
▶Igor
You will be powerless before the arcane
might of the demons' spells.
▶Igor
If by chance you were hit by a spell in
that state, you would be struck down.
▶Igor
But by taking on a Persona, your defense
against spells is considerably enhanced.
▶Igor
For some, it may also confer strength,
or increase luck for others.
▶Igor
This, too, is the power of Persona.
▶Igor
Though they are called Personas, each
is a hidden side of yourself.
▶Igor
I suggest you examine your status
carefully after assuming one.
▶Igor
That way, you can see which of your
qualities have changed.
▶Igor
At first, you will be unable to harness
your Persona's powers to the fullest.
▶Igor
But the more you invoke a Persona,
the more powers it will grant you.
▶Igor
As your Persona learns new skills, you
will have more options in battle.
▶Igor
Even if your Persona learns a powerful
skill, the SP required remains constant.
▶Igor
You will grow in combat, but do not
forget that your Personas grow as well.
▶Igor
Pardon me for being nosy, but...
▶Igor
Personas have eight levels of growth.
You should try to develop them fully.
▶Igor
I'm sure that there will be an ample
reward for doing so...
▶Igor
You might also be interested to know
about various factors in fusion.
▶Igor
For example, even when creating the
same Persona...
▶Igor
The combination of spell cards, the
affinities of the demons used...
▶Igor
The position of Terra and Luna, and any
essences added into the mix...
▶Igor
All of these factor into the resultant
Persona. And one more thing...
▶Igor
You may also add an item into the
fusion to trigger a change.
▶Igor
There are some items for which the
result is easily predictable...
▶Igor
But sometimes, even I will be unable
to guess at what may happen.
▶Igor
Should that come about, I do hope that
you'll pardon me.
▶Igor
But make no mistake, I do believe it
is worth trying...
▶Igor
I suggest gems for obtaining a higher-
or lower-ranked fusion within an order.
▶Igor
As for the other items' effects, you
should experiment for yourself.▶Nanjo
Is no one home? Hmm... What an
extraordinarily small house.
▶Mark
Well, yeah, anyplace would look small
next to yours!
▶Mark
Tch, this is why I can't stand rich
dudes like you...
   ▶Yukino
I think this is where Yuko Himeno lives.
You know, Maki's friend.
▶Yukino
I work part-time for myself, but she's
doing it for her family...
  ▶Mark
Man... talk about a sob story!
  ▶Mark
Yo Nanjo, why don't you work part-time
to pay Yamaoka's salary yourself!?
   ▶Yukino
Looks like Yuko isn't home yet.▶Bizarre-looking man

Does that old man really believe such,
or is he toying with us...?
 ▶Mark
Man, what's with him calling you Hiroshi?
   ▶Yukino
It must be rough on the nurse.
▶Old man
Look, Akiko, Hiroshi came to visit.
  ▶Nurse
That's right. Hiroshi's here...
▶Old man
Thanks for coming all this way, Hiroshi.
 > Listen to the old man?Ԕ
 ▶Old man
Now you listen here, Hiroshi. A man's
soul is a complex thing.
▶Old man
The things a person shows to the outside
world isn't necessarily what he thinks.
▶Old man
You have to dig deep to find out the
truth they're hiding...
 ▶Old man
I see. I'm glad to hear you're enjoying
school.
  ▶Nurse
Hiroshi seems to be his grandson.
He mistakes me for his daughter, too...▶Nurse
Hm? Aren't you Maki Sonomura's friend?
 ▶Mark
Uh...
   ▶Nurse
You visited her last week too didn't you?
And the week before...
   ▶Nanjo
Is that so...? You're unexpectedly
nice to her, I see.
 ▶Yukino
Leave him alone, Nanjo.▶Nanjo
There aren't many at this hospital whom
Maki could converse with.
▶Nanjo
Small wonder she doesn't feel like
leaving her room, if that's the case...
   ▶Mark
Maki's room is the second one, straight
down from here.
 ▶Yukino
It was a good call, coming here. I'm sure
Maki will be glad to see us.
▶Patient
A high school girl? Hmm... I've never
seen her, I don't think.
▶Patient
She's probably cooped up in her room...
It'd do her good to get out sometimes.
  ▶Patient
There's a girl on this floor who looked
like she was in high school...
▶Patient
But sometimes I hear a little girl's
voice from her room.
▶Patient
There's only one bed in there... Does she
have a sister or someone visiting her?▶Nanjo
Why is Maki's mother working at THAT
company, of all places!?
  ▶Mark
Oh, crap! Y'think I should've brought
flowers or something?

Well, too late now!

C'mon, Maki's waiting.
▶Nurse
Are you Maki's friends? I'm glad you came.
▶Nurse
You know she's been in and out of the
hospital since she was a child, right?
▶Nurse
I always worried about her keeping up
her friendships...
   ▶Nurse
I can hardly believe it!

Her only daughter is in the hospital and
she hasn't visited even once!

I don't care how busy she is at SEBEC!

Oh my, please excuse me...

What is this bullshit!? Whoever's doing
this is gonna pay!

I'll get this place back to normal or
die trying!

There's a patient in there!

I have to treat the Sonomura girl...!
   ▶Nurse

dead too! What in the world is going on!?

I'd treat your wounds at the examination
room, but... I can't find it!

remember it!▶Nanjo
...I'm sorry, <FirstName>. I'm not
thinking as quickly as usual.

Dammit! If only we had a hint or
something!
 ▶Elly
I want to help Maki's mother right away.
Please come with me to the Alaya Shrine!
   ▶Yukino
It's like even the air's changed...
I'm finding it hard to breathe.
   ▶Nurse
There's a strange haze I can see through
the window... It's covering the town.
▶Nurse
You don't think we're trapped here like
in the horror novels, do you?
   ▶Old man
Oh, hello again, Hiroshi! Did you come
to listen to my stories?
▶Old man
I have something to say that I think
you may need to hear.
▶Old man
Stay calm, and think carefully before
making a move.
▶Old man
If you do... you'll arrive at the truth
come what may.
▶Old man
Say, Akiko? Is lunch ready yet?▶Nanjo
I'll figure this out... There's nothing
I can't do if I put my mind to it!
 ▶Mark
Hey, you think the other guys have
this power too?
  ▶Elly
We need to go to the Alaya Shrine.
Please don't forget!
 ▶Yukino
This power's kinda unnerving, but it
looks like it'll come in handy.
  ▶Patient
Argh, my cavity's hurting again.
▶Patient
How can I get it treated when I can't
reach the dentistry ward!?
  ▶Patient
I'm prepared for the worst, but I'm
worried about my little grandson...
▶Patient
He should be at school... I hope
nothing's happened there.▶Nanjo
...ԺHm? Yes, what is it?
  ▶Mark
I wonder if there are other patients
besides Maki in trouble right now...
   ▶Elly
I'm concerned about Maki's mother's
condition. Let's hurry to the shrine!
 ▶Yukino
I always thought you were a pushover,
<FirstName>...
▶Yukino
I'm surprised how calm you are.
   ▶Nurse
I can't get in touch with the patients!
What am I supposed to do?
▶Nurse
Can't you do something!? ...I'm sorry.
I'm asking the impossible.
▶Nurse
I'm just so confused...▶Doctor
Are you all right? Here, let me take

It's quite impressive that this place is
still open in the midst of a demon attack.
▶Mark
Looks like the demons aren't comin' into
the store. That's a relief...
  ▶Elly
What a curious feeling... It's as if
everything is all a dream when I'm here.
   ▶Ayase

gonna ditch that idea?
  ▶Ayase

the store open... We never close...

Welcome!▶Maki

not going to be here long, are we?
 ▶Brown
Do we really gotta go to that factory?
It's so dirty for a class act like me!
  ▶Brown
Do we really have to beat Kandori? He got
away! Let's just leave it at that!
   ▶Nanjo
... Oh, sorry, <FirstName>. I was just
lost in thought.
 ▶Mark
So Kandori was behind it all... Are we
still goin' to the abandoned factory?
  ▶Mark
We gotta hurry and catch that Kandori!
  ▶Elly

   ▶Doctor
Well, I can't treat patients who can't
pay. Come back when you have the fee.
  ▶Doctor
I hope you don't run into trouble later
because you cheaped out on treatment.
 ▶Doctor
All right. If anything else comes up,
I recommend you see me immediately.
 ▶Doctor
My time is valuable. If you don't have
any business here, then take a hike.▶Maki
Hey, Masao's at the police station,
right? Let's hurry and free him!
▶Maki
Umm... weren't we going to the abandoned
factory?
   ▶Maki
We have to hurry after Kandori!
 ▶Brown
Man, what a lame store! If it was mine,
I'd make it an outdoor cafe!
   ▶Nanjo
That clerk seems to be suspicious of us.
▶Nanjo
But ARE we really still human now that we
have this power? What do you think?
 ▶Mark
I wish I could be as laid back as you,
<FirstName>.
   ▶Elly
I'm rather surprised that some people
can remain calm. It's very impressive.
▶Ayase
I didn't know you liked this stuff,
<FirstName>! Awww, that's so cute!
   ▶Storekeeper
Are you... truly human? Well, if you're
a customer, I welcome you.▶Maki
The owner here really knows how to sell
his product.
▶Brown
That was my first time in a jail cell!
▶Brown
I was kinda nervous at first... but it
was actually a real blast!
   ▶Nanjo
A well-prepared man fears nothing!
...That's what Yamaoka always said.
 ▶Mark
There's too much I gotta say to Kandori...
I'm not lettin' that guy off easy.
   ▶Elly
We're headed to the abandoned factory,
yes?
▶Elly
I've never given it a thorough look
before, but...
   ▶Elly
We need to pursue Mr.Kandori... We can't
leave him to his own devices!
  ▶Ayase
You're right... If we're gonna march
into SEBEC, we'll need some medicine!
 ▶Ayase
We gotta go after Kandori... Like, who
knows what he's gonna do?
   ▶Clerk
Ah, welcome!
▶Clerk
Hey, have you seen Tamaki?
▶Clerk
I'm really worried about her...
▶Clerk
My son, on the other hand, can take
a running jump!

Hm...? Oh, right, medicine.
Coming right up!
   ▶Clerk
Hmm? Hey, the counter is over here!▶Maki
Huh... Elly's pretty popular.
   ▶Brown
Let me be clear on this: my fans come
a dime a dozen!
  ▶Nanjo
What a feeble mind you possess.
▶Nanjo
Though I'm actually rather jealous that
you can be so calm in this situation.
  ▶Mark
I like the casino too, but right now
I just wanna get to the shrine.
▶Mark
You don't think they'll block the passage
at the factory while we're here?
  ▶Elly
Men like him are so tedious...
  ▶Ayase
What a sap! Eriko, like, isn't anywhere
near the weakling he thinks she is!
▶Yukino
I'm pretty amazed at how fearless Eriko
can be.
   ▶Flirtatious man
Hey, I've been looking for you. You can't
be out and about like this!
▶Flirtatious man
Aren't you scared with all the demons
around? C'mon, let me protect you!
 ▶Elly
Well, that's very generous of you.
▶Elly
But given how much more extensive my
knowledge of demons is than yours...
▶Elly
...Not to mention my ability to protect
myself... Bother  someone  else.

 In this version of poker, you can
change your hand once.
You will be dealt five cards at the
outset.
Use the directional buttons to move to
a card, and press the íȺႨȺùȺࠁ buttons
to hold that card.
Once you have chosen which cards to
hold, press the R button to re-draw
the remaining cards.
If you have a valid hand after the
second draw, you win.
The higher the bet, the larger the
payout for a winning hand will be.
If you win, you can bet the amount
you just won on an Extra Game.
If you'd rather not risk it, choose
"Take Winnings."
There are three types of Extra Game.
Each round you win doubles your
earnings.
By winning the Extra Game, you can
wager up to 1,000,000 coins.
But be careful; one mistake and you'll
lose it all.
<Extra Game 1>
ٰHigh & Low
One card is shown, with four other
cards left face-down.
You must guess which face-down card is
higher than the shown card.
If the card you draw has the same
number as the shown card, the game is
a draw and you may try again.
<Extra Game 2>
ٰBig & Small
One card is shown and one card is
face-down.
You must guess whether the face-down
card is bigger or smaller than the
shown card.
If both cards are equal, you lose,
so be careful.
<Extra Game 3>
ٰRed & Black
One face-down card is dealt.
If you think it's ॵ or ࣚ, choose Red.
If you think it's ਏ or ࢼ, choose Black.
If the color you chose matches the
card's color, you win.

 This is a one-on-one-game of blackjack
against the dealer.
The computer acts as the dealer.
Two cards are dealt to the player and
the dealer at the outset.
One of the dealer's two cards will be
kept face-down.
If the dealer's shown card is an ace,
you may place an insurance bet.
The insurance mechanic will be explained
at the end of these rules.
First, compare your cards to the dealer's
to decide whether to draw another card.
If you decide to draw, select Hit.
If not, select Stand.
You may draw up to 7 cards as long as
their total value remains 21 or lower.
The following circumstances will result
in an automatic Stand:
-Your initial draw is blackjack.
-The total of the cards drawn after
Hitting is 21.
-You draw seven cards.
-The cards' total value surpasses 21,
resulting in a bust.
2 through 10 are face value. J through
K are worth 10, and A is worth either
1 or 11.
After the player Stands, the dealer
will draw cards.
If your total is larger than the
dealer's without surpassing 21...
Or if the dealer busts, you win.
If you and the dealer tie, or if both
of you have blackjack, it is a draw,
and your bet will be returned to you.
Besides Hit and Stand, the player can
also choose to Double Down or Split.
 <D. Down> 
This is only an option while you still
have two cards in your hand.
You may double your bet under the
condition that you only Hit once.
This option will be unavailable if you
have fewer coins than the bet would be.
If you Double Down and beat the dealer,
your winnings will be doubled.
<Split>
You may Split if both of your initial
cards are the same value.
Your hand will be split, with a second
bet covering the other hand.
This option will be unavailable if you
have fewer coins than the bet would be.
Even after a Split, you may Double Down
on either or both hands.
However, if you split, even with a
combination of A with 10 through K...
It will be counted as 21 without being
considered blackjack.

ႬAbout insuranceႭ
An insurance bet is much as it sounds...
It can only be placed if the dealer's
first card is an ace.
Select Yes to place an insurance bet,
and No to decline.
If you select No, the game progresses
normally.
If you select Yes, you must first
pay half your bet as insurance.
If the dealer's second card is 10
through K, forming blackjack...
The initial bet is forfeited.
However...
The insurance bet will pay out at
3 to 1, and the game will end.
If the dealer's card is A through 9,
the insurance is lost and the game
progresses normally.
Since Ⴤ decks of cards are used in this
game, there is a chance that two or more
identical cards will be dealt.

 Winning the game:
If your hand is larger than the dealer's
without going over 21...
Or if the dealer busts, you win.
Blackjack:
An A combined with a second card of
10 through K. (Automatically Stands.)
If you chose to Split, this will not
be counted as blackjack but is 21.
6 Cards:
If you choose Stand when you've drawn
six cards without surpassing 21.

If you've drawn seven cards without
surpassing 21. (Automatically Stands.)

The closer the roll is to 7, the lower
the multiplier. This is because rolls
close to 7 appear more frequently.
Thus, the safe bet is on rolls close
to 7, with rolls like 2 and 12 being
riskier.
In the Extra Game, if a roll of 7
comes up, you lose all your winnings.

 In this version of poker, you can
change your hand once.
You will be dealt five cards at the
outset.
Use the directional buttons to move to
a card, and press the íȺႨȺùȺࠁ buttons
to hold that card.
Once you have chosen which cards to
hold, press the R button to re-draw
the remaining cards.
If you have a valid hand after the
second draw, you win.
The higher the bet, the larger the
payout for a winning hand will be.
If you win, you can bet the amount
you just won on an Extra Game.
If you'd rather not risk it, choose
"Take Winnings."
There are three types of Extra Game.
Each round you win doubles your
earnings.
By winning the Extra Game, you can
wager up to 1,000,000 coins.
But be careful; one mistake and you'll
lose it all.
<Extra Game 1>
ٰHigh & Low
One card is shown, with four other
cards left face-down.
You must guess which face-down card is
higher than the shown card.
If the card you draw has the same
number as the shown card, the game is
a draw and you may try again.
<Extra Game 2>
ٰBig & Small
One card is shown and one card is
face-down.
You must guess whether the face-down
card is bigger or smaller than the
shown card.
If both cards are equal, you lose,
so be careful.
<Extra Game 3>
ٰRed & Black
One face-down card is dealt.
If you think it's ॵ or ࣚ, choose Red.
If you think it's ਏ or ࢼ, choose Black.
If the color you chose matches the
card's color, you win.

 This is a one-on-one-game of blackjack
against the dealer.
The computer acts as the dealer.
Two cards are dealt to the player and
the dealer at the outset.
One of the dealer's two cards will be
kept face-down.
If the dealer's shown card is an ace,
you may place an insurance bet.
The insurance mechanic will be explained
at the end of these rules.
First, compare your cards to the dealer's
to decide whether to draw another card.
If you decide to draw, select Hit.
If not, select Stand.
You may draw up to 7 cards as long as
their total value remains 21 or lower.
The following circumstances will result
in an automatic Stand:
-Your initial draw is blackjack.
-The total of the cards drawn after
Hitting is 21.
-You draw seven cards.
-The cards' total value surpasses 21,
resulting in a bust.
2 through 10 are face value. J through
K are worth 10, and A is worth either
1 or 11.
After the player Stands, the dealer
will draw cards.
If your total is larger than the
dealer's without surpassing 21...
Or if the dealer busts, you win.
If you and the dealer tie, or if both
of you have blackjack, it is a draw,
and your bet will be returned to you.
Besides Hit and Stand, the player can
also choose to Double Down or Split.
 <D. Down> 
This is only an option while you still
have two cards in your hand.
You may double your bet under the
condition that you only Hit once.
This option will be unavailable if you
have fewer coins than the bet would be.
If you Double Down and beat the dealer,
your winnings will be doubled.
<Split>
You may Split if both of your initial
cards are the same value.
Your hand will be split, with a second
bet covering the other hand.
This option will be unavailable if you
have fewer coins than the bet would be.
Even after a Split, you may Double Down
on either or both hands.
However, if you split, even with a
combination of A with 10 through K...
It will be counted as 21 without being
considered blackjack.

ႬAbout insuranceႭ
An insurance bet is much as it sounds...
It can only be placed if the dealer's
first card is an ace.
Select Yes to place an insurance bet,
and No to decline.
If you select No, the game progresses
normally.
If you select Yes, you must first
pay half your bet as insurance.
If the dealer's second card is 10
through K, forming blackjack...
The initial bet is forfeited.
However...
The insurance bet will pay out at
3 to 1, and the game will end.
If the dealer's card is A through 9,
the insurance is lost and the game
progresses normally.
Since Ⴤ decks of cards are used in this
game, there is a chance that two or more
identical cards will be dealt.

If you choose Stand when you've drawn
six cards without surpassing 21.

 This slot machine consists of ࿌
big reels and 16 small reels.
The number of ways to line up a win
increases with the size of your bet.
You can bet up to ৎ coins.
Bets 1, 2, ࿌, and 6 are for the
horizontal lines,while 3, Ⴤ, Ⴤ, 7,
and ৎ are for the vertical lines.
Bets ࿌ through ৎ also add two ways

reels will all start to spin.
Once the reels have spun enough,
the small reels will stop. (The big
reels will continue to spin.)
Press the í, Ⴈ, ù, and ࠁ buttons to
rotate the corresponding reels.
Adjust the small reels so that it will
be easier to line up a pattern.
When you have finished, press the

If three or more of a symbol are lined
up along one of your bets, you win.
Up to five symbols can cross bets 1

bets ࿌ through ৎ.
When the symbols on the big reels match

You can bet on eleven rolls, from 2
to 12, and you may bet on as many rolls
per game as you wish.
However, you may bet a maximum of 100
coins on any given roll.
If you bet on the correct roll, a
multiplier determines your winnings.
You can also stake your winnings on
an Extra Game.
In the Extra Game, you do not predict
the outcome of the roll...
Instead, any roll other than 7 wins.
The amount you win differs depending on

The closer the roll is to 7, the lower
the multiplier. This is because rolls
close to 7 appear more frequently.
Thus, the safe bet is on rolls close
to 7, with rolls like 2 and 12 being
riskier.
In the Extra Game, if a roll of 7
comes up, you lose all your winnings.

We have to chase down Kandori?
Well... if we have to, I guess...

If TVs and radios aren't working, like,
does that mean something's interfering?

Take care on your journey, young ones...▶Teacher
Oh, it's you, <FirstName>. Hey, go
patrol around the school!
▶Teacher
Me? I-I can't leave this spot... I have
to sort out all the reports I get!▶Smitten girl
Oh, hey! It looks like Reiji went outside
a minute ago!
▶Smitten girl
Awww... that was the perfect chance for
me to talk to him!▶Toro
I'm scared of the demons, but I think
this might be my chance!
▶Toro
If I prove to Ayase how macho I am...
She... she might l-like me... right?
|♂> Kenta Yokouchi (Nickname: Toro)
His love of food has made him physically
strong, but emotionally fragile.| 
   ▶Male student
Something's up with Toro. You can see
it in his eyes...
▶Male student
Guess he's still hung up on Ayase. His
type is scary when they can't let go.
 > The lunchlady seems to have already
gone home.▶Short-haired girl
Hey, the principal was right after all
about the guardian of this school!
▶Short-haired girl
I mean, not a single demon has gotten in
here yet, right?
▶Resting boy
Won't she shut up...? All that crap about
guardians and demons... She's dreaming.▶Tadashi
Oh, hey <FirstName>! How's it looking
out there?
▶Tadashi
You went outside, right? Is that cueball
still running the shop?
▶Tamaki
What's the matter, you scared? Go see for
yourself, fraidy cat!
   ▶Tadashi
Wh-What the hell... I ain't s-scared of
those demons!
▶Tadashi
You're scarier than they are, you muscley
freak!
 ▶Tamaki
What did you call me, fraidy cat!?
Fraidy cat, fraidy cat, fraidy cat!
▶Tadashi
Argh! Stupid muscley freak! Muscley freak,
mussel fr--damn, that's hard to say.
  ▶Tadashi
*pant* *pant* She's seriously a piece
of work, isn't she, <FirstName>?
 ▶Tamaki
*pant* *pant*... Hey, <FirstName>.
▶Tamaki
This is for you. I used it at my last
school for... stuff...
▶Tamaki
I get the feeling this one's yours,
not mine...
   ▶Tamaki
Remember, <FirstName>...
▶Tamaki
Some demons are okay. Defeating them
isn't the only way to get things done.
   ▶Male club member
Tamaki's amazing. She knew the names of
every demon we saw out the window!
▶Male club member
She was going on about which ones were
useful, and which ones were antisocial...
▶Male club member
Wait, does that mean demons can join
our side? Huh?
   |♀> Tamaki
A transfer student who joined the Fencing
Club. She's always arguing with Tadashi.| 
   |♂> Tadashi
A lazy member of the Fencing Club who
quarrels with Tamaki every day.| 
   ▶Female club member
It felt like a usual day, with the usual
argument... but something's very wrong.▶Rumor-loving girl
Hey, isn't this the curse of the haunted
mansion at work?
▶Rumor-loving girl
I bet the spirits are angry that SEBEC
built their HQ on top of it!
▶Rumor-loving girl
It must be the ghost of a Sengoku-era
general or something!▶Boy studying for entrance exams
Awesome! Now I don't have to go to
cram school!
▶Boy studying for entrance exams
Oh, but I can't go home, either...
▶Boy studying for entrance exams
If there was an exit that wasn't guarded,
I could just slip out quietly.
  ▶Girl studying for entrance exams
Doesn't that idiot get what kind of
trouble we're in!?
▶Girl studying for entrance exams
Forget the entrance exams! We could
die here!▶Male student
This fuss'll die down by the time
the festival starts, right?
▶Male student
It'd suck if the school festival was
cancelled in all this chaos!
  > The door to the storage room is locked.
 ▶Teacher
Oh, <FirstName>! You're still here!?
▶Teacher
I'm closing off the gym. You should head
to the main building.
▶Teacher
I haven't heard of any demons getting in,
yet, but who knows when they will?
▶Teacher
Hey... where did you get that mask...?
▶Teacher
...Nah, it can't be the same one.
Anyway, you should get out of here.▶Art club member
I thought the art club had it hard
before, and now this!
▶Art club member
Guess it wasn't just the art club,
though... the whole school was cursed.
▶Art club member
Hahaha, what a relief!
...Uh...▶Female student
This place is definitely cursed! It must
be the curse of the haunted mansion!
▶Female student
It should've just affected SEBEC, but
nooo... We had to get dragged in too.
▶Female student
Ugh, honestly! What a pain!
   ▶Male student
I know there are demons outside, but I'm
getting really hungry...
▶Male student
Maybe I could duck out for a bite using
that secret shortcut... Nah, too scary.▶Rumor-loving student
See!? I told you so! SEBEC really was
waging biological warfare!▶Gambling-addicted student
Things have really gotten out of hand.
It's even put me off gambling.
▶Gambling-addicted student
I wonder when it'll all be over...
Hey, wanna bet on when they'll fix it?▶Female student
So that dream was a sign... But the blue
room doesn't seem to be related to this.▶Drama club member
The time has come at last... The ancient
passions cast on this stage will be free!
▶Drama club member
Just kidding! Cool line though, huh?
It's part of the script I wrote.
   ▶Drama club member
Oh, that room is locked.▶Female student
It's a madhouse outside, but it's so
calm here...
▶Female student
I wonder why the demons won't come here.
Could it be divine protection?

I knew there was something funny about
this company...
▶SEBEC employee
But I didn't think they'd resort to
biological warfare!
   ▶SEBEC employee
I saw the ghost of a girl in black
at the office once...
▶SEBEC employee
It must be the curse of the haunted
mansion! Of course!
 ▶Maki
The haunted mansion... I used to go there
a lot to play when I was little.
  ▶Mark
Biological warfare!?
▶Nanjo
What's Kandori doing!? He's treating the
corporation as his personal property!
 ▶Ayase
It's a cool building, but they're doing
some seriously uncool things in it.
▶Brown
With me around, you can deal with ghosts,
biological warfare, you name it!
 ▶Elly
There's a mansion where ghosts appear?
  ▶Reiji
How much more time are we going to
waste on this!? Let's go!▶Receptionist
Hm? The general manager's room? All the
way up... Is he expecting you?
  ▶Receptionist
Eh? You came through the basement?
▶Receptionist
I've heard rumors of a division down there
that's a secret even to employees...
▶Receptionist
But you say you went through it?
   > It's broken and won't open.
 ▶Maki
Secrets not even the employees know?
What's with this company?
  ▶Mark
C'mon, man, quit ogling the secretary
and get on with it.
   ▶Nanjo
It's said that fools and smoke like high
places. Let's head for the top!
   ▶Ayase
SEBEC's suits sure are ugly.
   ▶Brown
If even the insiders are outsiders, maybe
us outsiders shouldn't be inside. Heheh...
   ▶Elly
This isn't the time to be hitting on
the receptionist!
  ▶Reiji
We don't have time to waste. Let's go.▶SEBEC employee
A kid in a uniform like yours passed by
earlier...
▶SEBEC employee
I can't believe something like this
happened on the day of your field trip.
▶SEBEC employee
It must be tough for you kids.
   ▶Angry SEBEC employee
Who the hell changed everything around!?
Why's there a storage room here!?
▶Angry SEBEC employee
And what's with the weird toys!? If I
ever get my hands on this clown...!
 ▶Maki
Looks like these people are victims too.
▶Mark
Let's hurry and find Kandori.
   ▶Nanjo
It seems SEBEC's rank and file know next
to nothing.
   ▶Ayase
There's someone from our school here?
Wonder who that is...
▶Brown
What's a kid from our school doing here?
Wait, don't answer that...
▶Elly
Someone from St. Hermelin besides us?
Whoever could that be?
▶Reiji
......▶Maki
We've gotta get this town back to normal.
   ▶Maki
I can't believe Kandori has a Persona,
too...
   ▶Mark
We just gotta do something about Kandori,
and this town should go back to normal.
   ▶Mark
Let's hurry after Kandori!
  ▶Nanjo
There's no time to waste here.
 ▶Nanjo
There's no time to waste here.
 ▶Ayase
Let's go beat up Kandori! C'mon, hurry!
▶Ayase
Does this mean, like, Kandori had the
dream about the butterfly too?
   ▶Brown
With me on the job, Kandori's got no
future. Mwahahaha...
  ▶Brown
So I guess this means Kandori had the
butterfly dream too.
 ▶Elly
Let's hurry.
▶Elly
Do you suppose Kandori also had that
dream about the butterfly?
 ▶Reiji
......
 ▶Reiji
......▶Maki

This is kinda exciting!
 ▶Nanjo
It looks like we can enter the SEBEC
building now.
 ▶Nanjo
If you're frightened, <FirstName>,
I won't blame you for backing out.
▶Nanjo
I'll defeat that man alone if that's
what it takes!
▶Mark
I feel like Maki's different somehow...
 ▶Elly
Kandori's at SEBEC, yes?
▶Elly
We've brushed up against something
incredible... This could be interesting!
 ▶Brown
Dude, I'm getting all restless! Just turn
me loose already!
▶Ayase
Hey, so like, we're just ordinary high
school kids, right?
▶Ayase
So even SEBEC wouldn't shoot at little
old us, would they...?
   ▶Ayase
You're such a liar, <FirstName>!
Kandori was totally gonna kill us!▶Trish
Hi! I'm Trish and this is my fountain
of healing!
▶Trish
This world runs on give-and-take! Give
me money and I'll take away your pain!
▶Trish
What do you say?ԙ
 ▶Trish
Okay!
  ▶Trish
Umm, with the going rate for healing...
And all of you put together...
 ▶Trish
It'll be 2,000 yen.
That's okay, right? 
  ▶Trish
Great! Then here goes!
Pain, pain, go away!
▶Trish
Phew... That should do it!
You're all good to go!
▶Trish
Need anything else? 
▶Trish
You don't have enough!? Boo to that!
There's nothing I hate like poor people!
▶Trish
Come back when your wallet's fuller.
Bye-bye!
▶Trish
Boo to that! You mangy, dirty bum!
Don't blame me if you wind up dead!

Well, come again. I'll be waiting!
Bye-bye!

You called me out for no reason!?
Boo to that! Get outta here!▶Agastya Tree

That scientist says he knows my mom...
▶Maki
But I don't have a mother!
▶Nanjo
Those scientists... What kind of research
is going on here?
▶Mark
This is one suspicious place.
▶Mark
Huh... guess the rumors about SEBEC
had a little truth to 'em!
 ▶Elly
Whatever they were researching, they must
have had to keep it a secret.
 ▶Brown
What a boring place! Don't they have
anything cool here?
   ▶Ayase
Hmm... this box is totally suspicious.
 ▶Scientist
This isn't the basement...? Why is this
room above ground!?
▶Scientist
Excuse me, did you see a woman on your
way here? She had short hair and glasses.
▶Scientist
Oh, Sonomura... please be safe!
   ▶Scientist
Kandori must have used that machine...
 ▶Scientist
I can't believe this! 
▶Scientist
We couldn't have calculated it would even
change this building's structure...!
  > The door doesn't seem like it
will open...▶Maki
It sounds like someone from St. Hermelin
snuck in here before us!
   ▶Nanjo
That Kandori... He's gone too far!
 ▶Mark
Don't these guys feel guilty at all
for what they did?
  ▶Elly
Did Kandori have them build a machine
that gives birth to demons?
   ▶Brown
I dunno if I like how complicated this
is starting to get...
▶Brown
There's some stuff even I can't
understand, y'know!
   ▶Ayase
Who's this Dr. Nicholai guy?
   ▶Scientist
Was that high school boy a friend of
yours? I'm sorry to say, he was...
▶Scientist
Dr. Nicholai seems to have been planning
to stop Kandori... but what can we do?
▶Scientist
None of us predicted that demons would
emerge in town.
▶Scientist
Though it presents a rather intriguing
situation, don't you think?
  > The door doesn't seem like it
will open...▶Maki
I feel like I've seen this place before.
▶Nanjo
<FirstName>... Are your weapons ready?
   ▶Nanjo
<FirstName>... Are your weapons ready?
We won't let him escape this time!
▶Mark
Just a little longer... Soon we'll beat
Kandori and get the town back to normal.
▶Mark
Let's get that Kandori and bring this
town back to normal!
  ▶Elly
Is it me, or do you hear the loud
clanking of machinery?
▶Brown
...I wish *I* had my own scientists.
   ▶Ayase
Those guys are the worst! All they care
about is their own research!
   ▶Scientist
Is Kandori planning on staying in a safe
location while the demons get us!?
▶Scientist
I don't see Dr. Nicholai anywhere...
▶Scientist
I knew he had his own secret projects,
but he must've been in with Kandori!
   ▶Scientist
At this rate, all our valuable test data
will be ruined! My precious research...!
  > The door doesn't seem like it
will open...▶Maki
What does SEBEC do, anyway?
 ▶Maki
Let's hurry after Kandori!
  ▶Nanjo
I've never gotten along with Kandori,
ever since meeting him at a party.
▶Nanjo
I wish I had known his scheme then...
 ▶Mark
It's possible we'll all end up dead.
▶Mark
And y'know, that's fine, but imagining
that hag...
▶Mark
I mean, my mom, crying over it...
It bugs the hell out of me.
 ▶Elly
I wonder what's going to happen next.
Ahaha... I can hardly contain myself!
 ▶Elly
Let's hurry after Mr. Kandori!
  ▶Brown
C'mon, let's go beat that Kandori jerk!
▶Brown
Th-There's no way I'm letting him get
to me, y'know?
   ▶Brown
Are, uh... are we really in a rush
to get to Kandori...?
   ▶Ayase
Tch, I'm like, totally not scared.
...Okay, okay, I kinda am.▶Yuko
My father's going to hire me a bodyguard
so I don't get attacked by demons.
▶Yuko
Why don't you get one, too? Oh...
I suppose that's impossible for you, hmm?
▶Yuko
It would cost quite a bit of money,
after all. So sorry.
  |♀> Yuko Himeno
You knew her as a kind girl working part-
time to support her family, but...| 
▶Mark
...That was Yuko, right? Am I seein'
things? Did she used to be like that...?
   ▶Yuko
Oh my, Nanjo. Are you still mingling
with that sort?
▶Nanjo
...It's not as though I enjoy it.
  ▶Mark
"That sort"? Is she talkin' about us?
   ▶Brown
She's... she's talking about me! Hey!
  ▶Ayase
What the hell!? Was Yuko always this
stuck-up?
 ▶Elly
..."That sort"? I thought for a moment
I heard her say something like that...
▶Elly
But I must have been hearing things,
surely?
   ▶Nanjo
True, they're a pack of imbeciles and
could be considered "that sort"...
▶Nanjo
But then why does it anger me so to
hear others say it...?
▶Nanjo
What on earth...? Did your dinner
disagree with you, Yuko?
 ▶Mark
Whaddaya mean, "that sort"!?
▶Brown
Y'know, I've always thought I should
choose my friends more carefully!
 ▶Elly
It's good to be self-confident, but...
That's going too far.
▶Ayase
That's SO not like Yuko! She's not
that kinda girl!
▶Yuko
Yes? What is it? Don't speak to me
without a good reason!
   ▶Male student
I can't stand Yuko! Why is Maki still
friends with her, anyway?
 ▶Female student
Everyone loves Maki and everyone hates
Yuko. But oddly enough, they're friends.▶Brown
Chisato sure was pretty...
▶Brown
Hey Mark, why don't you go get yourself
kidnapped in her place?
 ▶Nanjo
Chisato Kasai... So she's missing here,
too. The fates must have it in for her...
  ▶Mark
Man, I forget sometimes what a good
painter Maki is.
▶Elly
A girl in black... Very strange indeed.
 ▶Ayase
I wonder if Chisato really liked Yosuke.
▶Ayase
I mean, he wasn't exactly her type.
   ▶Male student
Maki's painting won another art contest!
I'm pretty proud of her.
   ▶Male student
Chisato, on the other hand, never won
anything.
▶Male student
Plus she got taken by the girl in black...
She's got some seriously bad luck.
▶Female student
Did you hear? Chisato got kidnapped by
the girl in black.
▶Female student
I feel so bad for Yosuke that I can
hardly stand to look at him.
   ▶Female student
Maki was good friends with Chisato.
She must be awfully worried.▶Maki
Ms. Saeko is always so sad! She's kinda
getting me down, too.
   ▶Brown
Huh? Is something up, Ms. Saeko?
   ▶Brown
It feels wrong when Ms. Saeko doesn't
have enough energy to light the room.
▶Nanjo
Even Ms. Saeko is acting strangely...
  ▶Nanjo
I'm sure Yukino would be shocked to see
Ms. Saeko this way.
▶Mark
H-Huh? Hey, what's wrong, Ms. Saeko?
And don't just say you overate again!
▶Mark
We might be better off with this one. She
won't make us do push-ups as punishment.
  ▶Elly
This version of Ms. Saeko is silent...?
I wonder if she's angry about something.
  ▶Elly
Her face is the same, but her altered
demeanor makes her seem like someone else.
▶Ayase
Ewww... she's all mopey.
   ▶Ayase
Our Ms. Saeko is way prettier.
 ▶Reiji
...Hmph. I like her better now that
she's not so loud.
   ▶Nurse Natsumi
Oh, <FirstName>, did you hurt yourself?
  ▶Mark
Ooh, it's Nurse Natsumi!
▶Ms. Saeko
......
 ▶Brown
Hey, Ms. Saeko! Long time no see!
You're beautiful as always...
▶Ayase
Heeey! It's Ms. Saeko! Look, Ms. Saeko,
it's me, Ayase! Could you tell?
▶Elly
Oh, Ms. Saeko... I'm sorry I caused you
such trouble before...
  ▶Nanjo
Ah, Ms. Saeko. It feels as though we
haven't seen you in a while.
  ▶Mark
She's... ԺShe's all depressed...!
  ▶Nurse Natsumi
That was quite a shock, a moment ago!
▶Nurse Natsumi
But I hear you rescued us, so thanks
very much!
  ▶Nanjo
She's... ԺShe's so despondent...!
 ▶Agastya Tree
Young ones... Your presence is welcome.
 ▶Agastya Tree
Will you inscribe your story on me? 
   ▶Agastya Tree
Take care on your journey, young ones...▶Nurse Natsumi
If you're not feeling well, come to the
infirmary! Let's have a look at you.
   ▶Nurse Natsumi
Alright, that should do it. Don't let
the demons get you, okay?▶Brown
Huh? Wasn't that dude the student council
president at our school?
 ▶Nanjo
So someone else is president here...
A wise decision.
▶Nanjo
Though it doesn't seem as though there
was a new election...
 ▶Mark
Heh, guy got what he deserved!
▶Mark
The one before had big plans, but did
diddly squat.
   ▶Elly
Now this is the way a student council
is supposed to be.
▶Ayase
I hated that other president. He was
like, all high and mighty.
▶Student council member
What are these fools thinking, passing me
over as president!?
▶Student council member
I dreamed of going down in St. Hermelin
history as a perfect council president!!
   ▶Student council president
Now that I'm president, I'll see to it
that the council works hard for everyone!
   ▶Student council member
Our president's really into it. It makes
us feel like we should try just as hard.
 ▶Student council member
He's supposedly trying to be like one of
the past presidents... Yama-something.▶Maki
Reiji's... kinda scary...
 ▶Nanjo
What nonsense!
 ▶Nanjo
Love is all in the mind. You think you're
in love, so you're in love.
  ▶Mark
I bet somewhere out there, there's a girl
watching me from afar too...
  ▶Mark
So she was a fan of Reiji... Uh...Ԟ
Not that I'm jealous or nothin'!
   ▶Elly
...Is love at first sight even possible?
  ▶Elly
...I don't understand at all. There's no
reason to be so desperate.
   ▶Brown
Hey, c'mon! Why isn't she MY fan?
  ▶Brown
Tch... I'm just as good as him!
▶Ayase
All the guys at this school are such
children. None of them interest me.
   ▶Ayase
Sure, he's kinda mature... But Reiji's
different, y'know?
  ▶Reiji
What the hell? That girl's glaring at
me... Did I do something?
  ▶Smitten girl
Oh, hey. Um... I saw this really cool
guy a second ago.
▶Smitten girl
I've never seen him before. A transfer
student, maybe? Oh man, who is he...?
   ▶Smitten girl
...ԞOh! Do you know that guy?
▶Smitten girl
C'mon, introduce us! Pleeeease!▶Principal Ooishi
Oh! Did something happen, <FirstName>...?
▶Principal Ooishi
Don't tell me that girl in black showed
up again!
▶Nanjo
No, that's not it. But who's this girl
in black you mentioned...?
  ▶Vice-Principal Hanya
You haven't heard about her, Kei? A girl
in black clothes has been appearing...
▶Vice-Principal Hanya
It only started happening recently.
They say she controls demons.
▶Elly
There are demons here as well...?
   ▶Brown
The demons are here, too?
  ▶Ayase
There's demons here too...?
▶Mark
Whoa... there are demons over here,
too...?
 ▶Vice-Principal Hanya
But don't worry! Principal Ooishi and I
will protect you children!
  ▶Mark
Wh... What the hell!? Why's Hamya bein'
so nice to us!?
▶Mark
U-Um, we gotta get goin'!
▶Principal Ooishi
<FirstName>! I'm glad you're all safe...
  ▶Vice-Principal Hanya
Thank goodness... But what was that?
▶Vice-Principal Hanya
From what I can tell, the school's layout
has been shaken up...
 ▶Maki
Don't worry! We'll protect you!
 ▶Vice-Principal Hanya
Did you hear that, Ms. Ooishi!?
So considerate of her...
▶Vice-Principal Hanya
It can only be the result of the stellar
education you provide!
 ▶Principal Ooishi
Oh, no, no, Hanya. It's due to your
guidance!
   ▶Nanjo
...I can't take this much longer.
Let's go, <FirstName>!
 |♀> Principal Ooishi
The principal of St. Hermelin High.
She adores children and flowers.| 
   |♂> Vice-Principal Hanya
Was extremely strict and hated by all
the students before, but now...| ▶Maki
The town's probably pretty different
from your town, too!
   ▶Nanjo
The school troubles have been settled
for now, but...
  ▶Mark
This is so weird. I know their faces,
but they're not quite the same...
 ▶Elly
We won't accomplish anything if we stay
here. Let's go outside!
 ▶Brown
This school can't contain my full glory!
Mwahahahaha!
  ▶Ayase
Why was she trying to trap us here?
▶Reiji
I got no business at a school. I just
wanna hurry and kill that bastard.
   ▶Mark
Yo, Yukino! Long time no see!
   ▶Yukino
Well, not THAT long.
  ▶Nanjo
No, I suppose not.
▶Nanjo
We played that Persona game, visited the
hospital, and then the incident happened.
  ▶Yukino
......?
   ▶Nanjo
Weren't you there? I thought I recalled
you seeing everything alongside us.
▶Yukino
"Persona game"? Visiting who at the
hospital? What're you talking about?
  ▶Nanjo
You don't remember? Or... are you not
the Yukino we're familiar with?
▶Nanjo
...In any case, we should leave soon.
▶Mark
Hey <FirstName>, didn't Yosuke tell us
to come to the library?
▶Mark
We should hear him out before we go.▶Maki
Looks like we're the only ones with
these powers.
   ▶Nanjo
I doubt Kandori will stay this quiet.
Heaven knows what he'll do next...
   ▶Nanjo
That girl seems very powerful...
▶Nanjo
If someone else is abusing that power,
we may be in serious trouble.
  ▶Mark
Huh. There's no hole here.
  ▶Mark
No doubt about it, that's no ordinary
little girl.
  ▶Elly
Let the demons come! It'll be fine!
We'll just have to get involved.
▶Elly
Though one may look innocent and angelic,
one may be very different inside.
 ▶Brown
Everywhere we go, it's demons this and
demons that.
▶Brown
Can't they talk about something fun?
   ▶Brown
She keeps pulling those pranks, and I'm
gonna give her a spanking!
 ▶Ayase
Something's weird about this school.
It, like... smells fake.
  ▶Ayase
So this isn't our school? No wonder it
felt all phony!
 ▶Reiji
What a carefree bunch... Kicking back
without knowing what's going on.
 ▶Student
Why does that girl keep attacking the
school? Does she have some kinda grudge?
   ▶Male student
I don't think anything that happens now
could surprise me.
▶Male student
You could tell me you have supernatural
powers and I wouldn't bat an eye.
▶Male student
Huh...? You do!? Oh, c'mon! That can't
possibly be true, right?
  ▶Male student
Doesn't that girl in black look like
someone we know?
   ▶Male student
Now I remember... I met a girl like
that in white before.
▶Male student
White clothes... You don't think
there's a connection here, do you?▶Maki
The gym at your school is new, right?
Does it have club rooms?
  ▶Nanjo
This gym should be condemned. I wouldn't
be surprised if it collapsed any moment.
  ▶Mark
The curtain's full of holes... makes it
easy to sneak a peek. Kidding...!
▶Mark
I'm no peepin' Tom!
▶Elly
The more I see of this town, the less
I understand.
▶Elly
It really does seem to be the world
of the past...
   ▶Brown
Tch, what a dump. They should just bring
the whole thing down!
 ▶Ayase
I don't think I've ever been here before.
  ▶Reiji
I can't keep up with your wandering
around the school.
 ▶Ballet club member
Hey! You better not be here to peep
on us!
▶Mark
H-Hell no! I wouldn't do that...
▶Ballet club member
Can't we get our own room!? Then we
wouldn't have to deal with this crap!
 ▶Mark
I told you already, I didn't come here
to peep on you fools!
▶Elly
It's no use, Mark... Let's be on our way.
   ▶Brown
Face it, Mark, it's useless. C'mon, man!
   ▶Ayase
What do you expect, Masao? You do bad
stuff all the time! C'mon, let's go.
 ▶Nanjo
You're getting rather worked up over
something so trivial, Masao. Let's go.▶Scared girl
I-It's that girl! The one who kidnapped
Chisato! She had demons with her...
▶Scared girl
Is waiting here to get attacked by
demons the only choice we have!?
▶Maki
Everything will be fine! Don't worry...
Leave it to us!
 ▶Maki
Let's hurry and go, <FirstName>!▶Male student
I've seen someone before who looked
kinda like that girl in black.
  ▶Nanjo
Are you saying there's another one
like her, then?
 ▶Male student
I think so.
▶Male student
Well... it's a forest now, but remember
what used to be the flower garden?
▶Male student
I saw her playing there.
   ▶Mark
Uhh, if this forest used to be a flower
garden... I don't get this town at all.
 ▶Elly
A forest... Could it be the one Yosuke
mentioned, where the police station was?
 ▶Ayase
Think that's the forest Yosuke talked
about? He said it was the police station.
▶Brown
Yosuke was talking about some forest. He
said it's where the police station was.
   ▶Nanjo
A forest? Hmmm... Yosuke did say that a
forest had replaced the police station.
▶Maki
The police station is where we went to
rescue Masao and Hidehiko, right?
▶Maki
Now that you mention it, that is the
area where it should be...
▶Maki
It was a beautiful flower garden. I was
surprised to see it become a forest.
 ▶Male student
What're you people mumbling about?
Something's funny about you guys...
▶Male student
Hey, are you really <FirstName>?
▶Maki
Hey, we should hurry and get going!
We have to go... See you!▶Maki
Let's find that girl! She must be
somewhere in the school!
  ▶Nanjo
Why is that girl attacking the school...?
What does she hope to gain?
  ▶Mark
When are we gonna get to rescue the
real Maki...?
   ▶Elly
Do you think the girl in black will have
demons with her?
▶Elly
If so, we should prepare ourselves before
facing her.
  ▶Brown
Dude, <FirstName>, aren't you worried
about leaving these ladies behind?
▶Brown
Just say the word and I'll stay here to
protect 'em for you!
▶Ayase
It's kind of a relief to see an infirmary
in a place like this... I dunno why.
 ▶Reiji
What's with the silent teacher?
▶Agastya Tree
Young ones... Your presence is welcome.
 ▶Agastya Tree
Will you inscribe your story on me? 
   ▶Agastya Tree
Take care on your journey, young ones...
▶Nurse Natsumi
Oh, hi <FirstName>. What's going on
out there?
▶Nurse Natsumi
I don't know what to do... I'm in a real
fix. ԮRight, Ms. Saeko?
 ▶Ms. Saeko
......
 ▶Nurse Natsumi
I thought she'd at least speak up at a
time like this... ԺBut she's still down.
   ▶Nurse Natsumi
If you're hurt, come to the infirmary!
Let's have a look at you.
   ▶Nurse Natsumi
Alright, that should do it. Don't let
the demons get you, okay?▶Agastya Tree
Young ones... Your presence is welcome.
 ▶Agastya Tree
Will you inscribe your story on me? 
   ▶Agastya Tree
Take care on your journey, young ones...▶Agastya Tree
Young ones... Your presence is welcome.
 ▶Agastya Tree
Will you inscribe your story on me? 
   ▶Agastya Tree
Take care on your journey, young ones...▶Yuko
Oh... What do you want? Did you come to
longingly examine our valuables?
▶Yuko
I'm afraid they're not accessible to the
public. So they're not stolen, you see.
▶Mark
Why would we care about that stuff?
What, you think we're thieves?
  ▶Yuko
My, is that how it came across? I didn't
mean that at all.
▶Yuko
It sounds as though you have an
inferiority complex.
  ▶Elly
<FirstName>... I'm a little disgusted now.
Do you mind if I wait outside?
 ▶Brown
Ugh That does it! You think you're all
that just 'cause you're sorta rich!?
▶Ayase
Y'know, you were a lot cuter before.
   ▶Reiji
...I'll be waiting outside.
▶Maki
Yuko! That's so rude! Apologize to them.
▶Yuko
But Maki... You're my friend!
These people are just... just...
  ▶Maki
Sheesh, Yuko... Oh, well.
   ▶Maki
C'mon, everyone, let's go.
  |♀> Yuko Himeno
You knew her as a kind girl working part-
time to support her family, but...| 
▶Yuko
Maki, won't you come in for some tea?
▶Yuko
I have an extra serving of cake that our
own personal patissier baked.
▶Yuko
I'm sure my brothers would be delighted
to see you, too!
 ▶Maki
Yuko... All right. I'll stop by with
everyone next time.
▶Yuko
...How dull.
▶Yuko
Hm? You again? All right... Just today,
you're all specially invited.
   ▶Mark
Why're you so... Ohhh, I get it. You're
scared 'cause the town's gone weird, huh?
   ▶Yuko
N-Not at all!
▶Yuko
I have my doberman, John, and our butler,
Sebastian with me!
▶Yuko
I'm not afraid in the least!
   ▶Nanjo
Heh. Perhaps we'll stop by after
everything's been resolved.▶Kaneda
What d'you kids want?
▶Kaneda
You're not debt collectors, are you?
'Cause there's no money here!
▶Kaneda
Those ruins I was countin' on didn't have
any treasure, so there goes my business!
 |♀> Katsue Kaneda
She should have been rich and living
in an opulent mansion, but...| 
▶Nanjo
Business? What sort of business were
you conducting in the ruins?
  ▶Maki
Sheesh, Nanjo! Kaneda's a ruin raider.
  ▶Elly
That's not a real job. And anyway, that
kind of thing is illegal in this country.
▶Elly
You say some odd things, Maki.
 ▶Brown
Ruin raiding!? You can't do that in
Japan! Talk sense, Maki.
   ▶Ayase
Ruin raiding? Really?
▶Ayase
No way would anyone do something like
that for a living...
▶Ayase
Snap out of it, Maki.
 ▶Reiji
Ruin raiding...?
▶Reiji
No one actually does that. You're not a
kid, Maki, so cut it out with that stuff.
 ▶Maki
But that's what everyone says...
▶Mark
Hey, that reminds me... There was a rumor
about how that old lady got so rich...
▶Mark
About a year back, people were sayin' it
was 'cause she went around raidin' ruins.
▶Mark
You believed that stuff, Maki? But then
again... you are a different Maki.
▶Kaneda
Will you shut your yap!? If you got no
business with me, scram!
   ▶Kaneda
You're still here!? If you got no
business with me, scram!
▶Nanjo
<FirstName>. Maki said that Kaneda was
working as a ruin raider, yes?
▶Nanjo
In our town, that was nothing more than
a rumor...
▶Nanjo
But it seems the rumor has become reality
here. Why, though...?
 ▶Maki
A rumor becoming reality...?
▶Maki
N-No... my head hurts... Hey guys,
can we get going?
▶Kaneda
What the hell's happened to this town!?
Everything's gone to the dogs!
▶Kaneda
You kids are strong, huh? Aren'tcha
ashamed of doing nothing about it all!?
   ▶Mark
Listen, you old hag, we're doin' the
best we can!
   ▶Elly
Cool it, Mark...
▶Elly
I'm sure Maki's fine. Let's get
back to searching for her!
  ▶Elly
Stay calm, Mark...
▶Elly
Mark will be just fine, I know it.
Now let's resume our search for her.
   ▶Elly
Cool it, Mark...
▶Elly
Relax! It'll all be over soon.
  ▶Elly
Stay calm, Mark... Never fear. It will
all be resolved soon.
▶Brown
Don't get all pissy, dude. I'll fix
everything before you know it!
 ▶Ayase
Aww, don't get mad, Masao. Everything'll
be back to normal soon!
   ▶Reiji
Calm down, Masao. Just put up with this
a little longer, and it'll fix itself.▶Maki
The girl in white clothes must be
little Mai.
   ▶Nanjo
The weapons here are strictly for
dealing with demons.
▶Nanjo
No wonder the police aren't needed...
   ▶Mark
No matter how many times I come here,
I'm never gonna get used to that.
▶Mark
It's so weird bein' asked, "What weapon
would you like?" with a smile.
   ▶Elly
All the magazines here carry a cover date
of roughly a year ago.
▶Elly
These magazines are all out of date.
I remember them coming out a year ago.
 ▶Brown
Huh? I coulda sworn this model retired.
What's she doing on the cover?
 ▶Ayase
Oh man, check out this model! Her clothes
are like, way old fash--
▶Ayase
Hey... This is last year's issue!
   ▶Reiji
What's with this store? All these mags
are a year old.
 ▶Young man
That beautiful patch of flowers is a
forest all of a sudden.
▶Young man
Is there a tree-planting campaign on?
 ▶Area man
There was a girl who used to play in that
flower patch all the time.
▶Area man
I wonder what she's been up to since the
place turned into a forest.
▶Area man
Huh? Black clothes?
▶Area man
No, she was a cute little girl in white.
 ▶Clerk
Welcome! Care to see our selection
of weapons?
 ▶Clerk
Eek! That doesn't open! If you want to
buy something, come to the counter!▶Maki
I don't get that lady... She says she's
nervous when things are too nice.
▶Maki
I think it's wonderful when things are
nice every day! Don't you?
  ▶Nanjo
I'm not picky, but if they have any
armor with "ኍ1" markings...
▶Nanjo
Mm, probably not. Never mind...
▶Mark
My mom has the worst fashion sense!
▶Mark
Last time she went shopping, she got me
a t-shirt with a huge airbrushed wolf.
▶Mark
Where in the world does she find this
stuff!?
▶Mark
Oh... uh... Not that I'm worried about
my mom or anything. Don't get me wrong.
▶Elly
I never enjoy arming myself...
  ▶Brown
Get me some armor, <Nickname>! I don't
care if it works, but it has to look cool!
   ▶Ayase
I want a miniskirt. Don't long skirts
look, like, so old-fashioned?
▶Reiji
I don't give a crap what I wear.
Can we hurry this up?
 ▶Area woman
I'm lucky to be able to live in a town
this amazing.
▶Area woman
But when things get TOO amazing, it
makes people nervous.
▶Area woman
You start wondering if it's all a dream
that'll end when you wake up.
▶Mannequin
Hey there. What're you looking for,
handsome?
▶Mannequin
If you want, I can help pick out the
right size for you!▶Maki
I've heard of Shibuya, but what's
Daikanyama? Is that a place?
▶Maki
There's a city called that in your world?
Huh...
  ▶Nanjo
<FirstName>... Do you also think things are
fine as long as you enjoy each day?
▶Nanjo
Would you idle away the hours, never
knowing what lurks behind that peace?
   ▶Mark
Daikanyama is pretty small compared to
Shibuya...
▶Mark
But it's been in a bunch of magazines
lately. These girls oughtta know it.
 ▶Elly
It's simply not possible to enjoy
EVERY day of one's life.
▶Elly
Self-control is called for now and
again, no?
 ▶Brown
Me, I'd rather be having a good time,
all the time.
▶Brown
Like being surrounded by cute, squealing
girls... Heeheehee.
 ▶Ayase
I'd rather just do fun stuff, too.
▶Ayase
We gotta hurry and beat up Kandori so I
can go back to being a normal girl!
 ▶Reiji
Are they complete idiots? There's no way
everything can be fun and games!
  ▶High school girl
We used to be able to go party past
the subway...
▶High school girl
But now there's a weird wall on the
surface and a monster at the ticket gate.
▶High school girl
I mean, no one used the subway anyways,
but having fewer hangouts kinda sucks.
▶High school girl
Hey, you know how the subway monster's
gone now?
▶High school girl
Well, I thought I'd go to the other side
of town for some fun...
▶High school girl
But something's weird there. I got scared
and came back before I got to the market.
 ▶High school girl
I went through the subway to go party
on the other side of town.
▶High school girl
And everyone over there's talking about
how some Queen disappeared. Huh...?
 ▶High school girl
I can't wait to leave home and go live
on my own!
▶High school girl
I'm gonna get a place by the plasma wall.
The night view is awesome out there.
 ▶Mark
Wouldn't you wanna live somewhere like
Shibuya or Daikanyama?
   ▶High school girl
Daikan-what? I don't get it.
▶High school girl
Well, whatever. I like this town, so I'm
gonna stay here.
 ▶Man
I love this place! Every day is great!
I just wish the demons weren't here.
▶Man
There've been an awful lot of them
lately...

In this version of poker, you can
change your hand once.
You will be dealt five cards at the
outset.
Use the directional buttons to move to
a card, and press the íȺႨȺùȺࠁ buttons
to hold that card.
Once you have chosen which cards to
hold, press the R button to re-draw
the remaining cards.
If you have a valid hand after the
second draw, you win.
The higher the bet, the larger the
payout for a winning hand will be.
If you win, you can bet the amount
you just won on an Extra Game.
If you'd rather not risk it, choose
"Take Winnings."
There are three types of Extra Game.
Each round you win doubles your
earnings.
By winning the Extra Game, you can
wager up to 1,000,000 coins.
But be careful; one mistake and you'll
lose it all.
<Extra Game 1>
ٰHigh & Low
One card is shown, with four other
cards left face-down.
You must guess which face-down card is
higher than the shown card.
If the card you draw has the same
number as the shown card, the game is
a draw and you may try again.
<Extra Game 2>
ٰBig & Small
One card is shown and one card is
face-down.
You must guess whether the face-down
card is bigger or smaller than the
shown card.
If both cards are equal, you lose,
so be careful.
<Extra Game 3>
ٰRed & Black
One face-down card is dealt.
If you think it's ॵ or ࣚ, choose Red.
If you think it's ਏ or ࢼ, choose Black.
If the color you chose matches the
card's color, you win.

   > It's a video blackjack machine.

 > What would you like explained?ԍ
This is a one-on-one-game of blackjack
against the dealer.
The computer acts as the dealer.
Two cards are dealt to the player and
the dealer at the outset.
One of the dealer's two cards will be
kept face-down.
If the dealer's shown card is an ace,
you may place an insurance bet.
The insurance mechanic will be explained
at the end of these rules.
First, compare your cards to the dealer's
to decide whether to draw another card.
If you decide to draw, select Hit.
If not, select Stand.
You may draw up to 7 cards as long as
their total value remains 21 or lower.
The following circumstances will result
in an automatic Stand:
-Your initial draw is blackjack.
-The total of the cards drawn after
Hitting is 21.
-You draw seven cards.
-The cards' total value surpasses 21,
resulting in a bust.
2 through 10 are face value. J through
K are worth 10, and A is worth either
1 or 11.
After the player Stands, the dealer
will draw cards.
If your total is larger than the
dealer's without surpassing 21...
Or if the dealer busts, you win.
If you and the dealer tie, or if both
of you have blackjack, it is a draw,
and your bet will be returned to you.
Besides Hit and Stand, the player can
also choose to Double Down or Split.
 <D. Down> 
This is only an option while you still
have two cards in your hand.
You may double your bet under the
condition that you only Hit once.
This option will be unavailable if you
have fewer coins than the bet would be.
If you Double Down and beat the dealer,
your winnings will be doubled.
<Split>
You may Split if both of your initial
cards are the same value.
Your hand will be split, with a second
bet covering the other hand.
This option will be unavailable if you
have fewer coins than the bet would be.
Even after a Split, you may Double Down
on either or both hands.
However, if you split, even with a
combination of A with 10 through K...
It will be counted as 21 without being
considered blackjack.

ႬAbout insuranceႭ
An insurance bet is much as it sounds...
It can only be placed if the dealer's
first card is an ace.
Select Yes to place an insurance bet,
and No to decline.
If you select No, the game progresses
normally.
If you select Yes, you must first
pay half your bet as insurance.
If the dealer's second card is 10
through K, forming blackjack...
The initial bet is forfeited.
However...
The insurance bet will pay out at
3 to 1, and the game will end.
If the dealer's card is A through 9,
the insurance is lost and the game
progresses normally.
Since Ⴤ decks of cards are used in this
game, there is a chance that two or more
identical cards will be dealt.

 Winning the game:
If your hand is larger than the dealer's
without going over 21...
Or if the dealer busts, you win.
Blackjack:
An A combined with a second card of
10 through K. (Automatically Stands.)
If you chose to Split, this will not
be counted as blackjack but is 21.
6 Cards:
If you choose Stand when you've drawn
six cards without surpassing 21.
7 Cards:
If you've drawn seven cards without
surpassing 21. (Automatically Stands.)

This slot machine consists of ࿌
big reels and 16 small reels.
The number of ways to line up a win
increases with the size of your bet.
You can bet up to ৎ coins.
Bets 1, 2, ࿌, and 6 are for the
horizontal lines,while 3, Ⴤ, 7,
and ৎ are for the vertical lines.
Bets ࿌ through ৎ also add two ways
to line up a win per bet.
When the game begins, the big and small
reels will all start to spin.
Once the reels have spun enough,
the small reels will stop. (The big
reels will continue to spin.)
Press the í, Ⴈ, ù, and ࠁ buttons to
rotate the corresponding reels.
Adjust the small reels so that it will
be easier to line up a pattern.
When you have finished, press the
R button to stop the big reels.
If three or more of a symbol are lined
up along one of your bets, you win.
Up to five symbols can cross bets 1
through Ⴤ, and up to four can cross
bets ࿌ through ৎ.
When the symbols on the big reels match
diagonally, in all four corners, or all
five at once...
You win regardless of which lines you
bet on.
Earnings for hits on the big reels
increase according to the number of
bets you made.

   Different slot machines have different
patterns and odds.
It's best to try out different machines
rather than concentrating on one.
Be careful not to forget to rotate the
small reels during the game.
Careful adjustment of the small reels
is key to maximizing your payout.
If you begin the game with fewer bets,
you may face greater losses when it
matters most.

In this game, two dice are rolled on
screen, and you predict the outcome.
You can bet on eleven rolls, from 2
to 12, and you may bet on as many rolls
per game as you wish.
However, you may bet a maximum of 100
coins on any given roll.
If you bet on the correct roll, a
multiplier determines your winnings.
You can also stake your winnings on
an Extra Game.
In the Extra Game, you do not predict
the outcome of the roll...
Instead, any roll other than 7 wins.
The amount you win differs depending on
the roll.
If the roll is 7, the Extra Game ends
and all your winnings are lost, so be
careful.

The closer the roll is to 7, the lower
the multiplier. This is because rolls
close to 7 appear more frequently.
Thus, the safe bet is on rolls close
to 7, with rolls like 2 and 12 being
riskier.
In the Extra Game, if a roll of 7
comes up, you lose all your winnings.

not to get greedy and leave with a

The demons only really started getting
bad here a little while ago.
▶Maki
But even then, there hasn't been much
talk of them attacking people.
 ▶Nanjo
Demons that ignore humans...?
But clearly, they've attacked us.
▶Nanjo
Could they be choosing their targets?
Inconceivable...
 ▶Mark
Woo! I'm Mr. Frog! Ribbit, ribbit!
Just kidding.
▶Mark
Quit looking so grim! Let's do this
with a smile, man!
  ▶Elly
My skin's been in bad condition lately...
Fighting demons is strenuous work.
▶Brown
It's been tough going lately. Even I
can't beat the aging process.
 ▶Ayase
N-No way! There's pit viper in
Gara Gara Drinks!?
▶Ayase
Gah! I already swallowed some!
   ▶Reiji
I'm not tired or anything. I just wanna
hurry up and go.
   ▶Little girl
Until lately, we just had to look out for
demons when the girl in black showed up.
▶Little girl
But now I'm nervous... They've been
roaming around without the girl...
  ▶Little girl
Everyone's scared of the demons, but I
don't think we need to worry.
▶Little girl
I just have this feeling that they won't
attack us.
   ▶Clerk
Do you kids know my idiot son?
▶Clerk
A cute girl transferred into his class,
and he can't stand the sight of her.
▶Clerk
Hm? Oh, yes, medicine... right.
▶Clerk
Hey, if you open that door, all the frogs
I keep will come rushing out!
▶Clerk
Hahah! You fell for it!▶Bizarre-looking man
My name is Igor... I am delighted to
make your acquaintance.
▶Igor
This place exists between dream and
reality, mind and matter...
▶Igor
It's been quite some time since we last
had a guest.
▶Igor
This is a room that only those bound by
a "contract" may enter...
▶Igor
From this day forth, you will be our
guest in this Velvet Room.
▶Igor
Your destiny will require you to hone
your power...
▶Igor
And for that, you will inevitably
require our help.
▶Igor
The Velvet Room is also known as the
room of Personas.
▶Igor
A Persona is a side of you that shows
itself when you face the world...
▶Igor
Think of it as a facade of protection
you wear to face hardships in life.
▶Igor
Hm... Perhaps that may have been rather
difficult to understand...
▶Igor
To battle opponents that cannot be
dealt with by human strength alone...
▶Igor
We in this room will lend you inhuman
power... The power of demons...
▶Igor
Now then. Allow me to explain my role
here...
▶Igor
I will assist you in giving birth to
new Personas.
▶Igor
The demons contained within the |ԏspell
cards|  you hold will be fused as one...
▶Igor
Thereby creating a new Persona.
▶Igor
Should you find yourselves with these
cards, please do bring them here.
  ▶Igor
Welcome to the Velvet Room...
   ▶Igor
What is it you desire?
▶Igor
Well then, what would you like
to know?Ԡ
   ▶Igor
I'm afraid you don't have enough |ԏspell
cards|  to give birth to a new Persona.
▶Igor
Alas, we cannot look after any more
Personas.
   ▶Igor
What would you like to do?Ԟ
▶Igor
Well then... Farewell...
▶Igor
If it's new Personas you want, I shall
fuse and create them for you.
▶Igor
First, though, I must summon demons to
fuse together into a Persona.
▶Igor
And for that, a certain type of card
is necessary.
▶Igor
You see, these cards are inscribed with
demon-summoning spells.
▶Igor
They are known as spell cards, and all
demons carry one.
▶Igor
Thus, in order to perform a fusion, I
will need you to gather spell cards.
▶Igor
Go forth, negotiate with demons,
and bring these spell cards back here.
▶Igor
Combat is not the only way to deal
with demons... Do you understand?
▶Igor
And not all demons are necessarily
wishing for a fight...
 ▶Igor
It isn't enough merely to fuse a new
Persona in order to make it your own...
▶Igor
There is rather more to it than that,
I'm afraid.
▶Igor
You must take a Persona onto yourself
in order to use its power.
▶Igor
Each of you is capable of holding up
to three Personas.
▶Igor
A newly-fused Persona will be entrusted
into my care.
▶Igor
By all means let me know when you
would like to take on new Personas.
▶Igor
But I can only look after 16 Personas
at a time, mind you.
▶Igor
There are as many Personas as there are
personalities... an infinite variety.
▶Igor
Each has its own form and substance,
to be used according to the situation.
▶Igor
If you can master that principle,
you will make a fine Persona-user.
▶Igor
Each of you can take on as many as
three Personas at once.
▶Igor
Of the three, only one can be actively
invoked during battle.
▶Igor
To invoke a Persona is to summon it
in combat.
▶Igor
The remaining two will remain on
standby...
▶Igor
Ready to be assumed at any time
during battle.
▶Igor
Different active Personas will grant
you different abilities.
▶Igor
Without the power of Persona, you are
no different than an ordinary human...
▶Igor
You will be powerless before the arcane
might of the demons' spells.
▶Igor
If by chance you were hit by a spell in
that state, you would be struck down.
▶Igor
But by taking on a Persona, your defense
against spells is considerably enhanced.
▶Igor
For some, it may also confer strength,
or increase luck for others.
▶Igor
This, too, is the power of Persona.
▶Igor
Though they are called Personas, each
is a hidden side of yourself.
▶Igor
I suggest you examine your status
carefully after assuming one.
▶Igor
That way, you can see which of your
qualities have changed.
▶Igor
At first, you will be unable to harness
your Persona's powers to the fullest.
▶Igor
But the more you invoke a Persona,
the more powers it will grant you.
▶Igor
As your Persona learns new skills, you
will have more options in battle.
▶Igor
Even if your Persona learns a powerful
skill, the SP required remains constant.
▶Igor
You will grow in combat, but do not
forget that your Personas grow as well.
▶Igor
Pardon me for being nosy, but...
▶Igor
Personas have eight levels of growth.
You should try to develop them fully.
▶Igor
I'm sure that there will be an ample
reward for doing so...
▶Igor
You might also be interested to know
about various factors in fusion.
▶Igor
For example, even when creating the
same Persona...
▶Igor
The combination of spell cards, the
affinities of the demons used...
▶Igor
The position of Terra and Luna, and any
essences added into the mix...
▶Igor
All of these factor into the resultant
Persona. And one more thing...
▶Igor
You may also add an item into the
fusion to trigger a change.
▶Igor
There are some items for which the
result is easily predictable...
▶Igor
But sometimes, even I will be unable
to guess at what may happen.
▶Igor
Should that come about, I do hope that
you'll pardon me.
▶Igor
But make no mistake, I do believe it
is worth trying...
▶Igor
I suggest gems for obtaining a higher-
or lower-ranked fusion within an order.
▶Igor
As for the other items' effects, you
should experiment for yourself.▶Maki
It's nice coming here. I feel like I'm
back to being a normal high schooler.
▶Maki
We're going to the forest, right?
I wonder what this key is...
  ▶Maki
Let's hurry back to that castle.
▶Nanjo
It won't do to be too hasty. In the end,
going one step at a time is quickest.
 ▶Nanjo
I'm not wild about the idea, but let's
go to the subway with this Expel Mirror.
▶Mark
What, no burgers or fries or shakes
at all? Lame!
▶Mark
What's that clerk talkin' all big for
when they have nothin' to sell!?
 ▶Mark
We can't trust that weird guy. But should
we look for this Expel Mirror anyways?
▶Elly
I never really used to hang out anywhere
after school.
▶Elly
But this is quite diverting!
  ▶Elly
Let's go to the shrine.
▶Elly
I'm very curious to see who could be
waiting for us there!
   ▶Brown
Wait, this is a fast food joint, and they
don't have any food? What the hell!?
▶Brown
Urrrgh, I'm soooo hungry!
   ▶Brown
It's about time we went to check out
that shrine.
  ▶Ayase
Doesn't look like my friends are here.
 ▶Ayase
C'mon, let's go to the shrine.
▶Ayase
They might have like, night stalls there.
...I wanna have a candied apple.
▶Reiji
I hate it here. Something about this
place makes my skin crawl.
▶Reiji
Aren't we going to the shrine?
That Tsutomu guy ain't lying.
   ▶Clerk
Sorry, we're all out of food!
▶Clerk
But if you take a break here, it'll clear
your heads so you remember what to do.
 ▶Area man
I accidentally ran smack into a demon
yesterday...
▶Area man
But just when I was sure it was staring
right at me, it walked away.
▶Area man
It was like... it was looking for
someone in particular.
▶Little girl
You guys seem different. I don't know
exactly how to explain it...
   ▶Little girl
You're a good guy, I can tell. I'm sure
your friends think so, too.
  ▶Little girl
You've been doing some pretty bad stuff
behind people's backs, huh?
▶Little girl
Don't forget, actions have consequences.
You might be hurting people...▶Maki
That's a cute mask! I want to hang it
up in my room.
▶Nanjo
Don't let them trick you into buying
anything that seems suspicious.
   ▶Mark
Y'know, I've been wondering about the
relationship between those two...
 ▶Elly
This is so pretty! Isn't it a Japanese
ornament that brings good luck?
  ▶Brown
Is this... a beckoning dog? That doesn't
seem right somehow...
 ▶Ayase
I want this one! C'mon, buy it for me!
 ▶Reiji
The clerks are suspicious... but their
stock is even more suspicious.
  ▶Area man
There've been more demons lately,
I've noticed.
▶Area man
But they seem different from the demons
that girl in black had with her.
 ▶Turunkhamen
Hohoho... Welcome. What manner of goods
do you require?
  ▶Khamenturun
Hohohoho... I love gems more than
anything in this world.
▶Khamenturun
I'll exchange my special treasures for
your gems. Would you like to trade?▶Maki
I wonder if she has a thing for frogs...
▶Nanjo
I wonder if the day will come when our
convenience stores sell weapons too.
▶Mark
Tch, all they got is weapons. Not even
a magazine rack...
   ▶Elly
I wonder what used to be here...
▶Brown
Check out this art! It's hilarious!
...Huh? It's supposed to be serious?
   ▶Ayase
Okay, don't tell me... It's... Uh...?
  ▶Reiji
It looks like those Nazca lines.
   ▶Clerk
Hi! How's everyone doing? Welcome to
Yin&Yan!
▶Clerk
Wanna buy something?
 ▶Clerk
Uh-oh... You're not a robber, are you?
I don't like bad boys, heehee.
  ▶Customer
Have you met our Harem Queen yet?
▶Customer
The Queen is very sensitive!
▶Customer
Listen to me... Don't do anything that
might hurt our Queen's feelings!
▶Customer
I heard the Queen's gone! Ahhh...
At last, I can relax!▶Maki
We're going to see this Queen, huh?
I hope she's not too scary...
   ▶Maki
I don't think Chisato's paintings
are bad...
▶Maki
Chisato and Yosuke were definitely
meant for each other.
▶Nanjo
A Queen, eh...? That reminds me. Aki said
something about a "cute girl"...
 ▶Nanjo
I didn't think Chisato would be the Harem
Queen. She fits the role nicely, though.
 ▶Nanjo
We finally have an inkling of Kandori's
location. A castle, though...? Hmph.
   ▶Nanjo
I never thought I'd find myself venturing
into the "haunted mansion" at this age.
▶Nanjo
Such things were forbidden to me when
I was a child...
   ▶Mark
Even the armor shop fits right into
this crazy town.
▶Mark
...Be careful around Maki, okay?
▶Mark
Y'know, did it seem to you like what we
did wasn't exactly necessary?
   ▶Elly
So afros are the latest trend... I wonder
if I should try one myself.
   ▶Elly
I can sympathize somewhat with Chisato.
 ▶Elly
Chisato and I aren't all that unlike
each other. Does that surprise you...?
 ▶Brown
I hear life is easy if the Queen
likes you!
▶Brown
Just leave her to me! No woman can
resist my charms!
   ▶Brown
That blue stuff around Chisato's eyes...
It creeped me out!
▶Brown
That stuck-up brat's been living in a
castle!? To hell with that!
▶Brown
Castles are for sophisticated guys
like me!
  ▶Ayase
A Queen, huh? I wanna be a Queen...
▶Ayase
Chisato doesn't even know how bad the
real Maki's suffering...
 ▶Ayase
Chisato's already so pretty. What's she
bitching about? I like the way I look.
▶Ayase
I'm not, like, super beautiful, but I have
cute freckles and an interesting face.
   ▶Reiji
Whatever's going on, we can't get
anything done unless we find a way out.
  ▶Reiji
Tch... You and Maki are such easy marks.
   ▶Reiji
Relying on other people's advice is no
use at times like these...
▶Reiji
You have to make your own decision.
  ▶Clerk
Would you like to become beautiful and
strong like the Queen with our weapons?
 ▶Clerk
You can rely on our goods! They're a
definite must for survival in this world!
 ▶Customer
Well, as long as we're all trapped in
this market anyways...
▶Customer
Might as well butter up the Queen and
enjoy our stay!
   ▶Customer
We don't have to suck up to the Queen
anymore, right?
▶Customer
Well... I'll miss it. A little.▶Maki
Um, <FirstName>...? 
Never mind... it's nothing.
▶Nanjo
The black market, eh...? ԺIt's a good fit
for this lawless town.
  ▶Mark
It's good to see the doctor hasn't
changed a bit.
   ▶Elly
I'm relieved that the doctor's just the
way he always is.
   ▶Brown
So the doc's the same as ever...
▶Brown
I was worried what we'd do if he turned
out to be some skinhead with an eyepatch!
 ▶Ayase
He's... He's not gonna give us shots,
is he...?
  ▶Reiji
Huh. I was expecting the doctor to be...
stranger, I guess.
▶Nurse
The reason I'm so happy is all because
of the Harem Queen.
▶Nurse
Let's all give thanks to the Queen!
Hooray for the Queen!
   ▶Nurse
It was never the Queen who made me happy!
▶Nurse
But now who am I supposed to thank?▶Doctor
What, did you catch a cold? Then go
sleep it off!
 ▶Doctor
Now, what can I do for you?ԙ
 ▶Doctor
Alright... For all of you together...
 ▶Doctor
My fee is 1,࿌00 yen. Well? 
  ▶Doctor
Hm. Then let's get you patched up.
▶Doctor
There, that should do it.
▶Doctor
Anything else you need? 
  ▶Doctor
Well, I can't treat patients who can't
pay. Come back when you have the fee.
  ▶Doctor
I hope you don't run into trouble later
because you cheaped out on treatment.
 ▶Doctor
All right. If anything else comes up,
I recommend you see me immediately.
 ▶Doctor
My time is valuable. If you don't have
any business here, then take a hike.▶Maki
This Sennen Mannen-Do is very weird...
  ▶Nanjo
This market seems devoid of normal shops.
  ▶Mark
I guess the Sennen Mannen-Do in this town
doesn't sell sweets.
  ▶Elly
How exotic! What a wonderful store!
 ▶Brown
This jar's pretty neat. Hey <Nickname>,
could you buy this for me as a gift?
▶Ayase
Did you talk to the clerks here?
Their makeup is like, really weird!
   ▶Reiji
...Is this place haunted?
  ▶Turunkhamen
Hohoho... Welcome. What manner of goods
do you require?
  ▶Khamenturun
Hohohoho... I love gems more than
anything in this world.
▶Khamenturun
I'll exchange my special treasures for
your gems. Would you like to trade?
   ▶Customer
If I was a beautiful youth who looked like
a stray dog, the Queen would've liked me!
▶Customer
Then I could've kicked back at the palace
instead of living in this dump.
   ▶Customer
The men in the harem all had to swear
their loyalty to the Queen, right?
▶Customer
That's so lame...
▶Customer
I'm gonna live the way I want, without
submitting to anyone.▶Maki
This store's owned by the uncle of a
friend of mine named Tadashi.
▶Maki
Tadashi doesn't get along with Tamaki,
this transfer student.
▶Maki
He won't speak even one word to her.
 ▶Nanjo
...If you want to recover HP then use...
▶Nanjo
Fine! I surrender! Here, <FirstName>,
you sing along too!
   ▶Mark
Tadashi's uncle, huh? This place doesn't
seem that different from our version.
  ▶Elly
I don't mean to be rude, but I do wonder
how effective the medicine here is...
  ▶Brown
Hey... That guy's hair... That's not
a wig, is it?
 ▶Ayase
Baby stuff is all so cute. I just like
looking at it.
  ▶Reiji
What a maniac...
   ▶Clerk
Welcome to Satomi Tadashi! Feel free to
call me "the Satster"!
▶Clerk
Now, on to business!
▶Customer
I'm a little down in the dumps today.
▶Customer
At times like these, all I can do is go
to the bar and discuss the Queen's art.
▶Customer
The Queen's finally gone! This calls for
a drink or five!
   ▶Clerk
You can't go in there. Nope, not even
a peek!▶Maki
Um... <FirstName>... To tell the truth,
I...
  ▶Nanjo
Hmm... It's necessary to enjoy oneself
sometimes, I suppose.
   ▶Mark
All right! Get ready to be dazzled by
my poker skills!
  ▶Elly
I detest this sort of place! The air's
so foul!
 ▶Brown
Heheh! It's all about the casinos!
▶Brown
By the way, <Nickname>... What do you
think of those guys at the counter...?
 ▶Ayase
Hey, <FirstName>! Stock up on coins and
buy me some earrings!
▶Ayase
Whaaat!? All they have is stuff like
Para Stones? What a letdown!
  ▶Reiji
Hmph... Ridiculous.
▶Clerk
Hiiii! SO nice to see you!
▶Clerk
If you're looking to exchange money for
coins, I'm your man.
▶Clerk
Won't you purchase some coins? Hmmmm? 
▶Clerk
I can exchange your coins for items, if
that's what you're in the mood for...
▶Clerk
Wanna see what I've got? 
   ▶Customer
You're not wearing any moles. Did you
just get here?
▶Customer
The fashion right now is to follow the
Queen's example with lots of moles.
  ▶Customer
Oops, I forgot to take off my moles.
Man, those things were ugly!

In this version of poker, you can
change your hand once.
You will be dealt five cards at the
outset.
Use the directional buttons to move to
a card, and press the íȺႨȺùȺࠁ buttons
to hold that card.
Once you have chosen which cards to
hold, press the R button to re-draw
the remaining cards.
If you have a valid hand after the
second draw, you win.
The higher the bet, the larger the
payout for a winning hand will be.
If you win, you can bet the amount
you just won on an Extra Game.
If you'd rather not risk it, choose
"Take Winnings."
There are three types of Extra Game.
Each round you win doubles your
earnings.
By winning the Extra Game, you can
wager up to 1,000,000 coins.
But be careful; one mistake and you'll
lose it all.
<Extra Game 1>
ٰHigh & Low
One card is shown, with four other
cards left face-down.
You must guess which face-down card is
higher than the shown card.
If the card you draw has the same
number as the shown card, the game is
a draw and you may try again.
<Extra Game 2>
ٰBig & Small
One card is shown and one card is
face-down.
You must guess whether the face-down
card is bigger or smaller than the
shown card.
If both cards are equal, you lose,
so be careful.
<Extra Game 3>
ٰRed & Black
One face-down card is dealt.
If you think it's ॵ or ࣚ, choose Red.
If you think it's ਏ or ࢼ, choose Black.
If the color you chose matches the
card's color, you win.

This is a one-on-one-game of blackjack
against the dealer.
The computer acts as the dealer.
Two cards are dealt to the player and
the dealer at the outset.
One of the dealer's two cards will be
kept face-down.
If the dealer's shown card is an ace,
you may place an insurance bet.
The insurance mechanic will be explained
at the end of these rules.
First, compare your cards to the dealer's
to decide whether to draw another card.
If you decide to draw, select Hit.
If not, select Stand.
You may draw up to 7 cards as long as
their total value remains 21 or lower.
The following circumstances will result
in an automatic Stand:
-Your initial draw is blackjack.
-The total of the cards drawn after
Hitting is 21.
-You draw seven cards.
-The cards' total value surpasses 21,
resulting in a bust.
2 through 10 are face value. J through
K are worth 10, and A is worth either
1 or 11.
After the player Stands, the dealer
will draw cards.
If your total is larger than the
dealer's without surpassing 21...
Or if the dealer busts, you win.
If you and the dealer tie, or if both
of you have blackjack, it is a draw,
and your bet will be returned to you.
Besides Hit and Stand, the player can
also choose to Double Down or Split.
 <D. Down> 
This is only an option while you still
have two cards in your hand.
You may double your bet under the
condition that you only Hit once.
This option will be unavailable if you
have fewer coins than the bet would be.
If you Double Down and beat the dealer,
your winnings will be doubled.
<Split>
You may Split if both of your initial
cards are the same value.
Your hand will be split, with a second
bet covering the other hand.
This option will be unavailable if you
have fewer coins than the bet would be.
Even after a Split, you may Double Down
on either or both hands.
However, if you split, even with a
combination of A with 10 through K...
It will be counted as 21 without being
considered blackjack.

ႬAbout insuranceႭ
An insurance bet is much as it sounds...
It can only be placed if the dealer's
first card is an ace.
Select Yes to place an insurance bet,
and No to decline.
If you select No, the game progresses
normally.
If you select Yes, you must first
pay half your bet as insurance.
If the dealer's second card is 10
through K, forming blackjack...
The initial bet is forfeited.
However...
The insurance bet will pay out at
3 to 1, and the game will end.
If the dealer's card is A through 9,
the insurance is lost and the game
progresses normally.
Since Ⴤ decks of cards are used in this
game, there is a chance that two or more
identical cards will be dealt.

 Winning the game:
If your hand is larger than the dealer's
without going over 21...
Or if the dealer busts, you win.

10 through K. (Automatically Stands.)
If you chose to Split, this will not
be counted as blackjack but is 21.
6 Cards:
If you choose Stand when you've drawn
six cards without surpassing 21.
7 Cards:
If you've drawn seven cards without

This slot machine consists of ࿌
big reels and 16 small reels.
The number of ways to line up a win
increases with the size of your bet.
You can bet up to ৎ coins.
Bets 1, 2, ࿌, and 6 are for the
horizontal lines,while 3, Ⴤ, 7,
and ৎ are for the vertical lines.
Bets ࿌ through ৎ also add two ways
to line up a win per bet.
When the game begins, the big and small
reels will all start to spin.
Once the reels have spun enough,
the small reels will stop. (The big
reels will continue to spin.)
Press the í, Ⴈ, ù, and ࠁ buttons to
rotate the corresponding reels.
Adjust the small reels so that it will
be easier to line up a pattern.
When you have finished, press the
R button to stop the big reels.
If three or more of a symbol are lined
up along one of your bets, you win.
Up to five symbols can cross bets 1
through Ⴤ, and up to four can cross
bets ࿌ through ৎ.
When the symbols on the big reels match
diagonally, in all four corners, or all
five at once...

screen, and you predict the outcome.
You can bet on eleven rolls, from 2
to 12, and you may bet on as many rolls
per game as you wish.
However, you may bet a maximum of 100
coins on any given roll.
If you bet on the correct roll, a
multiplier determines your winnings.
You can also stake your winnings on
an Extra Game.
In the Extra Game, you do not predict
the outcome of the roll...
Instead, any roll other than 7 wins.
The amount you win differs depending on
the roll.
If the roll is 7, the Extra Game ends

The closer the roll is to 7, the lower
the multiplier. This is because rolls
close to 7 appear more frequently.
Thus, the safe bet is on rolls close
to 7, with rolls like 2 and 12 being
riskier.
In the Extra Game, if a roll of 7
comes up, you lose all your winnings.

Young ones... Your presence is welcome.
 ▶Agastya Tree
Will you inscribe your story on me? 
   ▶Agastya Tree
Take care on your journey, young ones...▶Bizarre-looking man
My name is Igor... I am delighted to
make your acquaintance.
▶Igor
This place exists between dream and
reality, mind and matter...
▶Igor
It's been quite some time since we last
had a guest.
▶Igor
This is a room that only those bound by
a "contract" may enter...
▶Igor
From this day forth, you will be our
guest in this Velvet Room.
▶Igor
Your destiny will require you to hone
your power...
▶Igor
And for that, you will inevitably
require our help.
▶Igor
The Velvet Room is also known as the
room of Personas.
▶Igor
A Persona is a side of you that shows
itself when you face the world...
▶Igor
Think of it as a facade of protection
you wear to face hardships in life.
▶Igor
Hm... Perhaps that may have been rather
difficult to understand...
▶Igor
To battle opponents that cannot be
dealt with by human strength alone...
▶Igor
We in this room will lend you inhuman
power... The power of demons...
▶Igor
Now then. Allow me to explain my role
here...
▶Igor
I will assist you in giving birth to
new Personas.
▶Igor
The demons contained within the |ԏspell
cards|  you hold will be fused as one...
▶Igor
Thereby creating a new Persona.
▶Igor
Should you find yourselves with these
cards, please do bring them here.
  ▶Igor
Welcome to the Velvet Room...
   ▶Igor
What is it you desire?
▶Igor
Well then, what would you like
to know?Ԡ
   ▶Igor
I'm afraid you don't have enough |ԏspell
cards|  to give birth to a new Persona.
▶Igor
Alas, we cannot look after any more
Personas.
   ▶Igor
What would you like to do?Ԟ
▶Igor
Well then... Farewell...
▶Igor
If it's new Personas you want, I shall
fuse and create them for you.
▶Igor
First, though, I must summon demons to
fuse together into a Persona.
▶Igor
And for that, a certain type of card
is necessary.
▶Igor
You see, these cards are inscribed with
demon-summoning spells.
▶Igor
They are known as spell cards, and all
demons carry one.
▶Igor
Thus, in order to perform a fusion, I
will need you to gather spell cards.
▶Igor
Go forth, negotiate with demons,
and bring these spell cards back here.
▶Igor
Combat is not the only way to deal
with demons... Do you understand?
▶Igor
And not all demons are necessarily
wishing for a fight...
 ▶Igor
It isn't enough merely to fuse a new
Persona in order to make it your own...
▶Igor
There is rather more to it than that,
I'm afraid.
▶Igor
You must take a Persona onto yourself
in order to use its power.
▶Igor
Each of you is capable of holding up
to three Personas.
▶Igor
A newly-fused Persona will be entrusted
into my care.
▶Igor
By all means let me know when you
would like to take on new Personas.
▶Igor
But I can only look after 16 Personas
at a time, mind you.
▶Igor
There are as many Personas as there are
personalities... an infinite variety.
▶Igor
Each has its own form and substance,
to be used according to the situation.
▶Igor
If you can master that principle,
you will make a fine Persona-user.
▶Igor
Each of you can take on as many as
three Personas at once.
▶Igor
Of the three, only one can be actively
invoked during battle.
▶Igor
To invoke a Persona is to summon it
in combat.
▶Igor
The remaining two will remain on
standby...
▶Igor
Ready to be assumed at any time
during battle.
▶Igor
Different active Personas will grant
you different abilities.
▶Igor
Without the power of Persona, you are
no different than an ordinary human...
▶Igor
You will be powerless before the arcane
might of the demons' spells.
▶Igor
If by chance you were hit by a spell in
that state, you would be struck down.
▶Igor
But by taking on a Persona, your defense
against spells is considerably enhanced.
▶Igor
For some, it may also confer strength,
or increase luck for others.
▶Igor
This, too, is the power of Persona.
▶Igor
Though they are called Personas, each
is a hidden side of yourself.
▶Igor
I suggest you examine your status
carefully after assuming one.
▶Igor
That way, you can see which of your
qualities have changed.
▶Igor
At first, you will be unable to harness
your Persona's powers to the fullest.
▶Igor
But the more you invoke a Persona,
the more powers it will grant you.
▶Igor
As your Persona learns new skills, you
will have more options in battle.
▶Igor
Even if your Persona learns a powerful
skill, the SP required remains constant.
▶Igor
You will grow in combat, but do not
forget that your Personas grow as well.
▶Igor
Pardon me for being nosy, but...
▶Igor
Personas have eight levels of growth.
You should try to develop them fully.
▶Igor
I'm sure that there will be an ample
reward for doing so...
▶Igor
You might also be interested to know
about various factors in fusion.
▶Igor
For example, even when creating the
same Persona...
▶Igor
The combination of spell cards, the
affinities of the demons used...
▶Igor
The position of Terra and Luna, and any
essences added into the mix...
▶Igor
All of these factor into the resultant
Persona. And one more thing...
▶Igor
You may also add an item into the
fusion to trigger a change.
▶Igor
There are some items for which the
result is easily predictable...
▶Igor
But sometimes, even I will be unable
to guess at what may happen.
▶Igor
Should that come about, I do hope that
you'll pardon me.
▶Igor
But make no mistake, I do believe it
is worth trying...
▶Igor
I suggest gems for obtaining a higher-
or lower-ranked fusion within an order.
▶Igor
As for the other items' effects, you
should experiment for yourself.▶Maki

▶Nanjo
Is she taunting us by trapping us here?
Or is she buying time?

People who suppress their emotions will
eventually find that they explode.

Dammit... All this crap about the palace
and junk ain't funny!
  ▶Mark
What was that brat up to, using a girl
like Chisato?

I wonder if she's that confident in her
own paintings.
  ▶Elly
Doesn't the road seem shorter now that
we've traveled it once?

I think... I'm a little jealous.
   ▶Reiji
Worrying about crap we can't figure out
won't get us anywhere!
▶Reiji
What we gotta do now is find this Queen.
▶Reiji
You'll never survive in this world if
you let little things like this get you.
▶Reiji
There's plenty of people out there going
through worse shit than this.
  ▶Reiji
What, did you think I'd be touched or
something?
   ▶Young man
This is our Queen's fabulous painting.
▶Young man
Our Queen's a great artist, and beautiful
too. I'm not so bad-looking either, eh?
   ▶Young man
So tell me, what's so great about this
painting anyway?
▶Young man
The "Queen" acted all high and mighty,
but I'm ten times more attractive!
  > It's the piece the Queen supposedly
painted. You feel like you've seen this
style somewhere...
  ▶Maki
Hey... I know this painting!
It's Chisato's...!
 ▶Mark
What, Chisato Kasai's? I thought they
said she went missing.
▶Mark
Wait... Chisato's painting is here,
and they're saying it's the Queen's...?
 ▶Maki
But why?
▶Maki
Does this mean... Chisato is being held
captive by the Harem Queen?▶Maki
We need to hurry, or you won't be able
to go back!
  ▶Nanjo
Kandori... What's his scheme...!?
  ▶Mark
Come to think of it...
▶Mark
The old man who made the machine is the
only one who owned up to what he did.
 ▶Elly
This mansion has such a deliciously
macabre atmosphere to it...
 ▶Brown
Not that I care, but this is one
creepy place!
 ▶Ayase
You hear a woman crying? I've been like,
hearing it this whole time.
   ▶Reiji
Don't any of these people regret what
they've done?
▶Scientist
The dimensional passage on the third
floor was unstable...
▶Scientist
If we don't hurry, it could become
completely unusable!
 ▶Scientist
Only Dr. Nicholai realized Kandori's
true nature...
▶Scientist
Well, I suppose it's too late now...
▶Scientist
But we should have stopped Kandori by
any means available while we could.
 ▶Scientist
Going after Kandori? It's too late...
His dreadful scheme is in motion by now.▶Maki
These guys seem like they're in the
same boat as you, <FirstName>.
▶Nanjo
Rumor has it that a woman's ghost haunts
this place.
   ▶Mark
Sure, it's a haunted house... But I
didn't think it had a real ghost!
   ▶Elly
How wonderful! A real, visible ghost!
Let's hurry and see it!
   ▶Brown
It'd be cool if the ghost was really
pretty... Nah, I'll pass anyway!
  ▶Ayase
I wish I'd, like, brought a camera!
We could take ghost photos and sell 'em!
   ▶Reiji
Scientists who are scared of ghosts?
Kandori sure can pick 'em...
  ▶Scientist
In truth, we're not from this world...
▶Scientist
The trouble is, we can't go into the room
with the machine that will get us home.
▶Scientist
Could you please take a look for us?
  ▶Scientist
Dammit!
▶Scientist
Kandori used us for our research and
then left us here!
▶Scientist
We can hear the ghost of a woman crying
in that room!
▶Scientist
The others say ghosts don't exist, but
none of them will actually go in...▶Agastya Tree
Young ones... Your presence is welcome.
 ▶Agastya Tree
Will you inscribe your story on me? 
   ▶Agastya Tree
Take care on your journey, young ones...▶Scientist
Heeheehee! The hammer of judgement will
come down on this species of fools!
▶Scientist
Heeheehee!
 ▶Scientist
I feel as if I had this incredibly
senseless mindset...
▶Scientist
Mankind needs no future!
   ▶Scientist
We must preserve mankind's future!
Isn't that right, everyone!?
▶Scientist
Why was mankind created to begin with?
 ▶Scientist
I haven't thought about the reason for
mankind's existence since childhood.
▶Scientist
I could never afford to wonder about
such things...
▶Maki
Have they all been brainwashed?
 ▶Maki
I'm glad those weird radio waves stopped.
   ▶Mark
These fools are crazy.
  ▶Mark
Looks like they snapped out of it.
  ▶Nanjo
We must stop Kandori at once!
  ▶Nanjo
The reason why we're born... Hmmm.
 ▶Ayase
Whoa! They're like, totally out of it!
 ▶Ayase
I'm glad everyone's back to normal.

Oh crap... oh crap...!

The key to the game is to determine
where a hit (H) is on both the row

It's best to mark places where both
the row and the column are hits.

In this version of poker, you can
change your hand once.
You will be dealt five cards at the
outset.
Use the directional buttons to move to
a card, and press the íȺႨȺùȺࠁ buttons
to hold that card.
Once you have chosen which cards to
hold, press the R button to re-draw
the remaining cards.
If you have a valid hand after the
second draw, you win.
The higher the bet, the larger the
payout for a winning hand will be.
If you win, you can bet the amount
you just won on an Extra Game.
If you'd rather not risk it, choose
"Take Winnings."
There are three types of Extra Game.
Each round you win doubles your
earnings.
By winning the Extra Game, you can
wager up to 1,000,000 coins.
But be careful; one mistake and you'll
lose it all.
<Extra Game 1>
ٰHigh & Low
One card is shown, with four other
cards left face-down.
You must guess which face-down card is
higher than the shown card.
If the card you draw has the same
number as the shown card, the game is
a draw and you may try again.
<Extra Game 2>
ٰBig & Small
One card is shown and one card is
face-down.
You must guess whether the face-down
card is bigger or smaller than the
shown card.
If both cards are equal, you lose,
so be careful.
<Extra Game 3>
ٰRed & Black
One face-down card is dealt.
If you think it's ॵ or ࣚ, choose Red.
If you think it's ਏ or ࢼ, choose Black.
If the color you chose matches the
card's color, you win.

This is a one-on-one-game of blackjack
against the dealer.
The computer acts as the dealer.
Two cards are dealt to the player and
the dealer at the outset.
One of the dealer's two cards will be
kept face-down.
If the dealer's shown card is an ace,
you may place an insurance bet.
The insurance mechanic will be explained
at the end of these rules.
First, compare your cards to the dealer's
to decide whether to draw another card.
If you decide to draw, select Hit.
If not, select Stand.
You may draw up to 7 cards as long as
their total value remains 21 or lower.
The following circumstances will result
in an automatic Stand:
-Your initial draw is blackjack.
-The total of the cards drawn after
Hitting is 21.
-You draw seven cards.
-The cards' total value surpasses 21,
resulting in a bust.
2 through 10 are face value. J through
K are worth 10, and A is worth either
1 or 11.
After the player Stands, the dealer
will draw cards.
If your total is larger than the
dealer's without surpassing 21...
Or if the dealer busts, you win.
If you and the dealer tie, or if both
of you have blackjack, it is a draw,
and your bet will be returned to you.
Besides Hit and Stand, the player can
also choose to Double Down or Split.
 <D. Down> 
This is only an option while you still
have two cards in your hand.
You may double your bet under the
condition that you only Hit once.
This option will be unavailable if you
have fewer coins than the bet would be.
If you Double Down and beat the dealer,
your winnings will be doubled.
<Split>
You may Split if both of your initial
cards are the same value.
Your hand will be split, with a second
bet covering the other hand.
This option will be unavailable if you
have fewer coins than the bet would be.
Even after a Split, you may Double Down
on either or both hands.
However, if you split, even with a
combination of A with 10 through K...
It will be counted as 21 without being
considered blackjack.

ႬAbout insuranceႭ
An insurance bet is much as it sounds...
It can only be placed if the dealer's
first card is an ace.
Select Yes to place an insurance bet,
and No to decline.
If you select No, the game progresses
normally.
If you select Yes, you must first
pay half your bet as insurance.
If the dealer's second card is 10
through K, forming blackjack...
The initial bet is forfeited.
However...
The insurance bet will pay out at
3 to 1, and the game will end.
If the dealer's card is A through 9,
the insurance is lost and the game
progresses normally.
Since Ⴤ decks of cards are used in this
game, there is a chance that two or more
identical cards will be dealt.

 Winning the game:
If your hand is larger than the dealer's
without going over 21...
Or if the dealer busts, you win.
Blackjack:
An A combined with a second card of
10 through K. (Automatically Stands.)
If you chose to Split, this will not
be counted as blackjack but is 21.
6 Cards:
If you choose Stand when you've drawn
six cards without surpassing 21.
7 Cards:
If you've drawn seven cards without
surpassing 21. (Automatically Stands.)
ॵȺࢼȺࣚ A & J:
If you have blackjack of A and J
and the cards' suit is ॵ, ࢼ, or ࣚ.

This slot machine consists of ࿌
big reels and 16 small reels.
The number of ways to line up a win
increases with the size of your bet.
You can bet up to ৎ coins.
Bets 1, 2, ࿌, and 6 are for the
horizontal lines,while 3, Ⴤ, 7,
and ৎ are for the vertical lines.
Bets ࿌ through ৎ also add two ways
to line up a win per bet.
When the game begins, the big and small
reels will all start to spin.
Once the reels have spun enough,
the small reels will stop. (The big
reels will continue to spin.)
Press the í, Ⴈ, ù, and ࠁ buttons to
rotate the corresponding reels.
Adjust the small reels so that it will
be easier to line up a pattern.
When you have finished, press the
R button to stop the big reels.
If three or more of a symbol are lined
up along one of your bets, you win.
Up to five symbols can cross bets 1
through Ⴤ, and up to four can cross
bets ࿌ through ৎ.
When the symbols on the big reels match
diagonally, in all four corners, or all
five at once...
You win regardless of which lines you
bet on.
Earnings for hits on the big reels
increase according to the number of
bets you made.

   Different slot machines have different
patterns and odds.
It's best to try out different machines
rather than concentrating on one.
Be careful not to forget to rotate the
small reels during the game.
Careful adjustment of the small reels
is key to maximizing your payout.
If you begin the game with fewer bets,
you may face greater losses when it
matters most.
For best results, always play the game
with the full eight bets.

In this game, two dice are rolled on
screen, and you predict the outcome.
You can bet on eleven rolls, from 2
to 12, and you may bet on as many rolls
per game as you wish.
However, you may bet a maximum of 100
coins on any given roll.
If you bet on the correct roll, a
multiplier determines your winnings.
You can also stake your winnings on
an Extra Game.
In the Extra Game, you do not predict
the outcome of the roll...
Instead, any roll other than 7 wins.
The amount you win differs depending on
the roll.
If the roll is 7, the Extra Game ends
and all your winnings are lost, so be

The closer the roll is to 7, the lower
the multiplier. This is because rolls
close to 7 appear more frequently.
Thus, the safe bet is on rolls close
to 7, with rolls like 2 and 12 being
riskier.
In the Extra Game, if a roll of 7
comes up, you lose all your winnings.
The trick to not losing too much is
not to get greedy and leave with a
reasonable amount.▶Storekeeper

I'm, like, really hungry.
▶Ayase
But I'll deal with it. I mean, Maki's
going through way worse.
   ▶Brown
I'm sick of walking. Then again, now's
not the time to complain, huh?
  ▶Elly
You done shopping?
  ▶Elly
Have you finished your shopping?
▶Reiji
How much longer are you gonna take?▶Clerk
Yikes, things are getting crazy. Well,
my store will stay open.
▶Area man
I feel like someone's going around and
destroying this town...
  ▶Maki
Sorry, Mr. Tadashi...
   ▶Mark
This song's always on when we come here.
It's driving me nuts.
  ▶Nanjo
Ha! I'm finally used to it! Go ahead and
try to brainwash me--it's useless!
▶Ayase
Oooooh, this diaper has cute little frogs
on it! It's soooo cute!
  ▶Brown
Hey, you think this place has love
potions!?
   ▶Elly
Doesn't this place have any normal drugs
for everyday stuff?
▶Elly
Does this store not stock any regular
medicine for everyday situations?
 ▶Reiji
What? Is it weird for me to be looking
at baby stuff?
  ▶Clerk
Hm? Hey, the counter is over here!▶Mannequin
Hi there.
  ▶Area woman
I would've preferred it if this place
stayed the way it was...
▶Maki
The way it was... But no matter how nice
it used to be, it was still a fake.
▶Mark
The real saleslady would probably faint
if she saw this.
▶Nanjo
We could be shopping for a very long
time if we insist on the best...
▶Nanjo
But we should at least be equipped with
the minimum necessary.
   ▶Ayase
Don't they have any armor with, like,
animals and stuff on it?
 ▶Brown
What I need is some armor that looks
badass... They got that here?
 ▶Elly
I guess I can't complain if it's keeping
us alive...
▶Elly
But this stuff really isn't to my taste.
▶Elly
I suppose I shouldn't complain, since it
does protect us from harm...
▶Elly
But I can't help feeling that this
clashes a bit with my style.
▶Reiji
Buy something if you're gonna.▶Clerk
Customers are gods, and you're a customer.
That makes you a god.
▶Clerk
So please fix this town! I'm in a real
fix... I can't restock my goods!
   ▶Little girl
I always had the feeling something wasn't
right with this town.
▶Little girl
Maybe it's natural for weird stuff like
this to happen here.
   ▶Maki
Hmm... He's right. If it wasn't natural
for weird stuff to happen here...
▶Maki
I wouldn't have understood anything.
   ▶Mark
Let's get to the forest!
▶Mark
Let's get to the shrine!
▶Mark
Let's get to the school!
▶Nanjo
Restock...? Say, where does this town
restock its supplies from?
▶Nanjo
Then again, it's no use mulling over
things that won't necessarily make sense.
▶Ayase
I'm soooo hungry! I just gotta lump it,
I guess...
 ▶Brown
They take saying grace a little far here,
don't they? Heeheehee!
   ▶Elly
We need to get a move on, <FirstName>.
▶Elly
We don't have much time to waste,
<FirstName>.
▶Reiji
I'm pretty sure we didn't have any
business here.
▶Reiji
Seriously... You're either a brave man
or an idiot. I don't get you.
▶Reiji
Then again, no matter how you slice it,
you're an interesting guy.▶Doctor
Wish I could find a nurse who was less
of a ditz.
 ▶Doctor
Now, what can I do for you?ԙ
 ▶Doctor
Alright... For all of you together...
 ▶Doctor
My fee is 1,࿌00 yen. Well? 
  ▶Doctor
Hm. Then let's get you patched up.
▶Doctor
There, that should do it.
▶Doctor
Anything else you need? 
  ▶Doctor
Well, I can't treat patients who can't
pay. Come back when you have the fee.
  ▶Doctor
I hope you don't run into trouble later
because you cheaped out on treatment.
 ▶Doctor
All right. If anything else comes up,
I recommend you see me immediately.
 ▶Doctor
My time is valuable. If you don't have
any business here, then take a hike.
   ▶Nurse
Don't let Maki get hurt, got it? She's
like a local hero here!
 ▶Nurse
Oh, you go to the same school as
Maki Sonomura.
▶Nurse
Huh? You're friends with her!? Oooh,
I'm so jealous!
▶Nurse
Hey, could you get me her autograph?
  ▶Maki
I'm no hero or anything... Everyone is
just being made to think that...
 ▶Mark
Maki's a local hero, huh? That's awesome!
Isn't it?
 ▶Nanjo
...This must be rather tedious for Maki
now that she knows the truth.
  ▶Ayase
How come doctors always act so high
and mighty?
▶Brown
Forget my injuries, I need brain pills.
▶Elly
It's tough when people idolize you.
It's a lot to live up to.
   ▶Elly
It's difficult being idolized that way...
You end up having to put on an act.
   ▶Reiji
What's wrong? Hope you're not tired,
'cause we got a long ways to go.▶Bizarre-looking man
My name is Igor... I am delighted to
make your acquaintance.
▶Igor
This place exists between dream and
reality, mind and matter...
▶Igor
It's been quite some time since we last
had a guest.
▶Igor
This is a room that only those bound by
a "contract" may enter...
▶Igor
From this day forth, you will be our
guest in this Velvet Room.
▶Igor
Your destiny will require you to hone
your power...
▶Igor
And for that, you will inevitably
require our help.
▶Igor
The Velvet Room is also known as the
room of Personas.
▶Igor
A Persona is a side of you that shows
itself when you face the world...
▶Igor
Think of it as a facade of protection
you wear to face hardships in life.
▶Igor
Hm... Perhaps that may have been rather
difficult to understand...
▶Igor
To battle opponents that cannot be
dealt with by human strength alone...
▶Igor
We in this room will lend you inhuman
power... The power of demons...
▶Igor
Now then. Allow me to explain my role
here...
▶Igor
I will assist you in giving birth to
new Personas.
▶Igor
The demons contained within the |ԏspell
cards|  you hold will be fused as one...
▶Igor
Thereby creating a new Persona.
▶Igor
Should you find yourselves with these
cards, please do bring them here.
  ▶Igor
Welcome to the Velvet Room...
   ▶Igor
What is it you desire?
▶Igor
Well then, what would you like
to know?Ԡ
   ▶Igor
I'm afraid you don't have enough |ԏspell
cards|  to give birth to a new Persona.
▶Igor
Alas, we cannot look after any more
Personas.
   ▶Igor
What would you like to do?Ԟ
▶Igor
Well then... Farewell...
▶Igor
If it's new Personas you want, I shall
fuse and create them for you.
▶Igor
First, though, I must summon demons to
fuse together into a Persona.
▶Igor
And for that, a certain type of card
is necessary.
▶Igor
You see, these cards are inscribed with
demon-summoning spells.
▶Igor
They are known as spell cards, and all
demons carry one.
▶Igor
Thus, in order to perform a fusion, I
will need you to gather spell cards.
▶Igor
Go forth, negotiate with demons,
and bring these spell cards back here.
▶Igor
Combat is not the only way to deal
with demons... Do you understand?
▶Igor
And not all demons are necessarily
wishing for a fight...
 ▶Igor
It isn't enough merely to fuse a new
Persona in order to make it your own...
▶Igor
There is rather more to it than that,
I'm afraid.
▶Igor
You must take a Persona onto yourself
in order to use its power.
▶Igor
Each of you is capable of holding up
to three Personas.
▶Igor
A newly-fused Persona will be entrusted
into my care.
▶Igor
By all means let me know when you
would like to take on new Personas.
▶Igor
But I can only look after 16 Personas
at a time, mind you.
▶Igor
There are as many Personas as there are
personalities... an infinite variety.
▶Igor
Each has its own form and substance,
to be used according to the situation.
▶Igor
If you can master that principle,
you will make a fine Persona-user.
▶Igor
Each of you can take on as many as
three Personas at once.
▶Igor
Of the three, only one can be actively
invoked during battle.
▶Igor
To invoke a Persona is to summon it
in combat.
▶Igor
The remaining two will remain on
standby...
▶Igor
Ready to be assumed at any time
during battle.
▶Igor
Different active Personas will grant
you different abilities.
▶Igor
Without the power of Persona, you are
no different than an ordinary human...
▶Igor
You will be powerless before the arcane
might of the demons' spells.
▶Igor
If by chance you were hit by a spell in
that state, you would be struck down.
▶Igor
But by taking on a Persona, your defense
against spells is considerably enhanced.
▶Igor
For some, it may also confer strength,
or increase luck for others.
▶Igor
This, too, is the power of Persona.
▶Igor
Though they are called Personas, each
is a hidden side of yourself.
▶Igor
I suggest you examine your status
carefully after assuming one.
▶Igor
That way, you can see which of your
qualities have changed.
▶Igor
At first, you will be unable to harness
your Persona's powers to the fullest.
▶Igor
But the more you invoke a Persona,
the more powers it will grant you.
▶Igor
As your Persona learns new skills, you
will have more options in battle.
▶Igor
Even if your Persona learns a powerful
skill, the SP required remains constant.
▶Igor
You will grow in combat, but do not
forget that your Personas grow as well.
▶Igor
Pardon me for being nosy, but...
▶Igor
Personas have eight levels of growth.
You should try to develop them fully.
▶Igor
I'm sure that there will be an ample
reward for doing so...
▶Igor
You might also be interested to know
about various factors in fusion.
▶Igor
For example, even when creating the
same Persona...
▶Igor
The combination of spell cards, the
affinities of the demons used...
▶Igor
The position of Terra and Luna, and any
essences added into the mix...
▶Igor
All of these factor into the resultant
Persona. And one more thing...
▶Igor
You may also add an item into the
fusion to trigger a change.
▶Igor
There are some items for which the
result is easily predictable...
▶Igor
But sometimes, even I will be unable
to guess at what may happen.
▶Igor
Should that come about, I do hope that
you'll pardon me.
▶Igor
But make no mistake, I do believe it
is worth trying...
▶Igor
I suggest gems for obtaining a higher-
or lower-ranked fusion within an order.
▶Igor
As for the other items' effects, you
should experiment for yourself.▶Trish
Hi! I'm Trish and this is my fountain
of healing!
▶Trish
This world runs on give-and-take! Give
me money and I'll take away your pain!
▶Trish
What do you say?ԙ
 ▶Trish
Okay!
  ▶Trish
Umm, with the going rate for healing...
And all of you put together...
 ▶Trish
It'll be 3,000 yen.
That's okay, right? 
  ▶Trish
Great! Then here goes!
Pain, pain, go away!
▶Trish
Phew... That should do it!
You're all good to go!
▶Trish
Need anything else? 
▶Trish
You don't have enough!? Boo to that!
There's nothing I hate like poor people!
▶Trish
Come back when your wallet's fuller.
Bye-bye!
▶Trish
Boo to that! You mangy, dirty bum!
Don't blame me if you wind up dead!
 ▶Trish
Well, come again. I'll be waiting!
Bye-bye!
▶Trish
You called me out for no reason!?
Boo to that! Get outta here!▶Maki
Are you finished here? Can we leave yet?
▶Nanjo
Psychological wounds are difficult to
treat, since they can't be seen.
▶Nanjo
Oh, I didn't mean anything in particular.
It just crossed my mind.
  ▶Mark
What're we waiting for? Let's get patched
up and go!
▶Elly
I do want to drive out the demons, but...
I think I'll regret it, just a bit.
   ▶Brown
When's the time come when I'm considered
a local hero? No, a national hero!
▶Ayase
I just wanna hurry up and get back to
normal life!
 ▶Reiji
I want to get this all over with as soon
as I can.
▶Reiji
Don't you have someone waiting for you
to come home, too?
   ▶Nurse
It's dangerous outside, so don't go
wandering around too much!▶Doctor
I hope the demons go away soon...
▶Doctor
Then again, that might put us out of
business. Haha!
   ▶Doctor
Now, what can I do for you?ԙ
 ▶Doctor
Alright... For all of you together...
 ▶Doctor
My fee is 1,࿌00 yen. Well? 
  ▶Doctor
Hm. Then let's get you patched up.
▶Doctor
There, that should do it.
▶Doctor
Anything else you need? 
  ▶Doctor
Well, I can't treat patients who can't
pay. Come back when you have the fee.
  ▶Doctor

I recommend you see me immediately.

It just crossed my mind.
  ▶Mark
What're we waiting for? Let's get patched
up and go!
▶Elly
I want to drive out the demons and return
this town to normal...
▶Brown
When's the time come when I'm considered
a local hero? No, a national hero!
▶Ayase
I just wanna hurry up and get back to
normal life!
 ▶Reiji
I want to get this all over with as soon
as I can.
▶Reiji
Don't you have someone waiting for you
to come home, too?
   ▶Doctor
This used to be a wonderful little town,
but now it's been devastated.
▶Doctor
But enough about that...
How are you feeling?
 ▶Nurse
This town's going entirely to pieces.
I'm not holding out much hope.
▶Nurse
I even find myself sometimes wishing
it would all disappear.▶Maki
Huh? Aren't we going to the shrine,
<FirstName>?
  ▶Maki
I think I know that monster in the subway
from some book... by Lovecraft, I think.
  ▶Maki
The Expel Mirror is here, right?
▶Nanjo
You don't trust Tsutomu? He seems much
more reliable than the one we know.
 ▶Nanjo
Dear lord, that stench...!
 ▶Nanjo
That's right. The Expel Mirror was on
display here.
▶Mark
I feel like we're on a field trip!
Is anything about this place different?
  ▶Mark
What did that monster say? "Yog Sothuh"?
What was that about?
   ▶Mark
That suspicious dude again...
   ▶Elly
I wish they had more exhibits about
demons here.
▶Elly
That demon we saw was marvelous! I was
so moved to lay eyes on it...
▶Elly
We can fight the demon in the subway if
we have the Expel Mirror, correct?
  ▶Brown
This stuff isn't really my thing.
  ▶Brown
We're gonna fight that demon?
Seriously...?
▶Brown
Once we have the Expel Mirror, we can...
fight that demon... yay.
  ▶Ayase
Oh? You might not look like it, but
you're pretty studious, <FirstName>!
 ▶Ayase
Uuuugh, I can't get that monster's smell
off me.
   ▶Ayase
Someday I'll find out who that weird guy
really is!
▶Reiji
You're taking this all a lot better than
I thought, <FirstName>.
 ▶Reiji
I've never seen a monster like that.
   ▶Reiji
Looks like there's only one thing to do.
Let's find this Expel Mirror.▶Agastya Tree
