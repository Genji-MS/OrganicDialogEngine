彻 Ԃ츛ઢ츛Ѕ츛ᶍ츛  蛳 Ἓ̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺Athletic types like me are suckers for
passionate logic... Eh, I'll think
about it.
I don't mind helping, but my goal is to
make it to finals...
 I ain't stupid enough to fall for some
weak-ass rhetoric!
  Shut up, man! The only thing on my mind
is making it to the pros!
Hahaha! You need me on your team?
You'd make a good scout!
 Can a nerd like you tap into the raw
power of a true baller?
 Hey, push your luck and you'll get a
technical foul!
   Think you're better than me or
somethin'? Ha! Don't waste your time.
 Basketball is a gentleman's sport!
Don't be hatin'!
Hmmm? What's that? You want me to kill
you first?
Heheh, sure thing!
Don't say such scary things... I'm sorry
about that last foul, so c'mon...
 C'mon, can't ya look the other way? I'm
gonna be on the dream team some day...
   Jocks like me always fall for the
passionate invitations...
Well, I'll think about it.
I don't mind helping, but my goal is to
make it to finals...
 I can see straight through you! I ain't
dumb enough to fall for that!
  Shut up, man! The only thing on my mind
is making it to the pros!
Where you tryin' to take me? I'm not
goin' anywhere that don't got a ball...
   Oh yeah! I almost forgot about practice!
Sorry, gotta go!
Your song is all... uh... talk!
That don't hit home at all!
Damn, you showin' off in front of me?
Yeah, so what if I can't sing!?
What are you thinkin'? How can you break
into song in front of a demon?
Those sound waves are whack! Make them
stop! P-Please!
   That song ain't half bad! It'd make a
perfect theme song for me!
   Bravo! Bravooo!
  I'm a sucker for the pleas of a lady...
I'll think about it.
   I don't mind helping, but my goal is to
make it to finals...
 You think I'm weak enough to be
persuaded by some girl's sweet talk!?
  Shut up, man! The only thing on my mind
is making it to the pros!
Hahaha! It ain't easy bein' the man!
   You think a girl like you can tap into
the raw power of a true demon baller?
 I'm tryin' to practice here! Go get in
some other dude's way, will ya!?
Hey lady! You're not a spy from the
enemy team, are ya!?
 I'm not a very well-known demon, so why
are you so full of compliments?
Creeps me out...
  You plan on beating my mad ballin'
skills with that kind of attitude?
I'll be the number 23 of the demon
world pretty soon! Wish me luck!
Well, yeah! I can dunk on anyone!
You bookworms say such far-out things.
Seriously!
  Hey, I ain't gonna condone lying, but
imagination is important in sports!
Hey woman, are you tryin' to pull a
fast one on me!?
   You better not be playin' me, girlie...
If you are, you're in for it!
The rule is, liars get their tongues
pulled out!
  I don't know what the hell you're
sayin', but you must mean I'm a genius!
  Huh!? I've never heard that before!
You should cut back on the TV.
  Don't be scared! I'm a nice guy to the
ladies!
 Hey, c'mon, I'm a baller! I would never
try to beat you down! ...Right?
  You're in the way of my practice!
Stop your squawkin'!
 You're not pretending to be scared, are
ya? You must be a rival team's spy!
  Hahaha! Am I really that incredible?
Man, I'm a total sensation!
   Hahaha! You might be so impressed,
you'd keel over and die!
  Hahaha! You got guts, hittin' on me!
   Wait, what? I mean, really, what the hell?
I'm gettin' nervous here.
  I don't need men! I want a cute team
manager, right now!
   Shut up! Say another word, and I'll
crush you!
   Hey, that's a foul. Even if you're
joking, this--Uh oh, you're serious, huh?
   I-I'm a guy... Want me to prove it?
  You? My fan? Hahaha! It ain't easy
bein' a genius on the court!
Sure thing!
  Hahaha! That gag's barely a legal play!
You're a funny guy!
Oh, I'm not that into comedy. So, how's life?
Are ya eatin' right?
   That's a foul. That was so bad, even
the ref's against you now!
Your jokes are lame!
 Ugh... That was horrible...
You're gonna attack me while I'm
laughing, eh? That's cheap!
 Hahaha! Your face is a thousand times
funnier than that!
   I'm not a gloomy guy, y'know? I always
wanted an upbeat buddy like you!
  I may look easygoing, but I've seen
my share of tough times...
 So, all you humans think about is death?
 Shut up! I'm trying to practice here!
Go talk somewhere else!
  If you got time to talk, you got time
to practice! No practice, no victory!
  It's kinda nice to talk about somethin'
other than basketball!
 I never imagined I'd be talking to
someone who didn't know basketball!
   You a performer or somethin'? You're
pretty interesting!
   What... was that?
What!? Hey, cut the crap!
  You got a few screws loose or
somethin'!?
...Don't scare me like that...
 What the? You got somethin' against
me? I'm just a plain ol' b-ball guy...
   I don't get it... Is that gonna help
my game? Well, it IS interesting...
   Ooooh yeah! You're giving that to me
for free, right?
Are you stupid!? Don't you have anything
useful, like shoes or a ball?
 A hoop master like me doesn't need that!
Don't you have anything practical?
  Haha! It's tough bein' a baller! Well,
your intentions sound good enough to me!
You're pretty interesting! I'll make you
my manager!
 Jock demons are suckers for a passionate
speech... Man, I feel pumped!
 You don't sound much like a high school
kid... Are you lyin' 'bout your age?
 I ain't dumb enough to fall for a cold
speech like that!
   Shut up, man! The only thing on my mind
is making it to the pros!
Hahaha! You some kinda honor student!?
Well, whatever!
 Can a nerd like you tap into the raw
power of a true baller?
 Hey, push your luck and you'll get a
technical foul!
   Think you're better than me or
somethin'? Ha! Don't waste your time.
 Basketball is a gentleman's sport!
Don't be hatin'!
You the fool tryin' to step to a baller
with crazy dunk action?
  Don't say such scary things... I'm sorry
about that last foul, so c'mon...
 Why you yellin', man? I'm just a player
practicin' his game...
   You got that right!
I've got mad handles, and I'll drain
shots from anywhere on the floor!
Cut it out, it's embarrassing! You one
of my fans too?
   Shut up! The only cheerleaders I need
are cute chicks!
 Somethin' about the way you put that...
You makin' fun of me?
Hahaha! Flattery won't get you anywhere!
   You're smart aren't ya? You must be a
genius deluxe or somethin'!
Hmm, you're good! I bet you could bring
those skills to the court!
 You're pretty good. Maybe I should learn
to dance too...
 You gotta have a faster beat than that!
Three second violation!
What was that? Looked like you were
startin' a lawnmower or somethin'!
   Ya know, there's kind of a connection
between b-ball and dance.
I can dance too! I've got the Friday
night fever!
Hey, push your luck and you'll get a
technical foul!
   Think you're better than me or
somethin'? Ha! Don't waste your time.
 Basketball is a gentleman's sport!
Don't be hatin'!
You the fool tryin' to step to a baller
with crazy dunk action?
  Don't say such scary things... I'm sorry
about that last foul, so c'mon...
 Why you yellin', man? I'm just a player
practicin' his game...
   You like basketball too? I getcha,
brother.
It's the greatest sport in the world!
Recognize!
  Tch! You're gonna need years of practice
before you can swipe the rock from me,
fool!
Hey! Whatcha lookin' at!? This ball
is mine!
   What...? You got a problem with me!?
 Whoa man! Hahaha! Such a passionate
gaze!
  I'm happy and all, but I don't deal
with guys! Catch my drift!?
  You bookworms say such far-out things.
Seriously!
  Hey, I ain't gonna condone lying, but
imagination is important in sports!
Hey, punk! You tryin' to pull a fast
one on me!?
   You better not be playin' me...
If you are, you're in for it!
The rule is, law, liars get their tongues
pulled out!
 I don't know what the hell you're
sayin', but you must mean I'm a genius!
  Huh!? I've never heard that before!
You should cut back on the TV.
  That's not scary at all! Argh!
I coulda been practicin' that whole time!
  I could tell a scarier story than that!
The heroine killed by a demon will be
played by you!
 That's really depressing... I shoulda
tuned you out...
 H-Hey, that wasn't a true story...
Right?
It's a little childish, but I like
stories with blood and guts!
That was good! Do humans fear me like
that too?
  Hm, you've got a nice voice! With you
cheering me on, the next game's as
good as won!
  You're good! How 'bout we do a duet?
You'd be okay with that, right?
 Your song is all... uh... talk!
That don't hit home at all!
Damn, you showin' off in front of me?
Yeah, so what if I can't sing!?
That song ain't half bad! It'd make a
perfect theme song for me!
   Bravo! Bravooo!
  Ain't you a little old to be playin'
house, man? Not that I care...
Hey, hey... Do I look like a kid to you?
 What the hell!? I'm not playin' house
ever again!
  I know... It's like I've got the ball
on a string, isn't it?
 Hahaha! Your negotation style doesn't
jive with me. Well, it's been fun.
   Do I look like a baby? You're losin' it!
 I'm a sucker for the pleas of a lady...
I'll think about it.
   I don't mind helping, but my goal is to
make it to finals...
 You think I'm weak enough to be
persuaded by some girl's sweet talk!?
  Shut up, man! The only thing on my mind
is making it to the pros!
Hahaha! It ain't easy bein' the man!
   You want me to work for you? Hahaha!
What a comedian!
Hey, push your luck and you'll get a
technical foul!
   Think you're better than me or
somethin'? Ha! I won't lose to a chick!
   What's up with that? You ain't even my
type, ya good for nothin'!
  You the dumb girl tryin' to step to my
ballin' skills?
   What the heck are you? Talkin' like that
to a god among ballers...
 Why...? Why would I need you to tell
me that?
I always fall for the seductive types...
I'll give it some thought.
My pheromones must be goin' nuts! It's
tough sometimes, ya know?
   Listen! I'm gonna be a basketball god
soon! You're nothin' to me!
  Shut up, man! The only thing on my mind
is making it to the pros!
Hahaha! It ain't easy bein' the man!
   Hey baby! I'll embrace you with open
arms! Come to daddy!
You're goin' through a lot, huh? I've
seen hard times too, so I understand.
Hey, hey, don't cry now... I'll give
you tickets to my next game if that'll
cheer you up.
So what!? Compared to my training
regimen, that's nothin'!
 You stupid or somethin'!? No way I'd
fall for some brat's crocodile tears!
   High school girls' households are
pretty crazy these days, huh...?
 I can't believe you grew up in a
household like that... I'm speechless.
  That was weak. I was hoping for crazier
threats than that.
 Think you're better than me or
somethin'? Ha! I won't lose to a chick!
   What's up with that? You ain't even my
type, ya good for nothin'!
  You the dumb girl makin' threats to a
demon baller like me?
  I just like shootin' hoops... I don't
know why you'd be after me...
Why...? Why would I need you to tell
me that?
Did you think I'd be happy bein' picked
on by you!? If you did, you're an idiot!
   You didn't think I'd be afraid of that,
did ya!? Huh!?
   What the heck are you? Talkin' like that
to a god among ballers...
 Why...? Why would I need you to tell
me that?
Hahaha! You may be interested, but
I sure as hell ain't!
   Hahaha! I bet you were a bully when
you were a kid, huh?
 Hmm, you're a good speaker.
If you were the coach, the team would
be pumped for the game!
 You don't sound much like a high school
kid... Are you lyin' 'bout your age?
 Hey, hey, hey! Whaddaya sayin!? Don't
be tryin' to talk all big!
   You preachin' to me!? Think you're
better than me, do ya!?
   It's hilarious when someone with no
skills tries to talk like a bigshot!
   Hahaha! You're ten years too young
to tell me off!
   What the hell!? What'd I do to deserve
you goin' off on me like that!?
 What're you bein' so high and mighty
about!? I'm older than you, ya know!
What the...? I'm just tryin' to play
a little ball here...
 Why you gotta scold me just 'cause
I was shootin' some hoops...?
 Hahaha! That was so off the mark,
all I can do is laugh!
   Hahaha! You're good at scolding. You
should be our team manager.
 You're only ignoring me 'cause you ain't
seen my game. Otherwise, you'd be
beggin' for my autograph!
   Just 'cause you're embarrassed doesn't
mean you should ignore me! C'mon, let's
be friends!
   Tch, what a snob! You don't even wanna
negotiate with me, do ya!?
  Quit ignoring me! You want me to dunk
on your face!?
 Umm... Did I do something to make
ya mad...?
   Why you ignorin' me? You don't like
baller demons?
   You're only ignoring me 'cause you ain't
seen my game. Otherwise, you'd be
beggin' for my autograph!
   Just 'cause you're embarrassed doesn't
mean you should ignore me! C'mon, let's
be friends!
   Tch, what a snob! You don't even wanna
negotiate with me, do ya!?
  Quit ignoring me! You want me to dunk
on your face!?
 Umm... Did I do something to make
ya mad...?
   Umm... Did I do something to make
ya mad...?
 That was weak. I was hoping for crazier
threats than that.
 Think you're better than me or
somethin'? Ha! Don't waste your time.
 Oh yeah!?
  You the fool tryin' to step to a baller
with crazy dunk action?
  I just like shootin' hoops... I don't
know why you'd be after me...
Why...? Why would I need you to tell
me that?
Stop yelling! You'll get a personal foul!
  You got a screw loose or somethin'!?
 This guy's dangerous...
Whatcha screamin' for...?
Hahaha! It's refreshing to yell
sometimes, isn't it!?
  Nice scream! That's how I like 'em!
  You can do magic!? You've got skills...
Maybe you could play point guard!
  If that's the best trick you've got,
I'd say you'd make a better comedian!
   A magic trick? In this day and age?
Get real, man...
   Can you use magic to change the score?
   THAT was your trick? Hahaha! That was
hilarious!
   Hahaha! You shouldn't do stuff that
doesn't go with your face!
   Hahaha! I think I'm gettin' smarter just
watchin' you!
 Talk, wait for a reaction, gain some
interest... Your negotations are
straight outta the playbook.
 Whatwhatwhat!? You want somethin' from
me!? How about an advance on the
contract then!?
   It was a stupid conversation, but
I listened anyway.
I don't think I'll let you have any
last words after all!
You are horrifically annoying! Your
voice makes me wanna puke my guts out!
 Stop your yappin' and come out with it!
   What is telling me that supposed to do
for you?
Oh, sorry, I spaced out for a second
there...
  You doin' a talk show or somethin'?
"Our next guest is a <Name>, let's
bring him out!" Like that?
   Hahaha! You're a smooth talker, you
devil, you!
Personally, I like your speech! Just a
little more, okay!?
You've got good eyes! I AM incredible,
after all! Not sure how, though...
  You're a blunt one, aren't ya? I like
it! Keeps things simple!
 Whatwhatwhat!? You want me to help you!?
Then hand something over!
To put it simply... NO!
Now keep things simple and give me
somethin'!
This is boring... Give our negotiation
a nice twist!
   Who'd actually want to do you a favor!?
You sound like you're up to somethin'...
I'm gonna play some d...
  Even if I give you my power, I'm not
getting much in return, huh...?
   Oh, sorry, I spaced out for a second
there...
  Hahaha! I'm just too appealing!
I'm happy to be idolized, but it's
tough sometimes, man. It really is!
 I think I'm fine with lending you my
power! Just a little more then!
  You always have that attitude when you
negotiate? I don't get you. ...I don't
get myself, either, though.
  Huh? What the? Am I supposed to be
happy or sad?
   I don't care if you're dissin' me... But
you coulda just said, "Shut up and gimme
somethin'!"
So... I'll say it instead! Shut up and
gimme somethin'!
Huh!? You wanna die!? Do ya!?
  Of all the people I've met, I hate you
the most!
   Tch, what's with that attitude?
You wanna die!?
Not that you'd be any match for me...
So here are my demands!
   Why you... Can't you tell the difference
between good and bad?
 Such attitude... I-I'm not cryin'...
Just sweatin' from my eyes...
 I can't get all worked up by somethin'
some kid says...
Damn, what an attitude problem! Well,
I'll take fearless over cowardly any day.
You won't get me with taunts!
After all, I'm a genius! Hahaha!
My horoscope said, "Avoid losing your
temper," so I'll forgive you!
So you wanna be an entertainer, eh?
You sure you wanna be here, then?
  No, no, you're thinking too much! You
gotta use your instincts.
Comedy is somethin' you're supposed to
charge for, ya know...
 Show me somethin' more interesting!
That... was... ... ... boring!
 You wasted my time with your stupidity!
I won't forgive you very easily, so
gimme somethin' to make up for it!
   Who do you think I am...? You better
start gettin' serious here!
   W-Was I so scary that you lost it?
 I'm jealous... You don't get nervous,
do you?
  Maybe I should learn a trick or two.
   Hahaha! You're funny! Man, I feel like
havin' a drink now...
   That kinda stuff doesn't interest me...
But I feel sorry for you, so I'll hear
you out!
   There's no guarantee this isn't a
trap... Hmmm...
  I can't sign with you for just that!
How 'bout throwin' in an extra one?
  Don't tease your elders like that!
 Ha! Like I'd quit ballin' for somethin'
that stupid! Are you an idiot!?
Gimme the goods, and I'll give ya a
spell card. That's reality for ya.
I'm so cute, you thought I was a girl?
Wow, that's crazy.
  Sorry, I'm just not in the mood. Maybe
next time...
W-Wait, wait! I'm still not ready yet...
   Hahaha! Everyone's hooked on me!
Hahahahaha!
   This kinda puts me on the spot...
But... I don't wanna turn down your
goodwill, so I'll take whatever it is
you're offerin'.
 You're more interesting than demons...
Maybe I should go with you guys...
  First you threaten me, then you soothe
my nerves. You work in mysterious ways.
 I'm not blind, ya know. But that was
cute, so it's all good!
   Heh, you're scared of me? Then bow down
before me! Cry and beg for mercy!
  You're 100 years too young to get my
attention with a tactic like that!
Being forgiven through words alone
is a bit idealistic, don't ya think?
   I don't have a freakin' clue what's
going on in that head of yours...
  I-I get it already... You're mad, huh?
C'mon, man, don't speak with that blank
stare on your face...
   Don't worry, I don't do anything bad
to ladies. I'm a feminist.
I'm a bigger demon than I thought!
 You look pretty tender, but you should
put on a little more meat.
  What!? You already have my spell card!
You don't need two!
 If you want. Alright! Here ya go!
  Tch, is that so!?
  Seems you and me don't get along.
Well, guess that can't be helped.
Huh? You!? YOU want my spell card!?
I don't think I heard you right!
You're way too weak!
 Oh well. Go ahead, take it.
Lates.
 I'll give this to you, too. Nice
meetin' ya!
   *sigh* Stick around here too long, and
I'll have roots growin' outta my ass.
I'm outta here.
   Here's my card. I don't care who you
fuse me with, just not with any crap,
okay!?
Make me a Persona that can bring his
A game to the hoop!
...Oh yeah! I'll give you this! You're
happy now, right? Right!? So, please!
Just lemme go!
Man, if I hang around you any longer,
my head's gonna get moldy!
   I'll give ya this, so scram! Hahaha!
   Now then, what should I do with you...?
I have no idea! Is my brain that weak!?
Argh! I don't get it! You want a card,
right!? Fine, take it!
  I'm not too good with words, but I wanna
help you guys out.
If it's okay with you, take my card!
I don't think it's a bad offer...
 Damn it! I don't wanna fight you!
  I must be goin' soft... But here's a
present! Take it!
 I know! You want my card, right?
   But if you kill me after I give you my
card, there's no point...Yeahhh, huh...
 Heh heh! Well, if it isn't a human!
Hmm... Why are you guys runnin'
around here?
Tryin' to negotiate with a demon? Man,
talk about crazy...
 It must be fate that we've met here!
Gimme somethin' to remember you by!
  Hey, you! You're in my way!
  What the hell!? Don't talk to me!
I was just out havin' a stroll!
  Look, if you wanna pass, gimme
somethin'! Those're the rules!
 You might get hurt if something happens
while you're near me...
  Ugh, you guys... I knew it was bad luck
when that black cat walked in front of
me this morning...
  There's no way demons could lose to
humans! Um, that's what the others
think, anyway.
  Hey, what's happening? There a game
goin' on?
You answered! Is it because I'm just
so popular?
   Y'know, I don't talk to humans too
often. I'm actually kinda nervous...
Well, I'm glad you answered my call,
but I have a question...
If you've got time to be doin' this,
don't you have somethin' better you
could be doin'?
 You got some business with me!? Or are
you just here to chill? Gimme a straight
answer!
   Gimme somethin', and maybe I'll be
willing to listen!
You don't really want anything from me,
huh? Guess I'll be off...
   Aw crap, humans! Man, I have the worst
luck...
I always get the troublemakers. Same
with my love life.
   First off, let's set some ground rules.
NO VIOLENCE! I'll treat ya right...
   To tell you the truth, my heart is
pounding. Man, I just wanna go nuts!
 Y'know, I think we're close enough to
call each other brothers!
   I love humans... But I shouldn't be
going on like that, huh?
  You some kinda spy? You can't fool
me, spy!
 It wasn't me! It wasn't me, man!
Have a heart!
Ugh... ᄀ... I'm your... grandpa...
Thank you for calling me here...
...Violence is not the way... You must
not harm demons... Guwah!? Did I just
say somethin'!?
 Do you really think you can change
things on your own!?
 Just as ants cannot comprehend the size
of an elephant, you cannot comprehend
my greatness!
   I'll be king of the world someday!
It's best if you don't mess with me!
  What play are you guys gonna use on me?
Is it the pick and roll!? Anything but
the pick and roll!
   What is this? I've never felt my heart
pound so fast...
   Hurt me morrrrrrre!
   Sooo... Whatcha tryin' to say?
 You've pissed me off, and that's
a foul punishable by death! Time
to pay up!
   Wha-What...? You don't like me, huh?
   I don't feel like we're strangers
anymore. Can I call ya "bro"?
How long you plannin' on dragging this
out? If ya got business with me, come
out with it!
  I'm willin' to hear ya out, so put
away those shiny weapons, will ya?
  Ah, the smell of blood is in the air.
I'm feelin' good today, so I'll hear
ya out!
 I can't take it anymore! Someone, help
me! These guys are whack!
   I can smell blood! It looks fun over
there!
If I cut my stomach open, would you eat
it? I'd eat you, ya know...
It's all about the Yenjamins, baby!
I gotta buy a new ball! Gimme <Amount>!
   Sorry 'bout that, man!
 Don't mess with me, punk! You ain't
pullin' no fast ones on me!
Don't mess with me, punk! That's pretty
funny to say ya've got somethin' when
ya don't!
Look, I ain't askin' ya to give me
somethin'. I'm ordering you!
You ain't the sharpest tool in the shed,
are ya? There's no point in saving up
money. Once ya die, it's useless.
   One life stone! I'll settle for that!
  You've got more than I thought! But
I've gotta say, this doesn't feel like
it's enough.
Hey, hey, hey, hey! Gimme a break!
This is going nowhere!
  Hey! Don't be lyin' to me!
 My hearing must be going! I didn't just
hear you say "no," did I!?
 Huh? If ya want my wrath, I'll give it
to ya free of charge!
   ......
...Naw, you don't have to give me one if
ya don't want to!
 Hey, check this out! Isn't this a
pretty gem?
  Tch! It's pointless talking to you!
If ya desire too much, it'll destroy you!
  ...Well, I did say you didn't have to
give it to me...
 If you give me some of your life,
I'm sure I'd feel a little better!
   There, there, you're a good kid.
I'll make sure it doesn't hurt!
   Tch! You're a bad kid, so I'm gonna
punish you! That's right, ya brat!
 Denied!? But I really want some!
I've got a craving for blood!
 What!? I... I! I'm chasing the dream!
  Well said! Positive thinking is
important!
 Well, there you have it.
   You're an honest one, huh? It might be
fun to watch honesty turn around and
bite ya...
 You'll see whether or not that's
possible when ya eat my dunk!
 You've got confidence... Something's
up... Something's up with you!
Oh well. Guess I'll do some babysitting!
   Oh well! This is why I hate kids!
  Is that so? Then let's try it out!
 Heh, what a bull! You see what you want,
and you charge! I like that!
  Well, yeah! If you get it, can't you
have a little more humility!?
 Oh, that so? Then... Maybe I should have
you shine my ball!
Oooh, that makes me happy. Youngsters
should act more like that!
   Oooh, that makes me happy! And it makes
it even easier to kill you!
It's rough, man. Practice is a battle
where your opponent is yourself.
 Whaddaya mean!? This is important to me!
You don't get it!
 What!? I... I! I'm chasing the dream!
  Well said! Positive thinking is
important!
 Well, there you have it.
   You're an honest one, huh? It might be
fun to watch honesty turn around and
bite ya...
 You'll see whether or not that's
possible when ya eat my dunk!
 Oh er... Um... I'm short on time here,
and this guy ain't even listening...
You idiot! You can't win without practice!
Don't you get it!?
  I don't need your sympathy! So what if
my only skill is ballin'!?
  Huh!? Well, aren't we frank!
I'll crush your throat!
   I'm goin' to nationals! Not like
I wanna be a singer...
What are you doing to me!? I've got a
game comin' up! You're dead, man!
I'm losing consciousness... It's kinda
different from runnin' outta breath...
  Encore! Encore! Sing another one!
  If I made you my slave, I could hear
that song anytime...! I'm a genius!
But I'm a nice guy, so I'll take
somethin' else instead.
Hold on, man... If I keep listening,
I'll be like a charmed snake...
   What!? I... I! I'm chasing the dream!
  Huh!? Really!? Wow, I'm all fired up!
  Well, there you have it.
   You're an honest one, huh? It might be
fun to watch honesty turn around and
bite ya...
 You'll see whether or not that's
possible when ya eat my dunk!
 You've got confidence... Something's
up... Something's up with you!
Oh well. Guess I'll do some babysitting!
   Oh well! This is why I hate kids!
  Huh? That's not it? Sorry, I get all
hyped up before a game. But my fans
are welcome anytime!
  Hehehe... So you're okay with anything
I do to you, right!? Hehehehe...
Man, no fair! I hate things like this!
 Ya wanna get knocked out? I still got
five fouls to spare!
 Ah, so I'm a genius after all, eh?
Then gimme somethin'!
  Huh? That so? Heck, maybe I'm not that
bad eh!?
Don't be frontin' like you actually
know! You've never seen me dunk!
   Yeah, even humans don't bother dealing
with weaklings!
 Hey, hey, hey! You don't know b-ball, do
you? Come watch me play some time!
You still frontin' with lies!?
That's not good, man!
   An honest heart is the key to gettin'
better! Take my advice, and you'll have
it made in the shade!
I get it, I get it. You can continue
this conversation in hell.
You're an honest one, huh? It might be
fun to watch honesty turn around and
bite ya...
 Then stick out your tongue! I'll yank
it out gently!
   Argh! You need a sports buddy. Y'know,
someone like me!
Hahaha! I've seen a lotta guys like
that! But I'll keep my mouth shut.
 I'm super pissed! I'm exploding with
the urge to kill you!
 Heh! You're on! I'll crush you!
Y'know, with girls... It makes me feel
kinda guilty, so I don't really like
to...
  Don't worry about it. Just gimme
somethin' and it'll be all good.
 Huh? That's not it? Sorry, I get all
hyped up before a game. But my fans
are welcome anytime!
  Hehehe... So you're okay with anything
I do to you, right!? Hehehehe...
Man, no fair! I hate things like this!
 What!? You don't think the ferocious demon
side is all there is to me, do you!?
Yeah, even humans don't bother dealing
with weaklings!
 You're right. It'd be a problem if
someone died every time I made a shot...
Hey, I learned something new today!
   It's not okay! What're you thinking!?
I'm really gonna crush you!
  I-Is it really okay to crush you...?
No... Maybe I don't want to...
Whaddaya mean, "What?" I mean, I'm not
gonna just say whatever! It's not like
I'm doing... Oh, whatever...
 Hey, stop! It was a lie! A technical
foul! Don't come near meee!
   What the hell!? Don't scare me like
that! It pisses me off!
Don't startle me like that... It really
scared me.
 No, thank you for being born for the
sole purpose of meeting me!
   What the heck!? Say what you mean!
Man, just forget it!
If you put your mind to it, you'll be
ready for anything! So... ready to
experience another world?
 Hey, you're eating better than I am!
I'll pull it outta yer stomach!
   Huh? Don't cry ,man. Geez. Alright,
already, I'll finish you off.
 In comedy, ya can't tell a crappy joke
and then expect an apology to cover it!
 Hmm... Seems you've got some pride.
I can dig that.
Don't even think about pullin' the wool
over my eyes! I-I... I... I won't be
fooled...
 ...Which means, oh crap!
   S-See!? I know everything, man!
We're buddies, right? We should go steal
somethin' together!
But before we do that, buddies steal
from each other all the time!
  We're buddies already! When I get to the
pros, you better root for me!
 Tch! Who'd want a punk like you, anyway?
   If you're gonna do that, you may as well
be my dinner! You're wastin' food!
You happy-go-lucky punks don't need to
bother!
 Hahaha! I must sound pretty full of
myself, huh? Well, I AM incredible!
Hahaha! I must sound pretty full of
myself, huh? Well, I AM incredible!
Well... Y'know, overcoming one's self
is pretty deep!
  You must be thrilled to converse with
an all-star baller, huh!? Hahaha!
*sigh* I'm opening up my heart to you
here, gimme a break...
   *sigh* I'm opening up my heart to you
here... That's no way to treat me!
   If that was a joke, I'm supposed to be
laughing, right? Haaaaaahaha! Hm...
More? HAHAHAHA!
 Oh, a gag of some sort? Huh...
Is that so...?
  Whaddaya mean "nothing"!? I'm gonna pick
a fight this time!
What a stupid attitude! I won't forgive
ya for tryin' to scare me like that! Geez!
 Gyahahaha! You really are crazy!
   You're crazy...so I'll be crazy too!
Bleyeahhagghha! Psssfhht! UGA UGAHH!
  What...? Why're you laughing!? Argh!
C'mon, tell me, tell meeee!
   You wanna throw down? Let's get it on!
Kill me if you can! Er... Wait...
Maybe that's not such a good idea...?
 I get it now! You're the reason the
team's in shambles! Disagreeable guys
like you are useless!
Oooh, you're a stand-up guy! That makes
me happy.
  So, hand it over! Now! Just give it to
me, dammit!
 What!? You tryin' to pawn this off on
me!? You shouldn't be doin' business
with demons!
Hey, you've got it! My shoes wear out
fast, so this'll help me out.
So you were holding back!? That pisses
me off! Don't you dare look down on me!
 Well, then I'm not interested.
 First off, bring me a soul. We'll split
it 70-30!
Ha! Not like you humans could do that!
You wouldn't last a day in my entourage!
 You're a dude... Not that I'm
discriminatin', but I'll pass...
 Hahaha! C'mon man, quit clownin' me!
Be honest for once!
   You got guts to ignore my question!
When'd you become such a big shot, huh?
Is that so? So you failed a year!?
Hahaha, sorry to hear that!
 Well, there ya have it.
You'll see whether or not that's
possible when ya eat my dunk!
 You'll see whether or not that's
possible when ya eat my dunk!
 You've got confidence... Something's
up... Something's up with you!
Oh well. Guess I'll do some baby-sitting!
  Oh well! This is why I hate kids!
  Is that so? Then let's try it out!
 Heh, what a bull! You see what you want,
and you charge! I like that!
  Well, yeah! If you get it, can't you
have a little more humility!?
 Oh, I get it... You're sayin' you wanna
give me somethin'! Sorry, I was
confused. So let's see here...
Oooh, that makes me happy. Youngsters
should act more like that!
   I'm about to throw a tomahawk jam down
on your dome!
   Ooh, you understand me!? You're not
such a bad guy!
Whaddaya mean, "stupid"!? No pain, no
gain! You just don't get it!
 N-No way... There's actually someone who
doesn't get stunned by my power play?
 Haha... I like your attitude.
It's interesting.
Hahaha! Didn't need to ask, huh!?
  Hahaha! Alright, leave it to me!
   Is that so? That's how you're gonna
roll, eh!? You're ready to do this,
aren't ya!?
I don't got time to deal with fools who
can't understand my appeal!
I like your confidence!
Ha, don't belittle me! I'm a times
tables master!
  Hahaha! Glad ya noticed!
   How nice. I'm surprised you're such a
gentleman with a face like that.
 Then forget it.
Hey, punk! Don't underestimate me! There
ain't nothin' I can't do in this world!
   You callin' me a shrimp!? I'll dunk on
your face!
  Oh! I love the chicken dance! That's how
the party gets started, right!? Hahaha!
   That's... a dance? I can't keep up with
these human fads...
Oooh, they like it! Way to go, me!
You're awesome!
 Oh... No good huh? U-Um... Anyone
wanna do the New York Hustle with me?
No dice? ...Well, whatever. I'm no
dancer anyway.
  Is that so? Then let's try it out!
 Heh, what a bull! You see what you want,
and you charge! I like that!
  Well, yeah! If you get it, can't you
have a little more humility!?
 Oh, I get it... You're sayin' you wanna
give me somethin'! Sorry,I was
confused. So let's see here...
 Oooh, that makes me happy. Youngsters
should act more like that!
   I'm about to throw a tomahawk jam down
on your dome!
   Ooh, you understand me!? You're not
such a bad guy!
Whaddaya mean, "stupid"!? No pain, no
gain! You just don't get it!
 That's a bluff, right? It's no fun if
the trick is obvious...
  N-No way... Gimme back my skills, man...
   Hahaha! It's useless! But keep goin'!
It's funny!
  Whoa! If someone as perfect as me has
any flaws, you better let me know!
   You didn't have to be so... blunt
about it...
  There is something, isn't there!? Are
my free-throws bad? Do I telegraph my
shots!?
If you say so, I guess I'll have to put
my foot down! But I'm kinda scared...
  Huh? That was easy! Tch! Is that all
you're gonna bring to the table!?
 You still frontin' with lies!?
That's not good, man!
   An honest heart is the key to gettin'
better! Take my advice, and you'll have
it made in the shade!
I get it, I get it. You can continue
this conversation in hell.
You're an honest one, huh? It might be
fun to watch honesty turn around and
bite ya...
 Then stick out your tongue! I'll yank
it out gently!
   Argh! You need a sports buddy. Y'know,
someone like me!
Hahaha! I've seen a lotta guys like
that! But I'll keep my mouth shut.
 I'm super pissed! I'm exploding with
the urge to kill you!
 You're a strange chick... But I find
that kinda interesting...
 Why, man...? I might get famous and
sign a movie deal!
 You don't get it! This is your chance
to be a star!
In the credits, you'll be listed as
victim number one!
No way...
  Hahaha! Figures!
   Stay outta the way of my shots! You get
hit, ya die!
   Wh-Why am I being laughed at!?
You lied, lady!
 This can't be... I'm being laughed at
by humans...
 Hahahaha! There's no woman who'd turn
me down!
 You're a cold one, lady! That pisses me
off, gettin' rejected like that!
   I don't need your sympathy! So what if
my only skill is ballin'!?
  Huh!? Well, aren't we frank!
I'll crush your throat!
   I'm goin' to nationals! Not like
I wanna be a singer...
Encore! Encore! Sing another one!
  If I made you my slave, I could hear
that song anytime...! I'm a genius!
But I'm a nice guy, so I'll take
somethin' else instead.
Hold on man... If I keep listening,
I'll be like a charmed snake...
Then I'll do somethin' bad now!
Gimme somethin'!
  What's up with that crazy accent!?
You're weird!
   Hahahaha! Guess the jig's up!
But I ain't a kid, y'know.
   Oh... You wanna fight? Well, I ain't
much for violence, but...
 So you're jealous of the genius, huh?
That's pathetic, man...
  Hahaha! It's no use! This guy's off in
la-la land!
 That's good to know! But... I ain't
gonna forgive ya for treatin' me like a
child, y'hear!?
What!? I... I! I'm chasing the dream!
  Huh? Ya really think so? Alright, I'll
do it!
  Well, there you have it.
   You're an honest one, huh? It might be
fun to watch honesty turn around and
bite ya...
 I guess I'm gonna hafta break you off a
little sumthin' sumthin'!
  I don't mind if you're serious, but you
should know, I'm already married to
the hoop!
  You ain't worthy to speak to the super-
star of the basketball world!
  Oh well! This is why I hate kids!
  You're right... I probably shouldn't...
Haha... I like your attitude.
It's interesting.
Hahaha! You've got a level head on your
shoulders! I like that!
What the heck are you...? Aren't you
afraid of me...?
  Well, I ain't too big on violence,
but...!
 What!? That ticks me off!
  Huh? What that's about a kitchen? Wait!
You're not gonna eat me, are you?
  Oh, is that so!? Then I hate you too!
  Well, there you have it.
   Let's see... Gimme somethin', and I'll
think about it.
Lay off, woman! I ain't gonna let my
dreams get shaken by no perfume!
  Hahaha! That's right! I AM a star, huh?
What the heck!? Weren't we gonna do
somethin' awesome!? You were toyin' with
me, weren't you!?
 No way...You aren't diggin' me?
I didn't know girls like that existed...
   That was a quick reversal! Those were
crocodile tears, then, eh!?
  Oh, I'm just glad I could make ya happy!
   Whoa! Not bad, man! I like ya!
 Huh!? I piss you off!? I'm about to
make you cry for real!
 For real? Hmm... Oh well.
  Which means... That was a lie?
You're one scary chick...
   What's with this chick? She crazy or
somethin'?
I didn't mean it like that... It hurts
knowing how wrong I was...
  You're right... I probably shouldn't...
Heh, what a bull! You see what you want,
and you charge! I like that!
  Hahaha! You've got a level head on your
shoulders! I like that!
What the heck are you...? Aren't you
afraid of me...?
  Oooh, that makes me happy. Youngsters
should act more like that!
   What!? That ticks me off!
  Huh? What that's about a kitchen? Wait!
You're not gonna eat me, are you?
  Oh, is that so!? Then I hate you too!
  Hahaha! You a fool or somethin'?
   Oh... You wanna fight? Well, I ain't
much for violence, but...
 Want me to set that annoying attitude
of yours straight!?
  What's up with that attitude? You tryin'
to make a fool outta a genius?
That's right! It's not okay! Got it?
So don't do that again.
   Do we have really bad chemistry!?
  Hahaha! You've got composure! You'd
make a great shooting guard!
   You can't stop! If you stop in the
middle, damn it, I won't forgive you!
   You're a bully, aren't ya!? I, the hero
of the school, will take you down!
 You got guts to ignore my question!
When'd you become such a big shot, huh?
Sorry 'bout that! But still, you're
pretty mature for a high schooler!
 Whoa... She's a real dominatrix...
 People like you annoy me! I hate it when
fools don't know themselves!
  Don't drag me into this...
 You want me to dunk on your face!?
 Hahaha! You tell it like it is! That's
refreshing in a woman.
  Oh... You wanna fight? Well, I ain't
much for violence, but...
 No difference!? You don't understand age
in demon years, do you!?
  No, it's not okay! I'll serve justice
to fools like you!
   That's right! It's not okay! Got it?
So don't do that again.
   This chick's crazy...
  Hahaha! Don't be so shy!
   You can't stop! If you stop in the
middle, damn it, I won't forgive you!
   Why not...? You'd be able to watch my
godly plays every day...
 Really? Then I'll show you what fear is
all about!
 What a mean girl... But I'm kinda
diggin' that...
  What's up with this guy?
   But it's all about playin' it cool and
kind now... Is it the end of my era?
You can block my dunks!? Incredible!
   You wanna eat my jump shot? You'll
have a flat face!
   Well, you say that, but... I mean, I am
a demon, after all...
  Ugh... *cough*
 You like baseball, then? Well, if Mike
did it, so can I...
 You're demonic! I like that!
   You're demonic! I like that!
   What's with this guy? Didn't you come
to negotiate?
Ignored again. What the hell...?
   Ignored again. What the hell...?
   I'm pissed!
Really!? Then I'll be hated even more!
 Ugh... *cough*
 This dude's scarier than the team
captain...
   I don't wanna die, dumbass!

Heh, what a bull! You see what you want,
and you charge! I like that!
 Oh, well, I'll say it again... Gimme
somethin'!
   That's when I punch you!
   That's when I punch you!
   Oh, well, I'll say it again... Gimme
somethin'!
   Why don't you know? You some kinda
sheep without a will of your own?
   Wanna race? An athlete like me's gonna
be faster than you!
 Quit lyin'!
You're crazy...so I'll be crazy too!
Bleyeahhagghha! Psssfhht! UGA UGAHH!
  You're crazy...so I'll be crazy too!
Bleyeahhagghha! Psssfhht! UGA UGAHH!
  Whaddaya mean, "Ha..."? You're pretty
confident...
 You wanna throw down? Let's get it on!
Kill me if you can! Er... Wait...
Maybe that's not such a good idea...?
 Don't look down on me! I ain't goin' down
without a fight!
 I don't like that trait.
   Tch, that's a lie, loser!
  You can't stand me liking you that much!?
  What the heck!? And here I was startin'
to like you! You're mean, man!
 What the heck!? And here I was startin'
to like you! You're mean, man!
 I won't do anything.
   Sounds fishy, but I'll trust you.
  Sounds fishy, but I'll trust you.
  I won't do anything, but... that's
just creepy, man...
 You're incredible, man! Do it for me
next time!
That's more like it! That's how a man
should be!
   What's up with that smirk!? You mockin'
me!? Huh!?
 That part about bein' a scout is a lie!
You're out to capture demons!
  What genius gave this guy a sharp
object!? He's whack...
   Then why are you all up in arms?
You're weird!
 Whaddaya mean, "Where?" Over there!
Er... Over here? You idiot, how you've
got me lost too!
To think... Someone exists who speaks
to me like this... I'm happy, but kinda
sad too...
   If an apology is all it takes, you
wouldn't need the police! That's what a
human would say, right!?
You don't mind, huh!? Humans are so much
cuter when they're honest!
Yeah, see? It's best not to get in
the way!
Y-You may be tryin' to s-s-scare me...
B-B-But it's u-u-useless...
 Huh? Really? Well, if you say so, maybe
I'll go...
 Hahaha! Well, duh! There's no such
thing! Still, that pisses me off!
   Hahaha! Well, yeah! If there was a game,
there's no way I wouldn't know about it!
  You're just stingy! Don't tell me you
don't have anything now, 'cause I'll
kill you!
   As long as people like you are around,
the demon business is safe! Thanks, man!
Then don't just think about it! Do it!
You youngsters are all talk!
Am I supposed to come pick up empty soda
cans with you? Too bad, I'm a bad guy!
Is that right? Well, if I can be of
service...
 Is that right? Well, if I can be of
service...
 Urgh... Well, if you really think so...
Ooh, that sounds cool! Lemme copy you!
 Ooh, that's cool! Let's destroy the
world, then--Huh? No?
  That was cold... Y-You're mean!
Why you gotta put things all cold-like!?
You don't understand demons at all!
   Huh? You're worried about me? Damn...
I'm feelin' all warm and fuzzy now...
I-I-I knew it! I'm gonna die! Or get
locked away for good!
 Was that supposed to be funny? C'mon...
you gotta laugh, or you'll die...
  That was hilarious! But I ain't lettin'
down my guard, either!
 Ha, brings back memories... I used to
be like that... Maybe I should try again!
So it's something you need to do, even
though you don't want to? I see...
  You don't know? I won't be used by a
loser like this!
  Arrrrgh! What're you doing!? You're not
human! Ahhh, s-stop!
   Y-You serious!? No kiddin' around!
You sure it's okay!?
I'm happy, but, kinda sad at the same
time... This is complex...
