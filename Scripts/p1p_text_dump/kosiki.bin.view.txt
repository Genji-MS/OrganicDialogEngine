彻 Ԃ츛ઢ츛ങ츛ച츛  蛳 Ω̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺What thou sayest is rational...
I see, thou may appear young, but thou
hast endured many trials. Thy words
bear weight.
  Speak not such nonsense!
   Thou speakest of such uncanny things...
Is this thine intention?
 What reason hast thou to speak on such
subjects? Art thou interested in me...?
 What meanest thou? Dost thou desire my
power?
Thou hast confidence. A battle with thee
would be most enjoyable.
  Thou art confident in thy strength...
What wouldst thou do with me?
  Shall I be thine opponent?
 Thy tongue weaveth a grand tapestry, but
it shalt fall mute if thou hast not the
fortitude to back thy words...
  Thou art an extortionist, knave? I have
no coin for thee.
  Hm? That scowl...
What thou sayest is rational...
Thou dost display sound reason to seek
courtship with me. Thou art truly one
who knoweth the world.
  Speak not such nonsense!
   Thou art confident in thy strength...
What wouldst thou do with me?
  I am unamused by such stories...
   Wh-What...? Thou conspirest to seize me
with words made to seem sweet, when in
truth, they drip with malice...
   A fine voice indeed... But let us change
the tune... I would have thy screams!
 Dost thou mean to challenge the bearer
of the netherworld's sweetest voice?
Consider the gauntlet thrown!
Hark... That may... have bested me...
  How dost thou maintain thy calm
disposition with such vile sounds
assaulting thee?
   Haha... Thou canst match me not, but
it doth suffice.
  Hmmm...
  What thou sayest is rational... As
such, I shall proffer a request.
   Thou dost display sound reason to seek
courtship with me. Thou art truly one
who knoweth the world.

power?
I despise such adulation!
  Thinkest thou that I am blind to thine
intentions!?
  Thou art eerie.
I compare not to thee...
 Then pledge unto me thy loyalty!
Hahahaha!
 Knowest thou my power? Methinks we that
bear such gifts are oft robbed of the
fruits of long life.

 What meanest thou? Dost thou desire my

Thine ability considered, that is
natural.
 I have misunderstood thee. I failed to
give thy discretion the faith 'tis owed.
  I despise such adulation!
  Thinkest thou that I am blind to thine
intentions!? Mock me no further!
Then pledge unto me thy loyalty!
Hahaha!
   Knowest thou my power? Methinks we that

   Thou art quite eccentric. I, however,
am offended not.
 Methinks I shall be treated to tea.
  Children are scoundrels!
   Churl, thy actions are in haste! The
proper procedure cannot be ignored!
 DUMMY1
 DUMMY2
 Haha, I am betrothed to another.
I beg thy forgiveness.
O, the anguish...
Thou desirest my attentions so? Thou
art quite winsome.
Thy story is childish, but I see why
thou playest the fool.
How unpleasant thy words are to mine
ear.
  More matter, less art. What dost thou
mean?
  Methinks there is a draft... I shiver.
 This carries the stench of suspicion.
Thou art a treacherous man...
  O, how merry. Mine eyes tideth over with
sweet tears of mirth.
 Hahaha, how amusing! Not so much as thy
face, however...
 I see... The human world yieldeth not for
its own denizens.
Continue thy tale.
   Such stories art the offspring of idle
minds! Dost thou not have a tale more
worthy?
   This is an ill time for idle chatter!
Thou art much too composed!
Then later, I shall relate to thee a
story of interest.
No matter the era, women are ever drawn
to scandals, and scandals to women...
Thou desirest my attentions so? Thou
art quite winsome.
Methinks I heard thee not.
   Wh-What!? 'Twould be folly to startle
me like that again!
  What art thou doing, scoundrel!?
 Eeeeek! What madness is this!?
 I shall take no action... Calm thy
nerves...
 A gift for me? A commendable endeavor
indeed.
  Dost thy wealth extend beyond the depth
of thy coinpurse? I would have more.
 Thou wouldst lure me with trifles?
I shall not be taken by them.
   I would have prefered something of
greater importance...
 Never in my life have I recieved such a
gift!
  'Tis pleasant to be given such favors!
   What thou sayest is rational...
I see, thou may appear young, but thou
hast endured many trials. Thy words

  Thou art an extortionist, knave? I have
no coin for thee.
  Hm? That scowl...
Thy speech treads deep in the realm of
absurdity... However, I forgive thee.
   If thou desirest longevity, 'twould be
prudent to learn courtesy.
Hahaha, I scoff at the notion! A child
such as thee thinks to oppose me?
   Knave, I have lived many a century more
than thee! Hold thy tongue!
  To recieve such praise gladdens me.
Thou art quite adept...
  I, too, specialize in dance! But 'tis
perhaps too bewitching for the eyes of
ones so young.
Were I to learn from thee, would I be
able to perform such feats of dance?
   'Tis beyond imagination that thou
wouldst display such a crude dance!
I find thy dedication sorely lacking!
*cough* The toilet is hither...
  Such elegance! Allow me to join thee!
  Let our cheer and merriment endure until
the morning sun shines!
 Thou hast confidence. A battle with thee
would be most enjoyable.

  Hm? That scowl...
Hast thou spied something on my face?
  Is it thine intention to pierce me with
thy fixed stare?
 Why dost thou glare? I like this
not...
What art thou looking at!? Hast thou
no manners, villain!?
   Thou art fascinated by me, art thou not?
I sympathize, but...
  What ails thee? Am I the first
beautiful maiden thou hast lain eyes
upon?
What thou sayest is rational...
I see, thou may appear young, but thou
hast endured many trials. Thy words

  Speak not such nonsense!
   Thou speakest of such uncanny things...

subjects? Art thou interested in me...?
 What meanest thou? Dost thou desire my
power?
Thou art irrational to put stock in
such childish notions.
 Thou thinkest me no different than such
fiends!?
 O, what terror... P-Please, no more...
 They sayeth, "Speak of the devil..."
What canst thou hope to accomplish with
such foul creatures abound?
 Tales of my comrades inspire far
greater terror! For after all, they are
real!
 Thou seemest quite learned in this
subject. Wilst thou not exchange more
harrowing tales with me on the morrow?
  A fine voice indeed... Thou art skilled,
young lady.
   I must confess, I, too, am skilled in
the art of song. What sayest thou to
a duet with me?
   A fine voice indeed... But let us change
the tune... I would have thy screams!
 Dost thou mean to challenge the bearer
of the netherworld's sweetest voice?
Consider the gauntlet thrown!
Haha... Thou canst match me not, but
it doth suffice.
  Hmmm...
  Hahaha, what is this? It is rather
delightful!
 Hahaha, do I truly look so young? 'Tis
not unappreciated...
  Thou art envious of my beauty! Women
can be base and sinful creatures.
 Insolent rogue! Thou art not of standing
to speak to me in such a fashion!
   I am reminded of days long past...
 Hahaha, how amusing!

Thou dost display sound reason to seek
courtship with me. Thou art truly one

   That is... too cruel. O, woe...
Wh-What!? Never have I been subjected
to an act of such cruelty...
   Thou art quite eccentric. I, however,
am offended not.
 Methinks I shall be treated to tea.
  Children are scoundrels!

 Haha, I am betrothed to another.
I beg thy forgiveness.
O, the anguish...
Thou hast seen many a trying time...
   How pitable. Take heart.
 Hmph. Do not take me for a fool! Thy
tears lack the brine of authenticity!
 Now I see why thou art known as
ჳ, the Weeping Crocodile among we
demons.
Please, banish thy tears. The human
world is one of many terrors...
Thou needst not thy tears...
 Thou hast confidence. A battle with thee
would be most enjoyable.

   I beg thy pardon...
This is much too cruel! Tell me, how
have I offended thee?
   Please, show mercy...
  I admit, 'tis my most secret desire to
be tormented so! Please... do as thou
wilt.
   What thou sayest is rational...
I see, thou may appear young, but thou

   Haha... Thou art a confident woman.
I admit, 'tis my most secret desire to
be tormented so! Please... do as thou
wilt.
   Thou hast confidence in spades... yet
I cannot help but wonder how easily it
it shaken...
  What? Hast thou no business with me?
 Thy confidence runneth over... Yet thou
hast chosen the wrong opponent!
Thou heedest me not? Then thou hast
underestimated me!
   ...I have committed no wrongs...
At least, I do not believe I have...
  Pardon me, o wanderer...

Wh-What!? I was startled...
What art thou doing, scoundrel!?
 Eeeeek! What madness is this!?
 I shall take no action... Calm thy
nerves...
 Thou art quite eccentric. I, however,
am offended not.
 Thou art no ordinary fellow... Perhaps
thou art my type...
   Thou desirest my attentions so? Thou
art quite winsome.
Art thou a practicioner of the dark
arts? I shall request a water illusion
of thee.
  What strange powers thou commandest...
 Dost thou mean to smite me with thy
arcane forces?
   Canst thou conjure objects? I wish for
a jewel...
  I wouldst liken thy skill to that of the
famed magician of thy world... Houdini,
was it not?
 Hahaha, thy story inspires laughter.
   More matter, less art.
 Conversing with thee is most enjoyable,
but hast thou anything greater to offer?
  I shall hear thee! I would not wish
regret upon one who comes so close to
departing the mortal coil.
   I am not the least bit interested!
 If thou wouldst have an audience with me,
there is something to be done first!
...Thou speakest as though possessed
by spirits...
 I understand thy words, but due to
circumstances thou couldst not percieve,
I must decline...
  Thy stories hold great interest. It
hath been ages since words hath
refreshed me so.
   Hahaha, a ploy such as that to garner
my attention? How amusing...
 Hahaha, I am quite amused... I desire
to speak with thee further...
I can see thy true intentions like a
pool of clear water... Thou art
interested in me, art thou not?
   Thou art shrewd to take notice of my
power!
I am wont to concede to thy wishes, but
first... Hast thou anything to offer me?
  Thou art but a commoner! Know thy place!
   Dost thou know me!? I am the almighty
<Name> the ჴ!
I have no intentions of negotiating
with humans!
   How presumptuous! 'Tis my orders that
are to be followed, not thine!
  I could lend thee power, but due to
circumstances thou couldst not percieve,
I must decline...
 I can see thy true intentions like a
pool of clear water... Thou desirest
my fortune...
'Tis my decision not to lend thee my
strength...
   Thou desirest me? How adorable! I could
swallow thee right up!
 Hahaha... Carry on.
Hahaha... It seems my charms hath not
fallen victim to time!
   Is it thine intention to rouse my anger?
Perhaps thou hast reason I cannot
fathom...
   'Twas hardly an action worthy of a demon
negotiator. Stay thy rage.
What child's play...
If thou desirest my favors, there is but
one way... Thou knowest it, yes?
   I shall exact punishment upon impudent
fools such as thee!
 Because thou art an insolent knave,
I can smite thee without reserve!
  How uncouth! I am wont to punish such
impudent foolery!
If thou art frightened at the thought,
pacify me with treasure!
  Such vulgar acts thou choosest to
display in my presence...
How uncouth... Woe is me, thou hast
roused my *hic* chronic *hic* hiccups...
   Insolent knave...
  Conceited, yet rather adorable...
  Excellent! 'Tis best to do what suits
thee whilst thou art young.
  Haha, bravo! Children should be raised
in such an environment.
 The curtain of inexperience hangeth upon
thy act. With effort, thou shalt master
it. Lose not thy faith.
   I would see that once more when thou
hast improved...
  Thou hast much to learn... If thou
wouldst have my lessons, I shall require
proper payment.
   I am unamused...
   Pathetic...!
   Didst thou plan to charge a fee for
that!? 'Tis I who deserve a fee!
  I do not understand...
 Is that some manner of witchcraft?
 Thou art well-versed in thine art...
I am impressed.
   Perhaps 'tis I who should request
lessons of thee.
 Ah! One more time!
 They say no good cometh hence from
humans, but... I find myself intrigued.
 Thou desirest to take me with thee?
Thinkest thou hast the requisite
confidence to fetter me?
  If thou wouldst have my trust, thou
wouldst do well to produce something
to dazzle mine eyes.
 Those who would mock me shall pay
with their lives!
Thou wouldst have me twist the
dagger into the backs of my sisters
for that!? Never!
   What would become of thee were my
brethren to hear of this!? If thy
desire is to silence me, then...
  Wh-What art thou doing? I... I shall
apologize, so...
  What wouldst thou do with me after
that...? Someone, save me...!
   Why dost thou treat me so...?
  Hahaha...
  Ah, thy resolution is admirable...
 I know that is not thy true
intention... Yet... perhaps it is my
desire to be deceived by thee...
  I know not thy wishes, but thou art
not so weak as to rely on such... base
strategies.
 'Tis well. I favor those who know their
place.
 Well, thou weren't a match for me from
the onset!
  I am of noble lineage... Thou cannot
hope to fool me with such antics!
 Thou wishest not to rouse my fury, dost
thou? Then listen well!
   What hath come over thee? ...Something
is amiss...
 Thou art truly angered, art thou not?
Then speak thusly...
 Hahaha! Humans are but slaves of demons!
   Hahahahahaha! Now beg for mercy!
  So rumors of me hath graced the ears of
even the lowly humans... Thou shouldst
offer me something.
Thou hast my spell card, I see. Keep it
safe.
  Take this.
 Oh, you speak truly?
   Unfortunate as it may be, our tastes
are ill-aligned.
  ...I grow weary of thy arrogance.
...Thou art much too weak.
   Then at least...
   Until we meet again.
   Take more!
 I must be on my way.
   If thou wouldst make me a Persona,
grant me both strength and beauty.
  I cannot bear it! I shall give this
unto thee. Please forgive me!
  If negotiatons with thee are of no
value, then I shall take my leave.
  Take this and begone!
  What a vile stench thou must have...
Hmm... What to do...?
 I grow weary of thinking! I shall give
thee my spell card and be done with it!
 There art no bonds stronger than fate...
Thou shalt be my master evermore...
   This is my spell card... I pray it
serves thy purpose well...
  To fight thee would be an act of
betrayal to fate itself!
  Take this, and hold it close to thee as
a keepsake of our encounter...
 No... I must find a way to survive...
  ...I know! I shall give unto thee my
spell card, in hopes that it subdue thy
anger...
  Hahaha... What business doth a human
have here?
  Haha, humans wear such eccentric
raiments...
   Thou art the first human I have met...
Wouldst thou honor me with a keepsake?
 Thou art an obstruction in my path!
Remove thyself, now!
 I am rife with choler this day. Makest
thou an ill move, and I shall tear thy
throat from 'neath thy head!
 I stand before thee, yet thou dost
nothing! Canst thou not even present
me with a gift!?
  Mark me well, beyond where thou standest
is my territory...
  My, how thy face hath contorted... Thou
lookest ill, and I shall grant thee no
favors...
   Thy face is one to be reviled...
I daren't use the toilet alone this
eve...
Haha, a beautifully rounded moon shineth
this eve. But lunar cycles aside, how
dost thou fare?
   Hahaha, 'twould gladden my heart to
drink fine mead and take in a dance!
   Were I to be offered a gift from a
winsome lad, I would be most merry!
To think that thou wouldst answer my
question! What dost thou desire? If it
be nothing, I shall take my leave!
  If thou hast business with me, thou
shouldst be the one to make it known!
 ...Thou art entirely incompatible with
me! A wastrel of a human, thou art!
So be it... If thou offerest me a
gift, I might be persuaded to enter
negotiations with thee.
Pardon me, but if the conversation hath
run its course, may I take my leave?
...Another savage human... Whatever
shall I do? Luck doth forsake me on
these moonless nights...
  Violence is an ill retort, and only
those of addled minds resort to steel.
Hahaha, I wish to abandon my station
and go with thee... Were I to say that,
what wouldst thou do?
  Hahaha, even encounters of chance are
guided by fate.
 If it is thy desire, I shall hear thee
further. That is, with a proper gift...
   Monster! Come n-no closer!
  What darkness doth I espy that gathers
behind thee? N-No, keep it at bay!
 In order to live, I must take life!
Thou mustn't fault me...
  Thou and I art as day is to night. A
world of difference exists betwixt us!
Dost thou understand?
   Thou knowest not the proper way to
speak to a lady. 'Tis written on thy
face like a birthmark!
My question is answered... And I see
that thou hast brought a symbol of
surrender!
   Thy gaze is sharp as needles... What
dost thou plan to do with me?
  Though I close mine eyes, thine image
remains clear as day. Why is this...?
   O, what art thou doing...? Nay... I mind
not whatever thou dost unto me...
Thou art a human of interest! Very well,
I shall grant thy wishes; you have only
to ask them.
  Hm, it seems negotiations with humans
are a waste of time. I shall tear thy
body asunder!
  How frightful... Is this where my
ashes are to be scattered?
   What a grand moment we've shared! Thou
hast stolen my heart...
 I have not time to spare thee, so keep
thy negotiations swift! If thou hast
business, state it thusly!
 Thou art a dreadful sort... I did not
say I would hear thee...
Tell me thy desires.
   The moment that hath just passed carried
more meaning than a fortnight! 'Tis for
thee, I shall be glad to oblige.
  What evil is this? My skin shivers
as though 'twere ice, yet mine eyes
boil with choler!
What hath become of me? Will I be slain
by thee where I stand, my tomb marked
only by the wild posies?
   ...Hmm, I grow weary of toying with
thee. Thou hast outlived thy use!
  ...I understand. Our encounter was
fated...
Then I shall take ჵ<Amount>.
  I thank thee...
I am not so foolish as to barter with
beggars and paupers!
 How pathetic...
Hmph! It seemeth I have been taken for
the halfwit fool upon a stage!
  No matter how deep thy coinpurse, thy
fortune shalt not follow thee beyond
the grave.
  I think I should like a life stone.
I shall cherish this.
  What!? Thou wouldst negotiate with
naught a single life stone!? This
offense wounds me deeply!
 What?! Thou wouldst negotiate with
demons and carry naught a single life
stone!? Thou art a foolish human!
 Life stones are wasted on thee as
fine wine is wasted on curs!
 A covetous human... However, survival
dictates necessity. Perhaps 'tis
natural to become as thou art...
Then I shall have a !
 A devilish stone that bewitcheth even
demons... Hahaha...
  Hmm... Next time it shan't end like
this.
  Dost thou mean to imply I am unworthy
of it!? Curse thee, human!
   Dost thou mean to imply I am unworthy
of it? Hmph... So be it...
   Give unto me some of thy life...
   Haha, I fancy obedient humans...
   'Tis a shame, but I shan't relent!
 'Tis a shame...
Hmph! That is not thy true intention!
  That maketh thee so adorable.
  Art thou familiar with the phrase, "the
less spoken, the better"?
  Then all is well.
  Then this shalt not be settled without
a proper gift.
 I trust thee as I trust a sleeping
serpent!
Understood!
Oh, is that the truth of it? ...Cursed
human!
  I see... Thou needst this not...
   Thou speakest thusly after making such
threats? Thou art a vexing being.
   Ha! Art thou so confident?
 Ha, thou art not lacking in confidence.
That is correct. Thou must hone thy
devotion daily.
Haha... One's true colors reveal
themselves in due time.
   Hmph...! One's true colors reveal
themselves in due time.
  Thy kindness hath caught me off-guard.
 Conceited knave! Divine retribution
wilt smite thee!
   Conceited knave! Divine retribution
wilt strike thee down...
   Hmph... Is this thy true intention!?
   That maketh thee rather adorable.
  That is quite bewildering... But I shall
tell thee. I seek gifts.
 Then all is well.
  Then this shalt not be settled without
a proper gift.
 I trust thee as I trust a sleeping
serpent!
Never have I seen such an honest
villain...
Never have I seen such an honest
villain. Thou art an interesting one!
 All the more suspicious...
 Hmm... Thou art not wanting for
confidence...
  Haha, my spirit surgeth!
   Ha! How canst thou speak so shamelessly
when that was thy true intention!
  This one... Thou art no human...
   Oh, is that the truth of it!?
Adaptation can be dreadful.
  Hmph! Unlike thee, I have not grown
accustomed to it!
  Why hast thou stopped? Sound thy vocal
melodies once more, for my sake.
Were I to eat thy tongue, perhaps I too,
could sing as the nightingale...
  Haha, o that I could sing as thou
dost...
  Hmph... Is this thy true intention!?
   That maketh thee rather adorable.
  That is quite bewildering... But I shall
tell thee. I seek gifts.
 Then all is well.
  Then this shalt not be settled without
a proper gift.
 I trust thee as I trust a sleeping
serpent!
Understood!
Oh, is that the truth of it? ...Cursed
human!
  I see... Thou needst this not...
   Haha! It seemeth I have been taken for
the halfwit fool upon a stage.
  Hmph! It seemeth I have been taken for
the halfwit fool upon a stage!
  Thou art a woman possessed of great
strength!
  'Tis not true...
   Thou knowest not the barbs of sarcasm.
Is ignorance truly so blissful, human?
  Dost thou know nothing of the thorns
of sarcasm!?
  Haha, ordinary men cannot comprehend.
  Ordinary men cannot comprehend!
O, that I were naught but a nameless
flower such as thee...
Hmph... Is this thy true intention!?
   That maketh thee rather adorable.
  Art thou familiar with the phrase, "the
less spoken, the better"?
  Then all is well.
  Then this shalt not be settled without
a proper gift.
 I trust thee as I trust a sleeping
serpent!
Understood!
Oh, is that the truth of it? ...Cursed
human!
  I see... Thou needst this not...
   Ah, thy jest is frightful.
 Thou art clever indeed!
I was mistaken! Thou art but a jester!
 Haha, ordinary men cannot comprehend.
  Ordinary men cannot comprehend!
O, that I were naught but a nameless
flower such as thee...
Just for tea...!
   Thou darest to humiliate me!? Insolent
scallywag!
  Thy heart is steeped in craven cruelty
to embarrass me so...
   All things hath an order. One mustn't
be negligent.
Sometimes the use of adequate force is
desirable.
  Thinkest me not a vulgar woman...
  My kingdom that I might peer into thy
heart...
 Thou art in the right! There is little
gained from brooding!
   Wouldst thou have me tell thee that
this is fatally unamusing!?
Haha, wouldst thou have me tell thee
that this is fatally unamusing?
   This time, 'tis comical!
   No... Suspicion hangeth upon thee like
a leaden weight...
  I hath placed my trust in thee thus
far, but... So be it.
  So thou art indeed a spy!
  Hahaha, check thy temper; 'tis but a
jest.
 Hahaha, thou art lacking in knowledge.
 Methinks the space betwixt thy ears is
vacant. I deal not with the ignorant!
   Thou shouldst excercise more caution.
  ...I had business to attend to... But
what was it?
 Now that I think on it, we were in the
midst of a duel!
What a hopeless coward.
What language art thou speaking!? An
unruly brat, thou art.
What language art thou speaking? It is
Greek to me.
How vulgar...
  Oh my, how embarrassing...
 Hmph! Thou wouldst dare make a villain
of me!? The outrage!
Please, tell me!
   It vexeth me... Please, tell me!
   Even if thou were to relate it to
me...
Hahaha, I cannot fathom it!
Thou hast not the right to call me rude.
   If I am rude, then thou art a jester.
Be it so, a trinket from thee, jester.
  ...I feel relieved.
Wh-What...?
What is it!? I shan't waste time on
fools and churls!
  Thou art my golden goose!
  Thou art my golden goose. So...
   Hmm, I am loathe to admit it, but thou
art of sound temperment. I could rely on
thee.
  Thou art 100 years too young to
reprimand me!
  Not a soul in the last 100 years hath
dared to reprimand me...
 Is that so...? I thank thee.
   Hmph! 'Tis only natural that humans
desireth my heart!
 But of course.
 That was sarcasm, dolt!
That maketh thee rather adorable.
  Art thou familiar with the phrase, "the
less spoken, the better"?
  Then all is well.
  I trust thee as I trust a sleeping
serpent!
Understood!
Oh, is that the truth of it? ...Cursed
human!
  I see... Thou needst this not...
   You speak thusly after thou makest such
threats? Thou art a vexing being.
  Ha! Art thou so confident?
 Ha, thou art not lacking in confidence.
That is correct. Thou must hone thy
devotion daily.
Haha... One's true colors reveal
themselves in due time.
   Hmph...! One's true colors reveal
themselves in due time.
  Thy kindness hath caught me off-guard.
 Conceited knave! Divine retribution
will smite thee!
   Conceited knave! Divine retribution
will strike thee down...
   Thou art a conceited but honest child.
 Thou shouldst excercise caution!
   ...Oh! Upon further inspection, I find
thee quite gallant.
 Hmph! I hath half a mind to rip thy
tongue out!
Thy compliments are hollow! Thou hast
been hoisted by thine own petard!
Thy compliments are hollow. Thou art a
victim of thine own tricks, so I shall
take something as thy punishment.
   Foolish? Who dost thou speak of?
   Hahaha, 'tis only natural when one has
abilities such as mine.
 Dost thou mean to say I am not up to it?
Thou hast not the eye to judge!
   Nay, it is quite possible. I may appear
frail, but I am an able participant
in physical labors when required.
  Hahaha, 'twas jest! That is a dance,
correct?
  I thought as much, but 'twas so very
pathetic!
 Thou hast a body capable of great feats
of strength. I shall speak no more of
it...
Why dost thou stop? I beeseech thee,
continue thy dance!
   Why dost thou stop!? Hmph! Thou art a
sadistic human!
  You speak thusly after thou makest such
threats? Thou art a vexing being.
  Ha! Art thou so confident?
 Ha, thou art not lacking in confidence.
That is correct. Thou must hone thy
devotion daily.
Haha... One's true colors reveal
themselves in due time.
   Hmph...! One's true colors reveal
themselves in due time.
  Thy kindness hath caught me off-guard.
 Conceited knave! Divine retribution
will smite thee!
   Conceited knave. Divine retribution
will strike thee down...
   Thou speakest nonsense! Were a hole to
blemish my face, my beauty would fade!
  I trust thee as I trust a sleeping
serpent.
Haha, I was toying with thee. No harm
was meant...
 Hahaha, thou wanderest in the darkness
in search of love?
  I said only what was right...
  Thou art nothing short of ill-bred!
I shall teach thee manners!
Thou still art but a youth. Please,
forgive my oversight.
  Thou art a child who cannot even issue
a proper challenge! How laughable!
  Hahaha... It seemeth thou art
uncomfortable issuing a challenge.
   Hmph... Is this thy true intention!?
   That maketh thee rather adorable.
  Art thou familiar with the phrase, "the
less spoken, the better"?
  Then all is well.
  Then this shalt not be settled without
a proper gift.
 I trust thee as I trust a sleeping
serpent!
Understood!
Oh, is that the truth of it? ...Cursed
human!
  I see... Thou needst this not...
   Never hath I met a more insolent being
than thee...
Never hath I met a more insolent being
than thee!
  Thinkest thou so? Thou hast
disctinction worthy of my taking
something from thee.
 I can protect myself!
  Hahaha, if thou art protecting me, my
dear sister, we have naught to fear.
 D-Do not leave me behind...
Be that thy true intent? Thou canst
remain calm only because thou knowest
not the true fear of ghost stories...
How daring a woman thou art! I like
thee.
  Art thou hesitant? Women must be bold!
 O, thou knowest not thine own strength?
Then I have no further words for thee!
 Haha, thou wouldst stand up to me?
'Tis like the mouse before the lioness...
   Haha, that is for thine own sake.
  Hmm... Thou art not wanting for
confidence...
  Haha, my spirit surgeth!
   Ha! How canst thou speak so shamelessly
when that was thy true intention!
  Why hast thou stopped? Sound thy vocal
melodies once more, for my sake.
Were I to eat thy tongue, perhaps I too,
could sing as the nightingale!
Haha, o that I could sing as thou
dost...
  ...That was sarcasm, was it not!?
  Thou spit forth a most venemous
sarcasm! Thou art an insolent human!
   ...Why dost thou laugh? I do not
understand...
 Children these days know naught of
manners!
V-Very well... I apologize. Please speak
no ill of me...
   So the human race has those who inspire
laughter as well.
  How boring.
Hmph... Is this thy true intention!?
   That maketh thee rather adorable.
  That is quite bewildering... But I shall
tell thee. I seek gifts.
 Then all is well.
  Then this shalt not be settled without
a proper gift.
 I trust thee as I trust a sleeping
serpent!
Understood!
Oh, is that the truth of it? ...Cursed
human!
  I see... Thou needst this not...
   Thou art a conceited but honest child.
 Thou shouldst excercise caution!
   Children these days know naught of
manners!
V-Very well... I apologize. Please speak
no ill of me...
   Grrrr...!
  To find myself being comforted by an
ingrate such as this...
   Just for tea!
  Thou thinkest it too embarrassing to
drink tea with me!? How selfish a girl
thou art!
  Thou art opposed to having tea with me?
I cannot fathom why...
 All things hath an order. One mustn't
be negligent.
Thou art a spoilt child!
   Thinkest me not a vulgar woman...
  My kingdom that I might peer into thy
heart...
 Thou art in the right! There is little
gained from brooding!
   Yes, that is the spirit.
   ...Suxorz? Thy language is harsh and
incomprehensible! Desist from using it!
   The world is a place of cruelty...
 Hahaha, thou hast the makings of a
demon.
  So it was an act! I cannot condone the
use of tears as weapons!
So thy tears ran true... Forgivest
me...
   This is quite vexing...
There now, quell thy tears.
You speak thusly after thou makest such
threats? Thou art a vexing being.
  Ha! Art thou so confident?
 Ha, thou art not lacking in confidence.
That is correct. Thou must hone thy
devotion daily.
Haha... One's true colors reveal

   Hmph...! One's true colors reveal

  Thy kindness hath caught me off-guard.
 Conceited knave! Divine retribution
will smite thee!
   Conceited knave! Divine retribution
will strike thee down...
   Children these days know naught of
manners!
V-Very well... I apologize. Please speak
no ill of me...
   Thy mind's eye hath been twisted beyond
recognition...
 Thou art a demon...
Thou art a demon!
  I shall endure!
'Twould be too cruel to stop now!
  'Tis much too cruel... to stop now...
  'Twas sarcasm, dolt!
   That maketh thee rather adorable.
  Art thou familiar with the phrase, "the
less spoken, the better"?
  Then all is well.
  I trust thee as I trust a sleeping
serpent!
Understood!
Oh, is that the truth of it? ...Cursed
human!
  I see... Thou needst this not...
   Children these days know naught of

 Thou art a demon...
Thou art a demon!
  I shall endure!
'Twould be too cruel to stop now!
  'Tis much too cruel... to stop now...
  Ask me why I do not anger!
 Thou art a coward!
 Hahaha, thou art a timid one.
  I understand!
  What manner of remark is that, thou
irksome girl!?
 All is well!
   A wise traveler taketh note of the
sky, whilst a foolish traveler meets
a calamity in storms.
  ...Art thou feeling proper?
Thou knowest not a proper greeting!
Ask me why I do not anger!
 Thou art a coward!
 Hahaha, thou art a timid one.
  I understand!
  What manner of remark is that, thou
irksome human!?
All is well!
   What manner of remark is that, thou

 Conceited knave! Divine retribution

   Conceited knave! Divine retribution
will strike thee down...
   Ha, I understand it not!
   Then lower thy voice!
  Then nor do I.
 ...I feel relieved.
Wh-What...?
What is it!? I shan't waste time on
fools and churls!
  S-So it was... slightly different...
   'Twas different this time. I desire
for thee to put greater effort into it.
Thou art shrouded in mystery...
'Tis a shame... Practice and return
here once more.
Hurry! Thou must hurry and show me!
If I disappear... what shall become of
me? What shall be my fate!?
 If I disappear... what shall become of
me?
 Ah, that is correct. Fear not; I do
not think thee suspicious.
 I was correct!
 Oh... How droll!
   'Tis but a jest, is it not...?
 Haha, I shan't be fooled...
Hahaha... Moon watching on a night with
no moon at all. Quite taseful, thou
art.
   Hahaha, 'tis well.
 Children in these times!
   Hm? What sayest thou!? I hear nothing!
 Hm? I am in the way...? Thou sayest that
I, <Name> am in the way...?
A reasonable child.
I say 'tis my territory, and thus, 'tis
my territory!
  This is... my territory...
 Hmm... Thy question is difficult...
Perhaps I should reconsider...
 Thy fortitude is thine only trait to be
proud of.
  Hmm... Then take care of thy heart.
Wha... If thou art vomitting, please...
Turn away from my sight...
 The question hath changed.
 Oh, is that the truth of it? Then I
shall complete my duty and kill thee
before returning home!
Wh-What...?
I shall do thee no harm... By no means
shouldst thou mistake thyself...
I shall not leave simply because thou
commandest it!
   Then 'tis well. I shall leave soon
enough...
   N-Nothing...
   Hahaha, 'twas in jest.
 I see...
   Hmph! I know thy desire is to maketh
me thy Persona!
   Well... 'Tis impossible.
   ...Pardon me, I am fine now...
 E-Eeeeek!
hahaha...
  If thou understandest, begone!
 Hahaha... Hast thou a dictionary on
hand? Perhaps thou shouldst open it.
   Use a dictionary if thou must know!
Quite a merry one!
 I am a fool to hath believed!
  What a harrowing yet sweet sound!
  Why doth it need be kept secret...?
