彻 Ԃ ઢ ങ ച   蛳 Ἑ̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺̺You're right... I'm still young, too.
It makes me think.
   Hmph! What do you think you're up to?
As if you know how I've suffered!
I knew it! You're interested in me,
aren't you?
Let me guess... You're attracted to
women with large mouths!
  Goodness, you're rather confident.
Wanna put that to the test later on?
The nerve, taunting me! Don't make me
take off this mask!
  Wh-What's wrong with you...? Don't you
know how to speak to a lady...?
 Do you really need my help?
Aren't you just trying to join our group?
 Are you trying to sweet-talk me?
Hmph! I'm not falling for that!
   I'm not interested in people with small
mouths. Sorry... try someone else.
 What an amazing voice... It's so good,
I kind of hate it! Let's see what it
sounds like when it's screaming!
   Stop singing... I hate music.
  Wow, that's a great voice. You know,
I was a good singer in my day, too.
   Well... you're not using any product
in your hair, at least. I'll think
about it.
  Hmph! I bet you've rehearsed those lines
before on other demons!
You disgust me!
  Another favor? It seems like everyone's
been coming to me.
Ahaha... Beauty can be a sin.
  Don't you have any pride!? I hate women
like you!
  Come on, cut that out... It's creepy.
  Yes! Exactly! The homely and the plain
must kneel before me!
   Hmm... I usually don't believe people
unless they tell me I'm beautiful...
Well, maybe just this once, I'll let it
go and believe you.
You're lying your ass off! Don't make me
slice you to ribbons with my box cutter!
  Goodness... You want to spend time with
me so badly you'll lie to do it?
Ahaha... I've still got it.
  Ah, you seem to know your limitations.
That's a very important thing to get by
in this world.
 What's your problem!? You make me
sound like a monster or something!
Now I'm really ticked off!
That's right! Next time, bring me candy!
   Huh? How old are you?
Ick... You're still a kid...
Your arrogance is jaw-closing.
 What does a brat like you want with me!?
You're not my type!
   Dummy.
 Am I beautiful!?
I'm beautiful, right!?
That's right! I AM beautiful!
Ahaha... You're cute.
It's a corny joke, but it's nice that
you're trying to get my attention.
Hey! My mouth hurts when I laugh!
You better not be doing that on purpose!
 Laaaaame...
That was pretty funny! Not as funny as
your face, though.
  Me? Let's see... I've been in a fix
lately. Kids are too careful nowadays.
 Hmmm... I haven't had much luck capturing
kids lately.
So I'll capture you instead...!
Umm, well... Rumor has it that humans who
hit on demons are extra delicious!
   Awww, how cute... Trying to get my
attention with a cheap gag like that...
 Uh, what's wrong with you? Are you an
idiot or something? How childish!
Wh-What was that for...? That was close.
My mask almost slid off...
Is that a present? For me? Hurry up
and gimme!
 Hey! You think this is going to sway me!?
You didn't give this much thought,
did you? What I want is candy!
Oh, my! It's been a while since I was
given a gift... How delightful!
  That speech was amazing! You must have
practiced in front of a mirror. I like
a man who works hard!
You talk big for a little kid! What a
smart-aleck...
   If you can speak that confidently, you
have a mouth well-suited to lip service!
It could surpass mine someday!
 Kids today really are lacking in calcium.
You should eat more candy.
  There's no reason to yell at me! This is
why I hate stupid brats!
  ...My time has already passed... I wonder
if I should just go into hiding.
 I don't really like kids. They can be
such smart-alecks... Will you really
grow into a handsome man someday? Mmm.
  You pretend to be mature, but you've got
a long way to go when it comes to
dealing with women!
 Oh, stop... you're embarrassing me...!
 Is that the takenoko? I was active in
the 70s... I don't know much about
modern dances.
Hmph! Your moves are best kept to
yourself, if you ask me. Come back
when you've had more practice!
Ahaha... You're pretty good! But if it
was a race, I'd win!
You seem pretty sure of yourself. I'm
always surprised by kids these days.
 You're one of those kids who never knows
when to shut up! How about if I slice
your mouth off, hmmm? What then!?
   Um... Um, all I do is ask, "Am I
beautiful?" you know...
...I'm not lying...
  Are you that curious to know what's under
this mask?
Ahahah... That'll have to stay a secret.
 What's with that look? It's getting on
my nerves a little!
 Hahah... I can tell you're enraptured.
It's not for nothing that they say
beauty can be a sin.
 You sure can hype yourself up... it's
really something. You're an interesting
kid, you know that?
  Hmph! Talking without thinking is a
terrible thing... Don't make me slit
that mouth apart!
 Ahahah... You don't have to lie just
because you're embarrassed. Lots of
people are interested in me.
  Hmph! The only creepy thing here is
your face!
 N-No! Stop it! Why did you tell me that!?
  I was the talk of the town, back in
the day. I'd like to slit your mouth
and make you famous, too.
 Wow, you have a wonderful voice. But if
you slit your mouth wider, you could
achieve an even greater range...
  You can out-sing me with that tiny
mouth...? I don't know how I feel
about that!
   Wow, that's a great voice you have.
Listening to you calms me down.
Now that's an interesting tactic!
I like playing house, too.
   Hey! Who do you think I am!? Cut it
out already!
   Strange... I feel so nostalgic all of
a sudden. I'm glad I met you.
Huh...? Do you really need me? Don't you
just want to be one of my sisters?
Hmph! I have my pride, you know! I'd
sooner cut my mouth even wider than
put myself in your care!
  Recently, I didn't even have anyone to
ask, "Am I beautiful?" so I was getting
lonely. You've made me a happy woman!
   Honestly... Kids your age are getting
way too precocious. Though I was like
that too when I was a delinquent...
Hey! Watch your mouth! What's with you?
Don't sass me, little girl!
Th-That's not true... Oh God... *sob*
  Are you actually trying to seduce me...?
Huh... I can't bring myself to hate you.
  Oh, is that so? Then feel the caress...
of my box cutter on your face!
 Ahahah... That's so cute.
  I didn't think there was anyone out there
with a fate worse than mine... I feel for
you from the bottom of my heart.
   Hmph! Boy, did you choose the wrong
person to try that on! I love nothing
more than making spoiled brats cry!
  Yeesh, stop crying... Your bad luck
will rub off on me.
Wow...! You're pretty self-confident!
People like you interest me.
 Hmph! Don't act all high and mighty when
you're really all talk! I'll give your
fresh mouth a good slashing!
   You seem pretty certain... *gasp*
You're not carrying any hair product,
are you...?
What a foulmouthed young lady! As a demon
governing mouths, I can't allow it!
  I... I'm sorry...
  Ahahah... An argument, eh? I never lose.
   Huh... You have a good head on your
shoulders. I'm impressed.
  Hmph! That smooth talk doesn't fool me!
You can't possibly understand my pain!
 So what it comes down to is... you want
my spell card, right? Hahah... it's not
easy being popular.
Hey! Will you stop trying to act like
an adult? Face it--you're just a brat!
And I must say, it's pissing me off!
  Is that so...? All right, I apologize...
   It's been a while since I had a tongue-
lashing like that! Hey, do it again!
   So that's how you wanna play it, huh?
Alright, let's see who has more guts!
Hey! Look at me! If you don't look, how
can you tell if I'm pretty or not!?
If a kid like this won't take me
seriously, I think I'm sunk...
Oh, so that's how it's going to be?
Well, okay then. I'll join in this
little battle of wills.
 Hey! Look at me! If you don't look, how
can you tell if I'm pretty or not!?
If a kid like this won't take me
seriously, I think I'm sunk...
Wow...! You're pretty self-confident!
Hmm... People like you interest me.
  Hmph! Don't act all high and mighty when
you're really all talk! I'll give your
fresh mouth a good slashing!
   You seem pretty certain... *gasp*
You're not carrying any hair product,
are you...?
Quiet, you! What are you trying to say!?
You've got a mouth, don't you? Then speak
properly!
   Wh-What's your problem? I think you've
had a little too much to drink...
   That sudden yell really caught me off
guard. Hahah... I can't stay mad, though.
Ooh! Can you make other things appear,
too? I like people who are good with
their hands!
   You really can do anything... Just don't
conjure up anything I hate.
   That's amazing! Hey, magic up some candy
for me next time!
 What an interesting story! C'mon, tell
me what happens next!
   You must be really interested in me!
Give me something and maybe I'll tell
you more about myself.
I'll listen to you, but isn't there
something you need to do first?
   This is no fun at all... What a letdown.
   Will you stop bitching about petty
stuff like that!?
Honestly, what a stupid child! You made
me angry... What are you going to give
me to fix it!?
   Will you quit yapping!? You made me
angry... What are you going to give
me to fix it!?
I don't like that look of yours...
Are you under something's control...?
   ...I don't think I get it as much as
someone else would...
 Ahahah... It's been a while since I had
such a nice time.
  Hahahah... You say such cute things!
   Why don't we chat some more! I'm hoping
you might give me a present!
  You want me? Teehee... What should
I do...?
Your opening gambit was interesting.
If you give something, I'll listen to
whatever you really wanted to say.
 You want my help, but you're still
a kid... Let me think it over some.
 I have no interest at all in kids
like you.
That was too... ordinary! You need to do
something that'll get my heart racing!
Hmph! What a lame tactic. I'm a
ผ <Name>, you know.
If you really want my help, you'll listen
to my commands!
 I feel like... there's something behind
all this...
Aren't you a human...? You shouldn't ask
for help from demons...
   If you have a favor to ask, some advice:
don't come to me. Ask some other demon...
 Ahahah... Now, what should I do...?
Ahahaha! You need me? What a kind thing
to say!
Why are you acting that way? Are you
deliberately trying to make me angry?
There's something up your sleeve...
 There's no point in trying to make me
angry. But I admit, you have a talent
for it.
That won't get you anywhere. There are
better ways to pique people's interest.
How dare you make fun of me!? I hope
you're prepared!
  Argh, you make me so mad! Though if you
didn't... I wouldn't take any pleasure
in killing you!
 How dare you make a fool out of me!?
Now I'm mad! And I won't calm down
unless you give me something!
 You must be making fun of me...
You're so cruel...
 This isn't how negotiations usually go...
  Wh-What the...? I can't figure out what
your negotiation strategy is...
Nice attitude... You must be very sure
of yourself! I like that!
   Sure, do whatever you want! I bet you
have no idea how scary I am!
Ask your older sister about me when you
get home... Hahaha! You'll be surprised!
   Ahaha... You're trying to figure out what
I like, aren't you? That's so adorable!
  Hmmm? Are you an aspiring performer?
Make sure to mention me when you hit
the big time.
You're not very good at this, are you?
We'll try again once you've had more
practice. I'm looking forward to it!
   I feel like something's missing...
I can give you tips, but it'll cost you!
   ...What was that? It was so lame, I think
you deserve to die for it!
   ...What was that? You suck so bad there's
no hope for you! For your next trick,
I think you should die!
...Wait... Give me something first!
  You want money for THAT!? Hmph, you got
some nerve! You should pay me instead!
What is that...? I don't get it...
 Is that some dangerous sorcery ritual?
It's got nothing to do with me, right...?
   Ahahah... That went quite well. You're
very attractive.
That was amazing! I wonder if I should
learn something, too...?
You really are a talented child.
I'm having lots of fun...
...And I'd have even more if you gave
me something, you know?
 Hahah... Is it all right if I leave
my mask on?
You're just a kid... But who knows?
It might be a good way to kill time.
Alright, I'll hang around. But you'd
better give me something in return!
Are you trying to hit on me? That's fine,
but I like someone who's generous!
  Are you making fun of me!? I can't stand
that in brats like you!
   I'm not stupid! You think I'd betray my
sisters just for that!?
Honestly, what a brat! You've made me
mad... What are you going to give me
to fix it!?
   What're you doing? Wait... you're not
trying to seduce me, are you!?
If the other demons find out you seduced
me, they'll mob you! I'll keep quiet,
though... for a price...
 Hey, what's wrong? I haven't done
anything...
  Hey, wait a second... Even after hearing
that story, I-I-don't know what to do...
  Ahahah...
  Not bad! But you know what'd be even
better? If you gave me something!
I think... I'm falling for you...!
 You're good at making your way in life.
That's right! You understand how scary
I am, don't you?
In that case, give me something!
 Smart kid.
 Why even say something so obvious!?
You can't even approach my perfection!
 If you think that'll make me forgive you,
you have another thing coming!
Honestly, what a brat! You've made me
mad... What are you going to give me
to fix it!?
  You're my slave now! I'll need a gift to
be interested in you, slave!
 You're scheming something, aren't you...?
  Aren't you actually angry...? You are,
right? I knew it... you're mad...
   Ahahah... I'll play nice with honest
children.
 You're a good kid... You're so cute,
it makes me want to rip you apart and
see your beautiful entrails. Ahaha...
   Oh...! You have my sister's spell card...
Don't make it into a weird Persona, okay?
Well then, I'll give you this.
 What? Seriously!?
  I'm Kuchisake-onna. I came about when a
stupid student in Hokkaido made up my
story on a radio program.
Not every demon has a cool origin.
Mine really sucks.
 ...I'm not that gullible.
Let's negotiate again when you're a
little stronger.
Well, anyway, take this to commemorate
our meeting.
Goodbye... I hope we meet again.
   This isn't much... but take it.
I'm... busy, so I'll get going.
Even if I become a Persona, you better
still tell me how beautiful I am, three
times a day! Promise me!
Please! Forgive me! I'll give you this...
  I'm tired of negotiating with you!
You never do anything interesting!
  I'm tired of negotiating with you!
You're just a child... Take this and
run along home now.
In exchange for this, I want candy!
Huh...? You don't have any!?
   You really piss me off! Ugh, screw it!
Here, just take my spell card!
  Wow... I think this is the first time
I've negotiated with someone as strong
and funny as you...
   This is just a token of my gratitude...
I hope you find it useful.
 I can't fight you...
   This is for you... Please take good care
of it...
  But... will you let me go, no strings
attached...?
 If you forgive me, I'll give you my
spell card...
  Oh my, what a handsome man...
Hey, do you have anything against
demons with big mouths...?
 Hey, listen! I haven't lived as a human
in a while. That's why I want something.
  I'll tell you now, I'm in a bad mood
today! Try anything funny and I'll rip
you apart!
 What a beautiful full moon! And here I am,
the only demon girl stuck negotiating
with humans... Sheesh!
So, got any presents for me? Ugh! You're
so inconsiderate! Give me something!
Wh-What a scary face... D-Don't cross
that line, okay...?
  Wh What a scary face... I-I don't think
I'll be able to sleep tonight...
   Nights with a full moon get me so
excited! I wish they could go on
forever!
It's a full moon... Haha... Hah...
If I can get something from you, I'll
have no complaints.
  I would've been happier if you'd talked
to me first! You're such a sissy.
 That's... kind of a letdown...
Oh well. If you give me something, I'll
still listen to what you have to say.
You... You have the scent of blood
on you...
Ugh... I always get the weird ones...
   You... You have the scent of blood
on you...
Look, let's talk. There's no need to
do anything creepy...
  You... me... Our meeting like this could
be destiny.
How about a little something to mark the
occasion? Please...?
  Oh! What a handsome man... Now's my
chance! Let's negotiate!
  I-If you kill me, my sisters won't take
it lying down! Got it...?
 You look like you've killed demons
before... Depending how this negotiation
goes, I might not forgive you for that...
 Hey! What's the big idea, answering
my call!?
There's no way you're good enough for me!
Maybe it'd be a different story if you
had a gift, but...
   Why'd YOU respond? I'm not interested in
children without an ounce of brains.
Hahahah...
  I feel so odd... Please do whatever you
want with me! I don't care what!
  I-I'm scared of you... but I'm also
hoping for something... What's gotten
into me...?
 You're pretty interesting! So what is it
you want? I'm in the mood to listen.
  Even if I keep hanging around you,
I doubt I'll get anything out of it!
I feel like I've wasted my time!
   ...I guess I should go now...
  Haha... That was lots of fun. You're good
at pleasing demons.
  I'm a little ticked off, but maybe this
is fate, too... What do you want?
  ...I'll listen. There's no need to
be cruel...
 Ahahah... I'm glad I ran into you.
Whatever you want, it's yours!
  Ugh! I'm pissed off AND I got the chills!
What the hell!
What did I ever do to you!?
I'm beautiful!
   There's no point in negotiating any more.
It's not like I have all the time in the
world to waste with you.
This is great, but... scary, too...
Maybe it'd be best if I just did what
you asked...
 Let's see, I want... <Amount> yen.
Ahahah... Thanks.
  Hey!? You don't even have THAT much!?
Your wallet is like postwar Japan...
 Hey! If you can't even afford that,
how do you expect to negotiate with
demons!?
   What's the use hoarding all that money?
It'll all be mine eventually anyway!
   ...If you didn't want to negotiate,
you should've said so at the start...
  I want a life stone...
 It's not as good as candy, but this stone
is still delicious...
What!? It's just common sense to carry
life stones with you!
   Wait, you were negotiating with me and
you didn't have ANY life stones!?
Oooh, you make me soooo mad!
  What did you say!? Giving you a life
stone would just be wasting it!
   You were negotiating without any life
stones? You've gotta be kidding me...
I don't believe this...
Ahahah... I know you have a
... I want one!
   This shine... No matter how I look at it,
it's still so marvelous...
   Hey! Doesn't that seem unfair to you?
  Oh, really... Then I'll just have to
take it by force!
 ...I didn't want it anyway.
I prefer candy.
I want your life... Even just a little
bit will be fine. C'mon... just a sip?
  Ahahah... Your vital energy is
delicious!
  Oh my... Are you scared of me? I'm even
scarier to children who don't listen!
  No way... I know I have a large mouth,
but that's so cruel! You're terrible!
   No way... I know I have a large mouth,
but that's so cruel! You're terrible!
