Since you require my intervention,
your point is indeed reasonable.
You have a great deal of foresight.
Young though you are, you are both
admirable and reliable.
   Do you truly require my intervention?
There is no sincerity in your speech
and actions!
As a redeemed human, you must speak only
the truth!
Pursuing personal gain and deceitfully
hiding your true intentions will only
anger Him!
 Your instincts are right to be interested
in me... Now turn your heart to the Lord
and let us walk a path of righteousness!
Do you wish to form a contract with me,
one of His messengers?
   You are overflowing with confidence.
Should the chance ever arise, I would
like a personal match with you.
 I understand now your strength...
But what will you do with me?
  I shall mend your twisted mind for
your own sake!
  Where did you learn to speak such filth?
 I am an angel; His own messenger...
I do not yield to threats.
 As one of His messengers, you must attend
to me with respect.
Since you require my intervention,
your point is indeed reasonable.
You have a great deal of foresight.
Young though you are, you are both

   Do you truly require my intervention?
There is no sincerity in your speech
and actions!
As a redeemed human, you must speak only
the truth!
Pursuing personal gain and deceitfully
hiding your true intentions will only
anger Him!
 An invitation from a fallen one...?
You demon-ridden human...!
 ...I believe there are others better
suited than I...
  Though you try to appease angels with
such songs, His order will not be
swayed!
An enchanting singer who seduces souls...
Humans are indeed dangerous creatures.
They cannot be left unshepherded!
   I cannot bear to listen any longer...
This must be a form of ordeal...
 Your song is not pleasing to His ears...
S-Stop at once...!
  Ah, such singing is truly the music of
the spheres!
That voice must be a gift from Him, no?
I am deeply moved...!
Since you require my intervention,
your point is indeed reasonable.
You have a great deal of foresight.
Young though you are, you are both

   Do you truly require my intervention?
There is no sincerity in your speech

 Your instincts are right to be interested
in me... Now turn your heart to the Lord
and let us walk a path of righteousness!
Do you wish to form a contract with me,
one of His messengers?
   That will change nothing! You must cling
fast to your beliefs to live your life!
   What an obvious charade... Your true
intentions are known to me!
 I feel there must be some catch to
this... How uncanny...
  Oh, not at all... I still lack experience
as one of His messengers.
  Very true! Obedience to me is indeed the
first step on the path to redemption!
 So you instinctively sensed that an
almighty, transcendent entity is
enthroned in the heavens!
   Since you have been redeemed, your point
is indeed reasonable.
 You have a great deal of foresight.
Young though you are, you are both
admirable and reliable.
   Do you truly wish to form a contract?
There is no sincerity in your speech
and actions!
As a redeemed human, you must speak only
the truth!
Pursuing personal gain and deceitfully
hiding your true intentions will only
anger Him!
 Speaking of the world is a good habit...
You have turned your heart to the Lord,
and you walk the path of righteousness!
   Do you wish to form a contract with me,
one of His messengers?
   To be humble, avoiding conflict...
That is desirable in humans who have
been banished from paradise.
   Though you had been banished from
paradise, you have a keen understanding
of your true strengths.
That will change nothing! You must cling
fast to your beliefs to live your life!
   What an obvious charade... Your true
intentions are known to me!
 I feel there must be some catch to
this... How uncanny...
  Oh, not at all... I still lack experience
as one of His messengers.
  You are a pleasant human...
You wish to converse with me? Shall I
teach you about the Lord, mankind,
and love?
   How dare you, towards an angel and one
of His messengers! Be ashamed!
  It is useless to try and deceive me.
Such things should not be so easily said
in the first place!
I-I... am neither male nor female...
   S-Stop this! Upsetting the peace and
order is a grave offense!
   It does not shame me to hear this...
But until the fated day on which we form
a contract, remember those words well.
   Your invitation may be an ordeal from
Him as well... What should I do?
   If you wish to draw my attention, you
need only praise Him on high with your
hand to heart.
Fools can be unexpectedly wise... You may
be one who makes up peace and order
as well...
   Your jest is utterly lacking in wit!
   What about that pointless story was meant
to be humorous?
Ah! I'm getting goosebumps... It must be
divine intervention...
What is the meaning of this...? Are you
entirely mentally balanced?
  That was not a poor effort for one who
had been banished from paradise.
You are talented indeed! Would you
consider becoming a comedic missionary
to spread His truth across the world?
  I am interested in the human world's
state of affairs as well.
 I ask this not of personal interest...
But do you know any stories that are
more engaging?
   These vulgar stories hold no interest for
His messengers!
  I am aghast... Are you truly making small
talk during a discussion of contracts?
You must take this seriously!
   What a pleasant story. Perhaps later,
I shall relate firsthand accounts of
Heaven to you.
  I must listen to your story, that I might
learn more about humans who had been
banished from paradise...
 If you wish to draw my attention, you
need only praise Him on high with your
hand to heart.
Was that divine intervention...?
What was that?
  Do you enjoy surprising His messengers
this way?
   Is it given unto me that I must guide
such a fool...?
What a dangerous human... No, I...
I am not afraid... you know...
  With His protection, I fear nothing.
Thus, I am not afraid... You see...?
I can scarcely believe it would occur
to you to behave that way in the
presence of one of His messengers.
  That is prudent of you. The rich should
give their wealth to the poor.
   You think to control me with material
goods? You are unworthy of salvation!
Ahem... It is important to ascertain
what others desire as well.
 So that is your offering to Him? Your
generosity is indeed admirable.
  Thank you very much. I shall use it
with care.
   Since you have been redeemed, your point
is indeed reasonable.
 You have a great deal of foresight.
Young though you are, you are both
admirable and reliable.
   Do you truly require my intervention?
There is no sincerity in your speech
and actions!

   You are overflowing with confidence.
Should the chance ever arise, I would
like a personal match with you.
 I understand now your strength...
But what will you do with me?
  I shall mend your twisted mind for
your own sake!
  Where did you learn to speak such filth?
 I am an angel; His own messenger...
I do not yield to threats.
 As one of His messengers, you must attend
to me with respect.
You speak as though you make sport of
me... You are but a child, so I am
sure He will forgive your indiscretion.
   Those who forget their manners make
needless enemies!
Barbed words hurt not only others, but
can be turned upon yourself!
How old do I appear to you? Suffice to
say I am older than you, so speak to me
in a more appropriate manner!
 Your words of praise... I am certain
that He is pleased with them.
 It seems that you are a quick thinker,
if nothing else.
  I would like to show you the dance of
we heavenly creatures someday.
   That is quite a dance. I would like you
to teach it to me as well.
   You seem to lack training. Your dancing
is a form of ordeal... You must not
neglect your practice!
 How unsightly! The restroom is that way!
 Your dance is an expression of the joys
of living! Magnificent! I feel as though
I would like to join in!
  Your dance is an expression of the joys
of living! Well then, let us dance
together!
 You are overflowing with confidence.
Should the chance ever arise, I would
like a personal match with you.
 I understand now your strength...
But what will you do with me?
  I shall mend your twisted mind for
your own sake!
  Where did you learn to speak such filth?
 I am an angel; His own messenger...
I do not yield to threats.
 As one of His messengers, you must attend
to me with respect.
Is something the matter with my face?
I endeavor to construct the proper
expressions while in the human world.
 If you observe me that closely, your
eyes may bore a hole in me!
 That defiant look is unacceptable!
 You must not look that way at one of
His messengers!
 What is the matter? You look bewildered.
   What is the matter? Have you never seen
someone of my beauty before? Ahaha...
Since you have been redeemed, your point
is indeed reasonable.
 You have a great deal of foresight.
Young though you are, you are both
admirable and reliable.
   Do you truly require my intervention?
There is no sincerity in your speech
and actions!
As a redeemed human, you must speak only
the truth!
Pursuing personal gain and deceitfully
hiding your true intentions will only
anger Him!
 This contract is based on my conjecture...
You have turned your heart to the Lord,
and you walk the path of righteousness!
 Do you wish to form a contract with me,
one of His messengers?
   That is a lie, spread by the wicked!
It is foolish of you to believe it!
   That was not a harmonious story. Why do
humans enjoy stories of disrupting peace
and order!?
 H-Hold a moment... I must hence to
the lavatory...
 To be plain... I do not deal well with
such stories...
   If you speak of such things, they will
gather near you. Look... There is one
behind you now!
Ahaha... Were you frightened? If you
obey Him, these things will no longer
trouble you.
  You seem very familiar with that. Are
there dreadful places in such utter
disorder here too?
 Magnificent! You are one graced with
both intelligence and beauty.
 How marvelous! Had I not been an angel,
I would have succumbed to your charms.
   Though you try to appease angels with
such songs, His order will not be
swayed!
An enchanting singer who seduces souls...
Humans are indeed dangerous creatures.
They cannot be left unshepherded!
   Ah, such singing is truly the music of
the spheres!
That voice must be a gift from Him, no?
I am deeply moved...!
What is it? Rather, "what ish it, mommy?"
Is that how I was meant to say it?
   Ahaha... Angels do not age, but do I
look so young to you?
   Ever since the redemption of humanity,
they have become quite insolent!
That must now be corrected!
How deplorable! Do you not even know
your place!?
I feel as though I experienced something
like that in the world gone by...
 Is the mother of life one like you?
  Since you require my intervention,
your point is indeed reasonable.
You have a great deal of foresight.
Young though you are, you are both
admirable and reliable.
   Do you truly require my intervention?
There is no sincerity in your speech
and actions!

   Those who forget their manners make
needless enemies!
Ever since the redemption of humanity,
they have become quite insolent!
That must now be corrected!
How deplorable, not to even know
your place!
 When you put it that way... I-I become
less sure of myself...
  I cannot believe you would speak that
way to one of His angels... Oh Lord...
I am dreadful...
You are a pleasant human.
  You wish to converse with me? Shall I
teach you about the Lord, mankind,
and love?
   Sinful woman! Be ashamed of yourself!
  Why do you treat yourself so carelessly?
You are one of His unique creations!
Could this be an ordeal as well...?
But the circumstances are so delightful...
What... what should I do...?
My heart is wavering... Am I going to
be corrupted?
  This is an ordeal from Him! When you
overcome it, true happiness will
await you!
   Though you are young, you have been
through much hardship...
 How reckless of you to lie to an angel!
Know that you are well known for your
false tears!
   P-Please stop! At this rate, I will
appear to be a wicked angel...
 You are putting me in a difficult
situation, crying while we work out
a contract...
  You are overflowing with confidence.
Should the chance ever arise, I would
like a personal match with you.
 I understand now your strength...
But what will you do with me?
  I shall mend your twisted mind for
your own sake!
  Where did you learn to speak such filth?
 I am an angel; His own messenger...
I do not yield to threats.
 As one of His messengers, you must attend
to me with respect.
Ever since the redemption of humanity,
they have become quite insolent!
That must now be corrected!
How deplorable, not to even know
your place!
 Did I err...?
  Please, hold a moment!
Have I done something?
You must have been sent to test me!
This must be an ordeal as well! Hurl as
much abuse as you see fit!
   Since you have been redeemed, your point
is indeed reasonable.
 You have a great deal of foresight.
Young though you are, you are both
admirable and reliable.
   Do you truly wish to form a contract?

  Please, hold a moment! Have I done
something to offend you?
  You must have been sent to test me!
This must be an ordeal as well! Hurl as
much abuse as you see fit!
   The Lord may have some hidden reason
for your actions...
   What is the matter? Are we not going
to form a contract?
 So you ignore His messenger... I admire
your bravery, but it will not gain you
any clemency!
   You ignore me? It seems that you, too,
have been tainted by evil!
You disturb peace and order... You have
been tainted by evil.
  Ah... greetings?
 The Lord may have some hidden reason
for your actions...
   What is the matter? Are we not going
to form a contract?
 So you ignore His messenger... I admire
your bravery, but it will not gain you
any clemency!

  I shall mend your twisted mind for
your own sake!
  Where did you learn to speak such filth?
 I am an angel; His own messenger...
I do not yield to threats.
 As one of His messengers, you must attend
to me with respect.
It was correct after all to have banished
humans from paradise!
Is it given unto me that I must guide
such a fool...?
What a dangerous human... No, I...
I am without fear... you know...
With His protection, I fear nothing.
Thus, I am not afraid... You see...?
Is that a cry from your soul...?
What a pleasant human...
  What a pleasant human. Truly, you are
interesting indeed...
  If you wish to draw my attention, you
need only praise Him on high with your
hand to heart.
What a surprise! I had not known there
were humans capable of using magic!
   If humans, banished from paradise, can
use magic... this is rather inconvenient.
   Your skill is the equivalent to angelic
works... I do not mind as long as it does
not affect me, but...
  Tell me, can you produce any object you
choose from there? How wonderful!
Do not misunderstand... It is not that
I want something...
  Your power is a blessing from the heavens.
Use it not for your own sake, but for the
sake of those who have strayed.
 Your stories are a great help in learning
the state of affairs in the human world.
 A method of negotiation using stories...
It seems that you truly wish to draw
my attention.
I will gladly hear your story, but I wish
for you to make an offering before you
do so.
   There was no worth in your story...
I am sure that He is angry as well.
Now repent your sins!
 *sigh* I cannot continue listening to
such rubbish!
You should speak of more meaningful
things... Such as your offerings to us!
   If all humans can tell only such foolish
tales...
Then perhaps it was a mistake to allow
them to be redeemed.
 I believe there are others better suited
than I to tell that story to...
   It has been some time since I came to
the human world and heard such a
pleasant tale.
  Your words have a certain poetry to them.
Thanks to that, I enjoyed your speech.
   It is rare to find one with your talent
for speaking. Let us thank Him for our
meeting today.
 I understand your meaning. By all means,
continue with the negotiation.
How could I possibly neglect one who
is suffering!?
My powers will naturally be bestowed on
those who do good works! Now, please
make an offering.
You take too much for granted. If you
think what you want can be that easily
obtained, you are gravely mistaken!
   Have you forgotten how to make an effort?
Do not allow yourself to become dissolute!
   I refuse.
  If all humans think they can obtain
power so easily...
Perhaps it was a mistake to allow them
to be redeemed.
 O son of man... When did you become
so corrupt...?
 I am by no means a demon that will lend
you my power...
Cherish that feeling.
  If you heighten your faith in the Lord,
this negotiation will be successful.
   It is good to trust in my powers,
which are after all derived from Him.
I see the light of wisdom in your eyes.
Thus, your unbelievable actions just now
must have been to some purpose.
   Poor human, unable to grasp my existence...
Study His teachings.
   Act as though you are making fun of one
of His messengers, and you ensure your
own damnation...
But then too, even in Hell, money has
a powerful sway. This is not the infernal
abyss, but you should make an offering.
  How dare you make light of one of His
messengers! Know your place!
 Wicked humans who ridicule Him must
be corrected!
  As humans accumulate useless things
besides faith and order, they become
arrogant...
They must let go of what is unnecessary
in life... You should make an offering!
 O son of man... When did you become so
foolish as to ridicule the Lord...?
 H-How deplorable, being ridiculed by a
human... So this is the extent of
His power...
  I cannot believe you would mock one of
His messengers... Are you, perchance,
a demon child...?
Regardless, my work does not change.
Now, make an offering...
 Humans are blessed with free will!
Negotiate with me as you please!
Do you challenge me in combat? That is
much like a babe rising up against
an adult...
  Hah... Ah, excuse me. Please go on...
  Ah, you are a street performer.
Well, good luck to you.
Listen well... training is required in
all things. If you persist, you will
someday become proficient.
 I will grant my advice in return for an
offering. It is worth that much.
  That has no value at all.
  How vulgar! This is sufficiently
appalling to make me feel faint!
  I have wasted valuable time! You must
make amends for what you have done!
 I cannot understand humans who have
strayed from order!
Am I to understand... that was an evil
ritual of black magic!?
 I assume humans would wear an expression
of joy in times like these.
   These tricks would be effective if one
thinks of them as a form of training.
   So the humans banished from paradise do
at least have one redeeming feature...
 What do you mean to say to me, one of
His messengers?
  I understand your desire to draw my
attention, and therefore also His.
Now make an offering.
  So you yearn for His intervention...
An offering will be necessary.
   What is the meaning of this!? Regardless,
you must make an offering!
  I will not be tempted!
 Are your actions truly worthy of one
claiming to be a hero?
Should others find out about this, your
reputation will suffer.
  Wh-What do you want!? This is disgusting...
Th-That would be a sin... Get thee
behind me!
  Wh-What do you want!? You would try to
force me to go against His will...?
I-I'm being corrupted...
Ahaha... That was not bad. Now the time
has come for you to make an offering.
 How charming! You have definite charisma.
It is a truly wondrous thing!
It is very good that you hold an interest
in us...
 You, too, must be rather skilled. It is
not necessary to guess at my feelings
to maintain order.
   Ahaha... There is no use in trying to
put me off my guard.
 Have you forgotten already that such
thinking caused your exile from paradise!?
There is no need for humility if you
have done nothing wrong. Now atone for
your sins!
There is no need to fear me if you
have done nothing wrong. Now atone for
your sins!
  How suspicious... What are you scheming?
   Your sweet words mask a serpent's
poison... You frighten me...
 You understand that humans can never
reach the level of the almighty!
  Be afraid, and regret your sins!
   You are rather intelligent for a human
banished from paradise!
 That spell card... You have already
received the blessing of one of our
number...
Please make it into a Persona filled with
love, in keeping with His will.
   Then I will grant you this.
Oh? Is that so?
It is regrettable that you and I
differ in our fundamental beliefs...
  Hm... I cannot give you my card.
If you desire my protection, you must
make of yourself a shining example!
 You may take this, at least...
 If He wills it, we shall meet again
someday.
   I shall give you this as well.
 There are others who need my help!
Be truthful... do you really need me?
   Then I will give you my spell card as
proof of our contract.
I am ever watching you, so do not use
my spell card for evil...
  I will give you this, so...
If I continue talking with you, I will
become corrupt as well!
 If you desire a long life, take this
and leave. Put this matter behind you.
I cannot forgive you... but if we were
to do battle, I would be injured as
well... That would not be ideal.
O Lord! What does He wish of me!?
I will allow this to run its course...!
  Then I must thank you for giving me
a chance to face an ordeal... What would
you like?
 Ah, I have an idea. I shall protect you.
I will give you my card; please accept it!
I cannot take actions equivalent to
harming you!
   Please take this.
  However! I have an important mission
that must be accomplished!
...Those are the circumstances under
which I will give you my spell card.
Let us settle this peacefully...
 I will ask in His stead: For what purpose
do you exist?
  Is that the latest trend in garments?
I would be unable to wear it.
Our meeting here must be destiny...
Please make an offering.
  I will warn you in His stead: you shall
not obstruct my path!
I will warn you in His stead: an insult
to me will not be easily forgiven!
 So you are the one who has been pillaging
treasure from demons! Return them to
the Lord!
  I will warn you in His stead: do not
come near me!
   I am always watched over by the heavens!
There is n-nothing I f-fear...
Wicked one... Try though you might, you
cannot deceive me...
   It has been some time since I met one
capable of such orderly negotiation.
Please tell me your story!
I will confess to you... An angel's lot
is not an easy one. Do you see?
A full moon... On a day such as this,
it may be a way to entrust myself to you.
We are very busy. You must have important
business indeed to stop us, yes?
  You are rather suspicious... It may be
necessary to keep watch over you.
  You constantly perform wicked acts,
don't you? Now you will atone for
those sins!
N-Normally, I would not have time to hear
your words, but this once... I will make
an exception.
I accept your terms, but never forget
that He is with me.
 I called to you because He wished it.
But... I feel that my spell card would
be of limited use to you...
  Our encounter here today... Is it His
will that I lend you my strength?
 First, I must thank Him for being able
to meet you...
 Will I be of use to you? I am certain
that I will!
Minions of the ancient serpent!
Y-You will go no further!
   To encounter such wicked ones here...
O Lord! I place my life in Your hands!
  If you are not in league with the
Fallen One, then I would have you
make an offering...
  I will warn you in His stead: whatever
excuse you make, you will not deceive
these eyes!
I called to you because He wished it.
Regrettably, I fear you will not be able
to understand my words...
 I am <Name>!
Well? You must be inclined to give an
offering now.
  Ah... You have no plans to... torture me
or the like, do you...?
O Lord... Am I committing a mortal sin?
I can scarcely believe how my heart leapt
to imagine the cold treatment that I will
soon face...
 I confess... I... I was wrong.
Please punish me...
I see... I can understand it from your
point of view. Then what do you want
of me?
 As I thought... You must be fundamentally
corrected!
   How dreadful... Is it my fate to die
before I accomplish my mission...?
I was able to spend my time meaningfully.
I thank Him for the chance to meet you!
  I have an important task. If there is
something you desire, be quick and tell
me what it is!
   ...I understand. I will listen to your
words... Only calm your heart.
  It must be His will that I hear your
words... Now please tell me.
  O Lord... I have been corrupted.
No! You are wicked! Urgh... Get thee
behind me, tempter!
  Even I do not believe that everyone can
be saved! And in addition, you have
foolishly rejected His salvation!
  *gasp* If my delight is so intense...
I must have failed...
I have succumbed to your wicked charms...
Was this a test from Him?
   The love of money is the root of all evil!
I will look after <Amount> yen for you!
You have done a good thing. I am certain
that His blessings will be with you...
So you have none... If that is the case,
it is quite all right.
How dare you boast falsely of your own
wealth!? Suffer His wrath!
  How could this be!? Do you intend
to sell your immortal soul to the
ones below!?
   I cannot believe you would defy His
will... The extent of your blasphemy
is almost miraculous...
   Then I will take one life stone...
 Continue to do good works.
 You... have none? You are not hiding
them from me, are you...?
 How dare you boast falsely of your own
wealth!? Suffer His wrath!
  Poor thing... Your actions just now may
have ensured your eternal damnation.
   I cannot believe you would defy His
will... The extent of your blasphemy
is almost miraculous...
   You carry a , do you not?
You should give it to me.
   I am astounded by your inner beauty!
   If you had none, you should have said
as much from the start...
I weep for your attachment to worldly
things.
  It seems that you have very little awe
of Him... There is no doubt that
judgement will be brought down upon you!
   That fresh, youthful, vital energy you
have about you... That is what I desire.
Thank you. You have been most generous.
Well, I am sure you have your reasons.
It is all right. Do not let it get to you.
  This is your opportunity to devote
yourself to His cause! I am sure that
judgement will be brought down upon you!
  There is no need to be modest.
 I think... that you would seem more
refined if you said nothing.
   You are a rare breed of human to have
overcome the ordeal He presented.
Lies hurt the liar as well!
You stand before Him and yet lie...?
How dreadful...
   An honest apology is important as well.
I am sure His blessing will be with you!
   You are wise.
  So you will follow His teachings? My time
as a messenger was well-spent if I was
able to meet a human as wise as you.
  Very well, but... you are not going
to borrow the power of demons instead,
I hope.
Listen well: demons cannot be trusted!
...Well then, please make an offering...
   Hm... very well, then.
 Perhaps I misheard, but did you just
threaten to do something cruel to me?
You did...! Me, of all creatures!
   Perhaps I misheard, but did you just
threaten to do something cruel to me?
You are a wicked one...
 Ahaha... If you speak such things,
you will become a target for the
demons, you know...
If you speak such things, you will be
a target for the demons, you know...
 Surely that is the work of demons!
Tell me, did your schoolteacher have
a tail...?
 You see? If you try, you can do it too!
Such rudeness towards me, one of His
messengers... I can scarcely believe
that you are a son of man...
 Do not underestimate an angel!
 There is no need to be modest.
 I think... that you would seem more
refined if you said nothing.
   You are a rare breed of human to have
overcome the ordeal He presented.
Lies hurt the liar as well!
You stand before Him and yet lie...?
How dreadful...
   An honest apology is important as well.
I am sure His blessing will be with you!
   Unfortunately... this is not a game!
   You will not escape after this! Now draw
your weapon!
  Whew... Good heavens, did you never take
music lessons!?
   Whew... That was a near thing... My wings
were about to be jarred loose.
   I let my guard down... I had not expected
another form of assault...!
  I can only say that was marvelous!
I was not aware humans like you still
existed in this world!
I feel as though I am under your sway...
   There is no need to be modest.
 I think... that you would seem more
refined if you said nothing.
   You are a rare breed of human to have
overcome the ordeal He presented.
Lies hurt the liar as well!

  Very well, but... you are not going

I hope.
Listen well: demons cannot be trusted!
...Well then, please make an offering...
   I can scarcely believe you continue to
lie before one of His messengers! There
will be no clemency for you!
Did I err...? No, I cannot have...
 So, you show your true nature!
 Is that so? Then I shall continue to
try my hardest!
   If you are going to be so blunt, even an
angel will recall what anger feels like.
  I understand, but... it is rather
disheartening to hear you say it
so bluntly...
   But why? That was what drove your
earlier actions!
 You have made great strides in coming to
understand that, have you not? Then keep
trying your hardest!
 There is no need to be modest.
 I think... that you would seem more
refined if you said nothing.
   You are a rare breed of human to have
overcome the ordeal He presented.
Lies hurt the liar as well!

Listen well: demons cannot be trusted!
...Well then, please make an offering...
   Haha, please excuse me. That was indeed
very rude of me.
   Why are you ashamed? Knowing one's true
strengths is a very ordinary thing!
Speaking with you brings me peace
of mind!
 I can scarcely believe you continue to
lie before one of His messengers! There
will be no clemency for you!
Did I err...? No, I cannot have...
 So, you show your true nature!
 Is that so? Then I shall continue to
try my hardest!
   If you are going to be so blunt, even an

  I understand, but... it is rather
disheartening to hear you say it
so bluntly...
   There are many forms of love, but not all
are genuine. However, His love suffuses
all, and...
> The speech goes on and on.
Did you not want to talk? What a fickle
creature you are!
  I will forgive you this time.
  You must not flee simply because my words
are painful to you!
  Whew... In truth, that surprised me.
   At this rate, I shall become fallen...
 You are right. Courage is necessary
at times.
  It is... not given to me to act rashly...
  This is my personal problem. It is not
a matter for humans.
So that is why! Your actions are
deceptively profound.
 You fail to understand indirect methods
of expressions!
That is more interesting than what you
tried a moment ago.
 Ah, is that so? But that is something
one would normally say to a female human.
A-Are you quite well...?
   It would be best to offer all your
proceeds to the Lord.
   That is unfortunate.
   I would definitely like to hear it.
If that is your attitude, so be it!

There is a limit to how much I will
take from a human!
  This is not for my personal interest,
but rather my duty...
Can you not hear my words!?
Humans have not changed. They are as
childish as ever...
   How childish can you be!?
  Ahaha... all of our actions have a
profound meaning behind them.
   We who are His messengers do not lie!
Do not insult me so!
 ...How did you find out?
   You should have no secret from one of
His messengers!
  What a troublesome human... The Lord
watches over you, even if you do not
carry out such bizarre acts.
 So that is why...
  I refer to you! You!
   You are right. Even a lowly human such
as you has pride.
   Ah... so you, too, have your pride...
  Do you see now that it is all right?
   Ah... I hope that your fear was not
too great...
   Those who show kindness will receive
their rewards. Do not forget that.
Listen well: you are being tested.
Are you truly confident in your choice?
 I meant that I wanted something else...
Can you not deduce even that!?
 You are a quick thinker. Very well then,
I shall take you up on it.
   May His blessing be with you...
*gasp* So it was a trap! Deceiving an
angel is an act of blasphemy towards Him!
*gasp* So it was a trap...
 There is no need to be modest.
 I think... that you would seem more
refined if you said nothing.
   You are a rare breed of human to have

Such rudeness towards me, one of His
messengers... I can scarcely believe

 Do not underestimate an angel!
 You are rash, yet surprisingly honest.
 You are without hope if you cannot even
understand the kindness of others!
 It seems my very existence was too much
for you. I never imagined it would cause
you to regress to infanthood...
   Answer succinctly and clearly!
 Were my words too difficult to understand?
 But your words are not worth reprimanding!
 That is correct... Perhaps from your
point of view, that is the case...
I am still in training. Withstanding
insults is also part of my ordeal.
I may not look it, but I am very
familiar with modern youth's music!
   I only wanted a little, you see...
 Ahaha... It was a mere jest.
   Hm? Ah, please excuse me. I did not
understand that you were dancing...
Your endurance is impressive for a
human. My opinion of you has improved
considerably.
 *sigh* I am weary... I had underestimated
you humans...
Is that the extent of your passion!?
   Hm... very well, then.
 Perhaps I misheard, but did you just
say that you intend to defeat me?
You did...! Me, of all creatures!
   Did you just say that you intend to
defeat me? You are a wicked one...
 Ahaha... If you speak such things,
you will become a target for the
demons, you know...

Such rudeness towards me, one of His
messengers... I can scarcely believe
that you are a son of man...
 Do not underestimate an angel!
 I was merely jesting! You seem somewhat
naive...
   *gasp* Do you mean to say you truly are
trying to open it...? Stop this madness
at once, I beg you!
*gasp* Do you mean to say you truly are
trying to open it...?
  Is that so? In any event, thank you.
   You know that I am a <Name>, yes?
   You are quite rude! In any event, it is
folly to negotiate with someone whom you
know nothing about!
   Ahaha... Is that so?
   You have a very short temper! Our Lord
weeps to see that you cannot take a joke!
   I am sorry. My jest went too far.
  There is no need to be modest.
 I think... that you would seem more
refined if you said nothing.
   You are a rare breed of human to have
overcome the ordeal He presented.
Lies hurt the liar as well!

  Very well, but... you are not going

I hope.
Listen well: demons cannot be trusted!
...Well then, please make an offering...
   What folly!
So that is why! I must say, though,
that is a bizarre commandment.
 Ah, so that is why! You should continue
your training as well.
 Whew... I am saved...
  You should refrain from doing things
that others would not like!
   Next time, I shall teach you that
nothing can scare me while I am under
His protection.
I am sorry. But first, you must make
an offering.
 Keeping secrets is the first step on
the road to depravity!
It is true!
I was only teasing you! It is unthinkable
for me to be swayed by a human's song!
   ...I am glad I remained unswayed.
  Unfortunately... this is not a game!
   You will not escape after this! Now draw
your weapon!
  I can only say that was marvelous!
I was not aware humans like you still
existed in this world!
I feel as though I am under your sway...
   Ahaha... Angels do not age!
You were making sport of me,
were you not...?
  ...Did you just mock an angel? Blasphemer!
Defier of His will!
 Then that was on purpose...? O Lord!
A deceiver stands before me!
  All is well. I will guide you to the
correct path. First, make an offering.
   Hmm... I have no answer ready.
 Ahaha... Whichever it may be, I am
afraid I do not know.
   There is no need to be modest.
 I think... that you would seem more
refined if you said nothing.
   You are a rare breed of human to have
overcome the ordeal He presented.

 Then that was on purpose...? O Lord!
A deceiver stands before me!
  All is well. I will guide you to the
correct path. First, make an offering.
   ...You do not understand at all...
 What are you saying!? It is you that
I am concerned about!
 There are many forms of love, but not all
are genuine. However, His love suffuses
all, and...
> The speech goes on and on.
Did you not want to talk? What a fickle
creature you are!
  Hm... Atone for your sins and I will
forgive you this time.
   You must not flee simply because my words
are painful to you!
  ...In the end, I cannot do it!
 Why is the whisper of evil so sweet...!?
   Do your utmost! I will aid you in getting
through it!
  Ordeals are meant to be trying! If you
yield now, you are not even worth
a reprimand!
  This is an ordeal. Though... if you make
an offering, I am sure your suffering
will be lessened somewhat.
 Hm? That was true? P-Please forgive me
for doubting you...
 Is it not so? Well, it is your own fault
for looking so suspicious!
It is I who wants to cry, you realize...
*sniffle*
 That is correct! The Lord helps those
who help themselves!
 Those were false tears, then? How dare
you deceive one of His messengers...
This, I do not forgive!
Hm... very well, then.
 Did you just threaten to do something
to me? You did...! Me, of all creatures!
 Did you just threaten to do something
to me? You are a wicked one...
   Ahaha... If you speak such things,
you will become a target for the

  All is well. I will guide you to the
correct path. First, make an offering.
   That is a rather cruel way to treat
someone who has done nothing!
  I cannot claim to understand, but if I
have offended you, I apologize...
   Your harsh words sear away even what
little uncleanliness I possess.
   What is the matter? Please do go on!
   There is no need to be ashamed.
I think... that you would seem more
refined if you said nothing.
   You are a rare breed of human to have
overcome the ordeal He presented.

   You are a rather shy one.
  Forming such shallow plans is a waste
of time! Humans truly are disgraceful!
   In your heart, you wished to talk, no?
There is no need to pretend otherwise.
  You felt His wrath and yet remain
defiant... You have sold your soul
to the ones below, haven't you?
   There is nothing left of your soul
to be saved...
  This is how you are meant to be!
   Ah, so you are in the midst of training!
   Ah... I am of the order of <Name>,
you know...
  Why would you take that tone with me!?
 You are a rather shy one.

 I do not jest!
 Such rudeness towards me, one of His
messengers... I can scarcely believe
that you are a son of man...
 It is your fault! Yours!
   You are right. Even a lowly human such
as you has pride.
   Ah... So you, too, have your pride...
  Do you see now that it is all right?
   Oh dear... did you see through it...?
  Things that go beyond moderation rapidly
become unpleasant.
A-Actually... Please don't...!
 You are a rather elusive one.
  Mmm... I suppose so.
   What? Is this true!?
   How could you!? You can be nothing but
a villain who preys on the innocent!
H-How could you...?
I thought as much. I only wanted to
confirm it with you. Now, let us move
on to an offering, shall we...?
 I am relieved.
 Do you intend to use that for your own
personal gain? I warn you...!
   We are not demons, you realize...
  Ahaha... Your intentions are good, I see.
That is, if what you say is true...
  Your intentions are good. I am sure that
He is pleased.
Oh, my! Are you striving to improve the
environment? How commendable!
  That is how it should be.
  Can you not see that if you walk alongside
another on the road, you will only get in
the way of others!?
   I see! If that is the case, perhaps I can
permit it.
   Ah... You thought this through,
didn't you?
I-I warned you not to come near...
D-Did you not hear me...?
   Listen well... The noble of heart do
nothing suspicious.
   To mock me is to mock Him! It seems to
me that you require punishment!
 Ha... haha...
  Are you demanding a tithe from an angel!?
I take back what I said earlier!
 You are either a master negotiator,
or stingy enough to demand a tithe
from an angel...
Then I shall ascertain your true strength.
 Come now, do not say such things...
So you do have business with me... But it
had best be important, or I shall not
find forgiveness for you.
  My time is better spent dealing with
things besides humans like you!
   I told you that I have no time to spare
you! I regret to say that a human like
you is beyond salvation!
That is unfortunate... I fear that it
may have been important. Please try and
remember what it was.
Alas! How impudent can humans be?
  Oh, my... Is that so? How unfortunate.
 I-I am sorry...!
   So you are an optimist... if this is the
work of the ones below, pretending to
carry out His will...
   Then let us thank Him for this meeting!
That is unfortunate...
 You are right. That was not a question
normal humans should be asked.
  Th-That would be difficult... Ah, I mean,
you shall go no further...
   Ah! So you are frightened by the visage
of a <Name>!
Ugh... I grow nauseated even to hear that
name! You should not ask such things!
Ahaha... It is not right to make sport
of we angels.
   Ah... did I err? Then you should make
an offering.
It is deplorable to continue these lies
after all this! Be ashamed!
Dear me... I feel as though my face is
becoming red...
 But your behavior compels me...
Whew... thank Heaven. Then please,
make an offering.
  Dear me... What should I do...?
Dear me... What should I do...?
It's not that great.
   It's been hard for me.
 It's been hard for me.
 It's true.
