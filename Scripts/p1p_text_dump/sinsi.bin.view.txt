suspicious as to whether or not you
comprehend its meaning.
   So, what merits are there to listening
to you speak?
 Such senseless chit-chat... I would
rather you refrained from mocking me!
  Another lie... I can already imagine
your undignified lifestyle.
 Haha, those eyes of yours... It's all
just a pretext to talk with me, no?
  So you understand how much power is
flowing through my superior body?
Hmm... Well, well. Sounds like we
should spar.
 Are you using those barbaric negotiation
tactics in hopes that I'll listen?
  If you can cross even me, you are really
rather hopeless!
  The changing seasons always bring these
types around. It's so troubling...
   It would be easiest were I to just
crush you... But I will stay my hand a
bit longer...
If you kill a demon who puts up no
resistance, your reputation will suffer.

 I will not become anyone's slave...
I am my own self...
How many of my compatriots have lost
their lives, taken in by those clever
words? I am not a fool...
 That unsophisticated song is nothing
short of disturbing... Stop at once!
  You thought to gain my interest with
such an amateur voice!? How absurd!
I recommend voice lessons!
  Your poverty... It is too horrible...
I can scarcely believe it...
 Is your strategy to destroy my ears...?
Ugh... How cowardly...
   Hmmm... Hmmmmmm... Yes, I like it!
Keep it up!
 What a superb song! You must be loved
by the muses!
  It seems logical, but I'm rather
suspicious as to whether or not you

I am not one to be fooled by the shallow
wit of humans! I would prefer that you
not underestimate me!
  It seems I expected too much of you...
I did not assume you were so wretched!
What are you planning...? Surely you
wouldn't do something like that without
thinking it through...
I've heard you are one who is feared
and respected by other demons...
Hahahaha, unfortunately, the calvary
isn't coming.
 You have no need to fear. I just wanted
to converse with you...
See how kind I am? Although, this always
leads to trouble... I end up gaining an
even larger human fanbase...
   It seems logical, but I'm rather
suspicious as to whether or not you

Excuse me! There is no need for this

   You have no need to fear me. I only
punish those who forget their place...

   I cannot believe you, yet... nor can I
bring myself to hate you. A mystery...
  Perhaps this will open a door to a new
world...
  No matter how I look at it, you are
still a man!
   I have no interest in this! I prefer
an elegant, fair maiden!
I should have worn my silk pants...
I... I am a male. Please, do not make
such jokes...
  This is quite delightful! It seems my
charm is not bound by gender.
I am pleased, but this is unfamiliar
ground for me... What am I supposed to
do?
  That's a childish idea. But I understand
the need for attention.
   You! Are you already associated with a
talent agency? You truly have an
excellent sense of humor!
  ...What rubbish!
   I struggle to understand... Can you
explain the point of your statement in
an essay of Ⴤ00 words or less?
Hmmm? I have goosebumps...
 Perhaps that would serve you better as...
something else... Yes, quite right!
It doesn't work as a joke...
   In my humble opinion, your face is many
times more funny than that joke!
   You have an excellent sense of humor!
Perhaps a singing or TV career is in
your near future!
 Humans can be quite amusing. I envy you
for being able to talk like that.
  Are those the rumors that circulate
among the humans?
How vulgar! Don't you have anything
better to do with your time!?
  What a boring subject! It would be more
interesting if my rumors spread!
 Conversations like this are good for me
every so often. I'm always so tense...
 If that is what this is about, it's
quite cute. Take me for example. The
secrets I know are universe-bending.
That's a childish idea. But I understand
the need for attention.
   You may have a point, but allow me to
ask... What was it?
How unsightly...!
  Gentle as I am, even I am moved to anger
sometimes!
  Did I hurt your feelings? I'm sorry, but
your logic is rather flawed. That's not
good...
   Calm down, young man... You are taking
this too far...
   You've come all this way to do business?
You are a hard worker.
If you were willing to give me
something, I would not refuse it!
Is there anything you've forgotten?
 Negotiating with demons for your own
benefit!? You may as well be a merchant
of death! How horrible!
   Do you think the entire world can be
moved with dirty money and power?
   Now I have a souvenir to bring home.
Thank you!
I receive many gifts from many women,
but this is the first time I've received
one from a man.
   It seems logical, but I'm rather
suspicious as to whether or not you

  I would not be a gentleman if I raised
my eyebrows at everything a child says.
 If you cannot provide a satisfactory
greeting, you'll have trouble later in
life.
I happen to be a master of etiquette.
Would you like some lessons?
I'd rather not involve myself with a
twisted human like you!
   Hmph, a gentleman only by appearance!
You humans will be the death of the
term!
  It is somewhat embarrassing to receive
so much praise...
   You know a lot for a human! You are
truly intelligent.
   How unfortunate... Were you a beautiful
woman, I would ask you for a dance,
but... ahh, how unfortunate.
   You are quite skilled! Is that one of
the dances young people enjoy nowadays?
Why don't you stop worrying about how
you look and focus on the basics!
It's time to stop your foolishness!
You'll hurt yourself spasming like that!
 Haha! Brings back memories of the last
ball I attended!
Excellent poise! Shall we dance the
night away?
  Hmm... Well, well. Sounds like we
should spar.

  I know my face is beautiful, but what
would you do if you bored a hole right
through it? You're a troubling one...
 How troubling... I welcome the
passionate gaze of a woman, but this...
   It is rude to stare at a stranger like
that!
   You look at me as though I've stolen
your love or something of the sort!
 If you are entranced by my face, then
gaze upon it as you will!
I did not imagine you preferred men!
I figured there was a girl somewhere
in your heart...
   It seems logical, but I'm rather
suspicious as to whether or not you
comprehend its meaning.
   So, what merits are there to listening

We seek identity through the words of
ghosts... What they said carries more
weight than any modern tongue.
 How boring! I'll show you something
much scarier than that...
Uwah! ...I-It's nothing...I just
thought something touched me...
   I-I don't have time to listen to such
frivilous stories...
   Hmm... You enjoy stories of that sort?
I find that becoming of a girl.
 You are easily scared, and yet you still
enjoy stories like that!?
You've piqued my curiosity. Tell me why
this is.
 Hm, quite beautiful. Surely, your voice
matches your face.
 I see... Now is the voice good, or
merely the song?
  That unsophisticated song is nothing
short of disturbing... Stop at once!
  You thought to gain my interest with
such an amateur voice!? How absurd!
I recommend voice lessons!
  Hmmm... Hmmmmmm... Yes, I like it!
Keep it up!
 What a superb song! You must be loved
by the muses!
  Do you perhaps... have children already?
Ah, pardon me. I should not be so
forward with a lady.
   Hahaha! Despite my boyish face, I am
anything but a child.
   I will make you regret taking that tone
with me... for the rest of eternity
from hell!
 You are surprisingly rude! Were you
raised correctly?
Hm, I can sense your kindness. You will
make a good mother.
Hmm... That's nice. I feel relaxed...
It seems logical, but I'm rather
suspicious as to whether or not you
comprehend its meaning.
   So, what merits are there to listening

longer!
 Y-You piece of--! Oh my, excuse me...
I cannot believe you, yet... nor can I
bring myself to hate you. A mystery...
  Perhaps this will open a door to a new
world...
  If it's your plan to seduce me, you may
want to try again in ten years!
You willingly step forward to be
my prey? I am not interested in fools!
  If you insist, I would be happy to!
I must say, women these days have no
sense of shame... Although... it works
to my advantage!
 That brings a tear to my eye...
Your hard work will be rewarded one day.
   Your tear-stained face is cute, but I'm
sure your smile is many times more
beautiful... Wipe your tears, child.
  What proof do I have that those tears
are real!? Your plan is to trick me,
isn't it!?
  Women have cried a thousand tears, and
I have been taken by each one of them!
Am I too good at heart...?
 M-Miss...? Is something the matter...?
 Wh-What is wrong? I don't think this is
a very fitting place to cry...
   Hmm... Well, well. Sounds like we
should spar.

This is so sudden... Odd, I don't
recall doing anything wrong...
   If I've done you any wrong, I apologize
for it... I beg your forgiveness...
  When I was a child, there was something
I too, could not forgive...
But I have thrown that memory into
oblivion, and it no longer upsets me.
  Ahhh! I feel so humiliated... But...
Please! Would you be so kind as to
torment me more...!?
 It seems logical, but I'm rather
suspicious as to whether or not you
comprehend its meaning.

 How surprising! You don't see a reaction
like that every day!
  I thought you had business with me...
Have I misunderstood?
  I admire your courage, but, you are too
bold! In other words, you are being
impertinent!
   To a demon, that is most insolent!
Is this considered proper manners to
you humans?
  I have no recollection of doing so,
but... it seems I have angered you...
  ......I am a gentleman, therefore I must
remain gentle. ...That was a joke...

   You may have a point, but allow me to
ask... What was it?
Did I hurt your feelings? I'm sorry, but
your logic is rather flawed. That's not
good...
   Calm down, young man... You are taking
this too far...
   I cannot believe you, yet... nor can I
bring myself to hate you. A mystery...
  Hahaha, I will consider that an overly
expressive show of your emotions.
   That's a childish idea. But I understand
the need for attention.
   Hmmm... Now THIS is entertainment!
   Such uncanny trickery... You may be a
much stronger opponent than I first
imagined...
  Using such uncanny trickery... How
alarming! You are far too dangerous!
  Ah, thank goodness! If you can continue
to make such things appear, perhaps we
could ride out this depression.
 What superb magic! I won't be able to
sleep if I don't know its mechanisms,
so I do hope you'll tell me!
 No matter the subject, I will learn
something new, correct?
From here on, be a good conversation
partner with me!
 Hahaha, I admit, I'm quite interested
in what humans have to say.
  Are you saying you'd like me to be the
listener? Well, my reply depends on
the weight of your reward.
 You talk too much of meaningless things!
Learn moderation!
 I grow weary of these boring talks.
Let us end this!
   Oh, be quiet! You needn't speak, only
listen!
 I have no time at the moment...
But perhaps next time...
   It has nothing to do with me...
Hahaha, quite an amusing subject.
  Many of my acquaintances are getting on
in years... I've actually been looking
for someone like you to speak with.
 Hahaha, you say such amusing things.
   Both of us stand to benefit... I will
lend you my power if I feel so
inclined...
   I won't answer immediately, but...
I don't think it's a bad deal.
  In other words, you would like me to
spare my time for you. My answer will
depend on your appreciation's weight.
  Were you never taught the rules of how
common folk greet nobility!?
I am shocked that you would think I'd
lend you my power after such boring
negotiation techniques!
  Talk is cheap. I want to know how
strong your resolution is...
These are words of humans... You must be
up to something...
I am busy, but... I cannot fathom what
you would do if I refused...
I refuse... My power does not exist for
the sake of humans...
  Hahaha, even when I'm not dressed up,
I'm the center of attention.
 Hahaha... You are pure, so listen
carefully: You must use your negotiation
techniques appropriately.
   That makes me quite happy. I don't
mind lending you my power, but let me
tantalize you a little further...
 So you plan on taking the reigns of
this negotiation? Ha... Very well.
 It's quite childish of you to use such
techniques... I suggest you mature.
 You've dealt quite a blow to my mental
state... I request compensation.
   I'm sorry, but it would jeopardize my
reputation if I were to offer a
retort to your taunt.
You thought I would lose my cool over
this? How incorrect you were!
I see you require corrections to your
attitude in a most Spartan way!
Lesson one! Present me with a gift!
The first indication that one does not
know manners is in their speech...
  I am a demon... Unless you are as well,
you should be afraid...
What are you saying!? Ah... Ahhhh...!
O-Oh, please excuse me...
It's best that you get things like that
out of your system while you're young!
That being said, I will tolerate it!
Hahaha, the things humans do never
really change, do they?
 It's not that I mind your attitude...
But it doesn't exactly inspire my
interest, either. You understand,
don't you?
 Your performance was rough around
the edges, but there could be a diamond
in there.
You're practicing your performance here?
Ah, well I have heard that if you skip
a day, it takes three to regain it.
I would pay money to see a wonderful
performance, but that... wasn't.
Thus, the reverse should apply.
 How absurd... Cut it out!
  Enough of this! I have no business with
such amateur performers!
   I have no need of entertainment!
Why don't you give me something useful?
  What do you think? If a stranger started
singing and dancing in front of you,
wouldn't you be somewhat disturbed...?
   Have you recently hit your head...?
Are you... alright?
You must not have a care in the
world... I envy you.
   Haha, I feel like I've wandered into
a play.
   Hahaha! That is good! I could use a
stiff drink!
   Honestly, this makes me happy. You are
quite a charmer.
If this is a dream, then... Hmmm...
What to do...?
 That is quite enticing, but I think I'd
like a little extra.
  Will you stop mocking me!?
 Was that an attempt to win me over?
I must say, it was not very proper!
You plan to tempt me over to you, is
that it? If so, it's not going to work!
  You never know what humans like you will
do if you don't play along...
 I may be beautiful, but to accept such
an invitation... I have a reputation...
 I already have plans. Maybe next time...
   That is wonderful!
 Hahaha, what a pickle I'm in! I cannot
simply decline your offer... Haha,
indeed, it's quite a predicament!
Hahaha! You have a cute side!
  Well, knowing how much stronger I am
than you... I cannot hold back.
   Hmmm... The rumors said you had more
spirit than you're showing me now...
  No matter how much time passes, you'll
never catch up to me! That's how it is!
 How unsightly! Please, knock it off!
   Then you will listen to whatever I say,
correct!?
 Why would you say that...? That's a
bit fishy...
   Wh-What are you trying to say? Let's
negotiate normally, shall we...?
  Exactly! I am as strong as I am
beautiful! Hahahahaha!
 Admit defeat! If you do, I'll spare
your life!
 Finally! I have come so far!
   Ahh, you already have my spell card!
Not bad!
  Then I shall give you this.
I see...
   It seems our values are irreconciably
different. We'd only be unhappy, so I
think we should break up...
A low-level demon would be more becoming
of such low-level humans. You understand
that, right?
 Then at least make use of this!
Then excuse me, if you will. I look
forward to meeting again.
  Here is a token of my gratitude.
   If you are done, I'll be on my way!
Then I will give you my spell card, as
you have requested. Make me a Persona
both gentle and firm.
 I shall give you this... so... er...
Please, just let me go!
   If I continue this conversation, my
level will drop as well!
   You want this? Very well, take it and
be gone!
 Still... a gentleman should never engage
in such pointless bloodshed... Hmmm...
What to do...
  Urgh, I can not bring myself to care
any less! Here is my spell card;
do what you will with it!
So, I'd like for you to have my spell
card!
Now! Take my spell card!
   So you see, I have no intention of
fighting you. I hold you in high esteem!
This isn't much, but it'd be an honor
if you'd take it!
I will give you my spell card... But
please do not concern yourself with me
again!
 Please, don't rip the spell card...
You answered my call... So allow me
to ask: what are your intentions?
So you answered my call... I am
conducting a study on humans, you see...
But, it's quite strange... I don't see
what reason you have for coming to such
a dangerous place...
  Ah, you've answered my call. I am
glad to meet you.
In any case, would you be so kind as to
provide some token by which I could
commemorate this occasion by?
For some reason, it irks me to simply
look upon your face. Why do you think
that is?
 A human has answered my call, and it is
a child, no less!
I would have rather it been a beautiful
woman!
  I am the guardian here! If you wish to
pass, you must pay the toll!
   Do you believe that everything you say
is automatically correct?
 Am I going to be killed by a human?
Of all the ways to die...
Hmm? Don't mind me, I was just thinking
aloud...
I am strong! A vision of perfection!
I cannot lose... to humans... or at
least... I don't think I can...
   I feel as though we've met before!
Do you have any idea where?
   You seem to have your own troubles.
Do not lose faith, and continue to
persevere.
  I feel good today! Were I a human,
I'd offer to go drinking with you!
  So it seems you've been busy tempting
demons, and killing them if they don't
comply... Are you an idler, or a fool?
 Have you grown weary of the mundane life
you lead? ...You must be ecstatic that
things have come to this!
 You desire company? Normally you would
pay for something like that, would you
not?
   It seems you are but children... Why do
you walk headfirst into danger? Are you
not afraid?
 Those eyes mean business... I fear that
if I do not oblige, I may be killed...
So you are a human! Oh, the horror!
And it was such a joyous stroll...
Regardless, I don't feel I could ever
be bored around you.
  Watching you, I feel something hot
building up inside of me...
Hmm... I'd like to get your contact
information for later.
Unlike animals, d-demons have no meat
on them... You couldn't eat me if you
tried, okay?
Allow me to set the record straight:
I've not killed any humans! Don't take
your revenge on the wrong demon!
  Of all things to run into, I encounter a
barbaric human... How am I so unlucky!?
  It is a human's fate to die with or
without a demon's help! You'd agree,
wouldn't you?
  In this world, there are meager humans
such as yourself, and great demons
such as I... Is that clear?
 It's only a matter of time before humans
are the domesticated pets of demons.
You exist to serve!
Ah, Master... I may call you that, yes?
 Compared to your greatness, I am but a
weak, ugly, filthy demon... and yet...
Thank you for answering my call.
   So you've answered my call...
No matter how much verbal or physical
abuse you have for me... As long as it
is from you, it is my pleasure!
   It seems you and I might do well
together.
Now, please tell me exactly what you
want.
 So you have finally managed to anger
me... You shall not leave here alive!
 Y-You stand to gain n-nothing from...
k-killing me... You are dangerous,
human...
  I am so glad to have met you! This is
one of the greatest moments in my
life!
  I won't allow you to waste any more of
my precious time! Now, tell me your
business!
   I will listen to you, but please, no
frightening or painful things!
You have all the qualifications of a
gentleman! Allow me to hear your
request.
 D-Don't come near me! I'm... I'm very
strong, you hear!?
   Speaking with you has made me hungry...
I must say, you look quite delicious!
  You deserve to reign over the demons as
king...! You will be our overlord!
 Then I shall have money.
ᄊ<Amount> shall do.
  Excellent answer.
  Ah, you are actually quite poor. Next
time, stop at the bank first!
You don't even have that much...? Well,
I have no business with poor vagrants.
 Why did you begin this conversation?
You don't have a very good attitude.
  Why did you begin this conversation?
I don't understand your attitude.
 Then I shall take a life stone. Just
one will be sufficient.
   Ah, how obedient!
  A good answer, but if you don't actually
have it...
You don't have a life stone!? This is
preposterous! A colossal waste of time!
  Is that so...? I suggest you put more
value on your life than on a stone!
  Is that so...? I suggest you put more
value on your life than on a stone!
  I ask for a  of you.
That is a gem worthy of me.
  I believe the gem would be more happy
with me than with you.
   Hmph... So my request was impossible
for you, was it?
  The gem is crying... I won't forgive you
for that!
 The fairy of the gem must be happy,
being so protected by you. I will
relent for now...
Then would you please share some of your
power with me? ...It'll be painless.
  Excuse me, then...
 Your power will sustain my flesh...
Nothing is more honorable than that,
and yet you...!
   Are you not feeling well? If you plan on
surviving in this world, you must attend
to your health.
  Is that so...? You can never trust the
words of a human, though.
   I'm nitpicky, you say!? Hahahaha!
What an answer! Hahahaha!
My question is nitpicky, you say!? Do
you realize a single mistake can lead to
a life or death situation!?
 You should consider who you are trying
to fool before you engage the trick.
I don't trust a word you say.
  I won't nod to every word out of your
mouth, but I may believe some of them.
   Right? There is nothing I do not know.
 Right!? You weak humans must be quite
jealous!
 How tragic! Are your eyes clouded!?
Allow me to polish them then!
  What...? To think there are humans who
cannot comprehend my body's beauty!
What is the world coming to...?
 Hahaha, you are like a child!
  Then would you be so kind as to tell me
what the meaning of this is!? Hmph,
there are no excuses!
  Is that so...? If that is the case,
then never mind.
   Haha, pardon me! It's just that your
actions lacked common sense!
  Hmph! Then watch what you do before you
get upset over what I tell you next
time!
  ...Oh my... It looks like you're the
real thing...
 You don't care what others think of
you...? Is... Is that so...? P-Please,
spare my life!
  You are quite understanding!
It seems we have good affinity.
   Correct, there is no need for pointless
bloodshed! I'm glad you are so wise.
   Is that so...? You can never trust the
words of a human, though.
   I'm nitpicky, you say!? Hahahaha!

  I won't nod to every word out of your

   Right? There is nothing I do not know.
 What...? You enjoy the loss of life?
I cannot fathom how anyone can't
understand its precious nature...
Oh... Please, spare me a moment!
I need time to think...
   It may not have been your intention,
but in the end, you tricked me! I cannot
forgive you for this!
Hahaha, I kid! An honest answer would
only put me on the spot. Hahahaha!
   Hahaha, it's just a joke! You must have
it hard, doing this and that to try and
get on a demon's good side.
What are you looking for? A warrior to
fight by your side? Or a circus
performer? Now isn't the time to sing!
  Huh? It was just such a horrible voice,
so... Er... Excuse me...
   A gentleman can never be defeated by
cowards! My rage is in full swing!

   Please, stop this! If I hear any more,
I may have reservations about killing
you!
  I do not approve of this arrogance!
You are a fool who has forgotten the
importance of knowing when to quit!
   That was wonderful... As long as I can
hear that voice sing, I don't need
anything else!
   Is that so...? You can never trust the
words of a human, though.
   I'm nitpicky, you say!? Hahahaha!
What an answer! Hahahaha!

 How tragic! Are your eyes clouded!?
Allow me to polish them then!
  What...? To think there are humans who
cannot comprehend my body's beauty!
What is the world coming to...?
 So you still have shame... So be it.
But be careful next time.
 I see. You mean to say that the ends
justify the means. ...I disagree!
 No? That is too bad. If it were true,
I would have considered helping you.
 I knew it! You fell for it, you demon
murderer! You won't be forgiven!
 Be more honest with yourself! I shall
send you a pamphlet for my fan club.
 What kind of desperate excuse is that!?
There's no emotion behind it!
  Is that so...? You can never trust the
words of a human, though.
   I'm nitpicky, you say!? Hahahaha!
What an answer! Hahahaha!

 Hahahaha! That was a falsification.
Stay alert next time!
  Wha-What!? You must be a kunoichi...
A professional in the art of seduction!
   So you still have shame... So be it.
But be careful next time.
 I see. You mean to say that the ends
justify the means. ...I disagree!
 Be more honest with yourself! I shall
send you a pamphlet for my fan club.
 What kind of desperate excuse is that!?
There's no emotion behind it!
  Is... Is that so... V-Very well... Ugh!
No! My body will not move...
   What do you have to fear now? Hahaha,
allow me!
You dare to quit after enticing me to
do so!? A gentleman never breaks his
word!
   R-Really!? Um... no dyed hair, got it!?
Oh, um, and I prefer a girl who looks
good in braids...
I am grateful. I will take your words
with a grain of salt.
This isn't about being picky or not!
Are you okay with that!?
  Ah, you understand!? Well when you are
reborn as a beauty beyond compare,
I will be counting on you!
   Hahahaha! Oh well... I shall yield to
your persistence.
I... I am still not ready to travel to
another world...
Hmm... Then I leave it up to you!
  Wait... You have a weapon!
This must be a trap... How dare you
toy with the heart of a demon...
   I still don't understand... What is it
you are planning on doing with me...?
   Hmm... The structure and content of your
sentence is solid... I shall give you
9࿌ out of 100!
  Huh!? Were you speaking? I simply cannot
hear a word you're saying!
That... That's a lie...It cannot be!
You are trying to trick me...
 I knew it...! Ha! You won't make This
easy, will you? Just as I expected...
I knew it! Even if you disguise your
spell, you can't fool my ears!
Of course! Let us move to the
international ring and aim to make
humanity a treasure of the world!
 Mo... Model? I'm not sure...
With style like that...
   You! A bad joke only makes others
feel awkward!
Hahaha, well, well... I didn't think
humans still gossiped about me!
   I... I see... But that is because you
have yet to hear, so... I know it...
 Like, "Mr. <Name>, you're awesome!"
...You! Laugh!
  Do you have any other interesting
stories? I'd love to hear them! It's
important to have common knowledge!
 It seems you do not understand my
charm... Not many can be possessed of
both beauty and power!
 ...No! Even were I to be thrown into the
darkness of hell, I could not tell you...
 You do not want to know? I can tell that
you hide the truth! You'll regret that!
   You do not want to hear? You mean that?
It makes me want to tell you...
Well, I figured that was the case...
How utterly absurd!
   Hmph! You don't have any excuses, do
you!? How utterly absurd!
 Ah, you have an excuse? What is it?
I'd be most interested in hearing it.
  I see. Then simply apologize. I won't
hold it against you if you do.
   Living without a care in the world and
then making excuses when you mess up!
Hmph! Must be a splendid life!
I see... As long as you have your
reasons.
But next time, be sure to explain
yourself first.
  Oh, you cannot hear? Then I shall have
you answer with your body!
  *sigh* I cannot comprehend you! Are you
a dimwit or a genius...?
   *sigh* I cannot comprehend you.
Humans are a strange species...
So you do! Quite rude to test my
judgement without telling me first!
   My, my! I would expect nothing less of
you, Master! I'd like this relationship
to last.
Hm? Your fortune is greater than that!
You're holding back!
When you become poor and lose all your
friends, I will be there for you!
   Judging by your actions, I cannot
believe it!
  Very well... I will believe in your
words, but just this once.
 Hahaha, no need to worry! I have my
preferences too!
   Of course! Even if this was a trap,
a gentleman always accepts gifts.
  Well... hold for a moment... There's
something I must know: You aren't
harboring any ulterior motives, are you?
Is that so...? You can never trust the
words of a human, though.
   I'm nitpicky, you say!? Hahahaha!
What an answer! Hahahaha!
My question is boring, you say!? Do you
realize a single mistake can lead to a
life or death situation!?
   You should consider who you are trying
to fool before you engage the trick.
I don't trust a word you say.
  I won't nod to every word out of your
mouth, but I may believe some of them.
   Right? There is nothing I do not know.
 Right!? You weak humans must be quite
jealous!
 How tragic! Are your eyes clouded!?
Allow me to polish them then!
  What...? To think there are humans who
cannot comprehend my body's beauty!
What is the world coming to...?
 Hahaha, you are like a child!
  No excuses! I will have you tell me what
the meaning of this is!
   Is that so...? If that's the case,
then never mind.
Haha, pardon me! It's just that your
actions lacked common sense!
  Hmph! Then watch what you do before you
get upset over what I tell you next
time!
  ...Oh my... It looks like you're the
real thing...
 You don't care what others think of
you...? Is... Is that so...? P-Please,
spare my life!
  You are quite understanding!
It seems we have good affinity.
   Correct, there is no need for pointless
bloodshed! I'm glad you are so wise.
   Then what if I said... "Hey baby, how's
it hanging!?" ...Hahaha, I jest!
   You are truly a rude person! Really,
how impolite can you be!?
 So you finally reveal your true self!
I knew true gentleman were more like
me...
   Hmph! That is called being superficial!
Have you no self control!?
 I see you are not phased by my taunt...
I cannot afford to take you lightly.
   You are a fool! It amuses me to no end
that you cannot appreciate sarcasm!
 Pardon me! It seems you were able to
understand how I have belittled you!
  It... It doesn't have any deep-seated
reason... Please, there's no need to
yell...
 Hmmm... One two, one two... That's a
rather difficult dance...
 Human fads are so bewildering! I never
tire of watching them.
  Hahaha, I knew that from the start,
Mr. Klutz!
 Hahaha, I knew that from the start,
Mr. Klutz!
 Really? You should rest a little.
Don't strain yourself so much...
 Yeah! Yeah! Yeahhhh!
   Are you alright? Breakfast is an
important meal in the day, and you
shouldn't skip it, you know.
   You! I go through the pain of inviting
you, and you have the nerve to fall!?
   Hahaha, you are like a child!
  Then would you be so kind as to tell me
what the meaning of this is!? Hmph,
there are no excuses!
  Is that so...? If that is the case,
then never mind.
   Haha, pardon me! It's just that your
actions lacked common sense!
  Hmph! Then watch what you do before you
get upset over what I tell you next
time!
  ...Oh my... It looks like you're the
real thing...
 You don't care what others think of
you...? Is... Is that so...? P-Please,
spare my life!
  You are quite understanding!
It seems we have good affinity.
   Correct, there is no need for pointless
bloodshed! I'm glad you are so wise.
   Even a demon would hesitate before
doing some of the things you do!
...You are a villain!
  I cannot relax... This is an odd
feeling...
Phew... I am quite tired... You are so
unpredictable, it's astounding!
 Hmm... My apologies then. But still,
why get so upset? Do you really have a
girlfriend?
If I were you, I would be upset. You
must have a big heart. Or maybe you're
just a fool!
   It only troubles me that you got so
angry. Anyway, you should hurry and
make her yours! Take life's next step!
 Is that so? You hold this person deep
in your heart, so you would protect them
at all costs... Correct?
Is that so...? You can never trust the
words of a human, though.
   I'm nitpicky, you say!? Hahahaha!
What an answer! Hahahaha!
You think it has no merit!? Do you
realize that a single mistake could lead
to a life or death situation here!?
You should consider who you are trying
to fool before you engage the trick.
I don't trust a word you say.
  I won't nod to every word out of your
mouth, but I may believe some of them.
   Right? There is nothing I do not know.
 Right!? You weak humans must be quite
jealous!
 How tragic! Are your eyes clouded!?
Allow me to polish them then!
  What...? To think there are humans who
cannot comprehend my body's beauty!
What is the world coming to...?
 Then I invite you to take a scenic trip
through the nine circles of hell. It's
actually quite a fun outing.
Hmmm... You should accept kindness when
it is offered. That is, if you don't
want to get hurt!
 I-I am not s-scared! Gentlemen do not
t-tremble at such ficticious stories!
I-I am not s-scared! How can I be scared
of f-fiction!?
You've finally realized it! I must say,
your low level has cost me an exorbitant
amount of time!
   I can sympathize! Our emotions
themselves are a mystery.
   I see, but you should moderate yourself.
Curiosity killed the cat, you know.
   Dreaming? Do you enjoy dreams? Then,
allow me to show you a nightmare you
shall never wake up from!
Hmph! You shall be an expert when you
can kill a man using only your voice!
Oh, is that so? How nice.
  I probably would have ripped your throat
out if you had bragged about your voice,
but you are actually quite humble!
   Hahaha, I kid! An honest answer would
only put me on the spot. Hahahaha!
   Hahaha, it's just a joke! You must have
it hard, doing this and that to try and
get on a demon's good side.
What are you looking for? A warrior to
fight by your side? Or a circus
performer? Now isn't the time to sing!
  Please, stop this! If I hear any more,
I may have reservations about killing
you!
  I do not approve of this arrogance!
You are a fool who has forgotten the
importance of knowing when to quit!
   That was wonderful... As long as I can
hear that voice sing, I don't need
anything else!
   Oh, so you understand... That was a
bit boring...
  I knew it! You hoped to bewitch me with
that soft, glistening skin, didn't you!?
   You are a pathetic human! A gentleman
does not tell lies!
  I assumed so... People like you lead
humanity to destruction... Hahaha...
  Huh? No... What did I do wrong? I-I...
I cannot fathom...
  So in the end, you are superficial!
I knew it! Humans cannot be trusted!
   You understand this difficult way of
life!? I am enthralled!
   Is that so...? You can never trust the
words of a human, though.
   You haven't a clue!? That's quite an
answer! Hahahaha!
 How irresponsible! Don't you realize
the life and death predicament that one
mistake can create for you!?
  You should consider who you are trying
to fool before you engage the trick.
I don't trust a word you say.
  I won't nod to every word out of your
mouth, but I may believe some of them.
   Right? There is nothing I do not know.
 Right!? You weak humans must be quite
jealous!
 How tragic! Are your eyes clouded!?
Allow me to polish them then!
  What...? To think there are humans who

 Then what if I said... "Hey baby, how's

   You are truly a rude person! Really,
how impolite can you be!?
 You are a pathetic human! A gentleman
does not tell lies!
  I assumed so... People like you lead
humanity to destruction... Hahaha...
  You are a good person.
 Thank goodness... And thank you. If my
disgrace were to catch wind, I would
become a social outcast.
   Argh! You are something, human!
Is... Is that so... V-Very well... Ugh!
No! My body will not move...
   What do you have to fear now? Hahaha!
Allow me!
You dare to quit after enticing me to
do so!? A gentleman never breaks his
word!
   I am no moral philosopher, but you
shouldn't do something if your heart
isn't in it!
   Hahahahaha! That short temper of yours
is proof of your foolishness!
   Oh be quiet! I've been known to eat
conceited children head first!
 You may think I am but an old man, but!
You should hear what I have to say!
Those who are willing to-sell their
souls to achieve their desires...
They're a dime a dozen!
 It seems you haven't matured enough to
understand my austere... Well, that day
will come.
  There's no need to apologize. It only
makes it harder on me.
   Ahh, I knew it... Your smile is
beautiful. Much moreso than a banshee's!
   Ahh, just as I had imagined...
Your smile could lead me to Eden!
   I... I am gross!? M-Me... gross...
Gross!? Gross... Gross...
   So you agree... I have failed as a
gentleman, but it is better than being
malicious...
 You don't understand! It is because of
women like you that my troubles never
cease!
Well... It is not something that can be
settled with a smile... Ha... You are
a unique young lady...
   I cannot undersatnd you if you're going
to sit here in tears! It is best to
ignore women like this.
No, no! Rumors will spread that I have
made a woman cry...
 Hahaha, you are like a child!
  Then would you be so kind as to tell me
what the meaning of this is!? Hmph,
there are no excuses!
  Is that so...? If that is the case,
then never mind.
   Haha, pardon me! It's just that your
actions lacked common sense!
  Hmph! Then watch what you do before you

   You are a pathetic human! A gentleman
does not tell lies!
  I assumed so... People like you lead
humanity to destruction... Hahaha...
  That will not do? Then, this is not
good... No no, if that won't do, then...
   You say the obvious with such arrogance!
   Ahh! Who could imagine something that
felt so good existed in this world!
  ...Oh! M-My shame has been exposed...
Wh-What a calamity...
...Oh! Y-You have seen my shame! For
that, I must eliminate you!
   Is that so...? You can never trust the
words of a human, though.
   I'm nitpicky, you say!? Hahahaha!
What an answer! Hahahaha!
My question is nitpicky, you say!? Do
you realize a single mistake can lead to

 How tragic! Are your eyes clouded!?
Allow me to polish them then!
  What...? To think there are humans who

What is the world coming to...?
 You are a pathetic human! A lady does
not tell lies!
   I assumed so... People like you lead
humanity to destruction... Hahaha...
  That will not do? Then, this is not
good... No no, if that won't do, then...
   You say the obvious with such arrogance!
   Ahh! Who could imagine something that
felt so good existed in this world!
  ...Oh! M-My shame has been exposed...
Wh-What a calamity...
...Oh! Y-You have seen my shame! For
that, I must eliminate you!
   Are you pretending to have no interest
in me? I do not mind, but...
Wha! What are you doing!? Get away from
me!
You do not have to cling to me. I...
I understand. Please, let go...!
  Excuse me... It must be a technique of
a rural school that I am unfamiliar
with.

  Then why did you do that to me!?
   So you liked it!? Do my jokes have
some kind of lag!?
  *ahem* Hrmmm! I was clearing my throat.
Have you no emotions!?
 *ahem* Hrmmm! I was clearing my throat.
......
 Are you pretending to have no interest
in me? I do not mind, but...
What are you doing!? This sudden change
in attitude is not good at all!
You don't have to yell...
  Excuse me... It must be a technique of
a rural school that I am unfamiliar
with.

  Then why did you do that to me!?
   So you liked it!? Do my jokes have

   Correct, there is no need for pointless
bloodshed! I'm glad you are so wise.
   Well, I figured that was the case...
How utterly absurd!
   Hmph! That has nothing to do with me in
the first place! How utterly absurd!
   Does this pertain to something else?
If so, I am interested in what.
   Oh, you cannot hear? Then I shall have
you answer with your body!
  *sigh* I cannot comprehend you! Are you
a dimwit or a genius...?
   *sigh* I cannot comprehend you.
Humans are a strange species...
I have seen the magic of Dr. Faustus,
and you are equals!
  Have you ever seen the sorcery of
Dr. Faustus? Or Merlin? Or perhaps
Crowley?
I assume the answer is no! Then do not
presume greatness until you have seen
the greats!
I enjoy the fact that you do not become
oddly modest. If I travel with you, my
days will be anything but boring.
   Hmmmmm... What fool enjoys this danger
being out in the world!?
A person this dangerous roaming through
the world freely... How dreadful...
Child, that is dangerous. It is not a
toy, thus, I shall take your weapon.
 As boring as I presumed it would be!
I've known that all along!
Well if that's how you'd put it, then...
die! ...Er... I lied. Please, just say
you'll tell me someday!
N-No... You wish to deprive me of sleep
that much?
 That is a noble objective! I shall cheer
you on from the sidelines.
So that is your answer... I wonder which
is faster: that, or human genocide!
   I understand gathering gems, but you
wish to be a hero in this day and age?
I am disappointed in you... Go have a
sandwich and play with your dolls.
  No, that's not it! I simply hate you!
  Hmm... I'd rather not admit it, but...
perhaps it's true...
That is incorrect! Nothing is more
irksome than a silly answer delivered
with a straight face!
 That is correct! I cannot go easy on
those who have been raised without any
hardships!
 Ha... That is an arrogant opinion,
fitting of you humans! ...How wonderful!
Quite rare for a human to acknowledge
his own mistake honestly... It seems
I have misunderstood you.
   Innocent demons are killed over that!?
I cannot forgive you!
   Is this the kind of human we should
entrust humanity's future to!?
 Yes, yes, yes! That time, I see! So...
When was that?
  You do not recall... But either way,
I am attracted to you!
Huh? Think before you speak! A gentleman
does not flirt!
   ...Well, no...
 I hope you will use your time for the
sake of both the world and the demons.
   Is that so? Then nothing can be done.
  You lie! Students are those who study
at a school!
 I am sure you are... And yet you stand
up to me so boldly! Quite splendid,
despite your age!
   You are not scared? Children are truly
fearless these days.
Fun? You think these bloody days are
fun? *sigh* This is going to give me a
headache...
I see... I have grown weary of this
boring life. Perhaps I should accompany
you...
 Oh, truly? If you say so, I'm sure that
it is... But disappointing nonetheless.
I am not one to fear danger! Do not
underestimate me!
  Hahahaha! Danger is precisely what I am
looking for! There is no problem!
  St-Stop it! Did you plan to take my life
out of curiosity!? I am obviously
against demon experimentation...
That is correct! Do you understand now!?
If you want something to eat, humans are
more delicious!
  Then you plan to use me for experience?
Why should I level you up!?
Ha! Then prove it to me!
   How can you be so sure? There are so
many things at this moment that could
lead to your extinction!
You are a wise man. You should give up
on humans and become a demon!
   Haha! You don't care about the human
race!?
...Well... I don't really care what
happens to demons, either.
Master... Just calling you that...
Hahaha... Hheh!
  N-No... You would deny me? ...I won't
forgive you for this!
N-No... You would deny me? ...
How cruel...
Master ᄋ...
