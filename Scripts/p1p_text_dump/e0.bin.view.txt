▶Hat-wearing student
Dude, if that really worked and I could
see my future, I'd be on easy street.
▶Hat-wearing student
You sure you ain't got the brain rot,
Hidehiko?
 ▶Smug student
Hehehe... Turns out there's more to it
than an easy joke!
▶Smug student
Maybe not seeing the future, exactly,
but weird stuff does happen!
▶Smug student
I'm willing to put my money where my
mouth is if you are, Mark.
  ▶Mark
Alright... You're on.
▶Mark
I'll bet you an all-you-can-eat dinner
at the Peace Diner on Joy Street.
   ▶Airheaded student
Woooo! I'm with Hidehiko!
  ▶Ponytailed student
I'll throw my lot in with Brown, too.
 ▶Mark
Are you guys serious?
   ▶Mark
Yo Kei, Yukino! Who're you guys gonna
side with?
▶Glasses-wearing student
Hmp. As if I cared one whit...
It's absolute bunk.
   ▶Cool-headed student
What he said... This is all you.
 ▶Mark
Ugh! You guys are so cold, y'know?
  ▶Mark
Hey, who're you with? It's gotta be
me, right?
  ▶Mark
C'mon, what's it gonna be?
▶Mark
Sheesh, you too? All y'alls crazy.

Awww! Just wait... you'll be sorry!

Awright, let's get started!

'Kay! Here goes!
   ▶Ayase
Umm.
▶Ayase
Persona! Persona!
Please come here!
   ▶Brown
My turn!
▶Brown
Persona! Persona!
Come here!
  ▶Mark
Man, why I gotta do this...?
▶Brown
Hurry it up! All-you-can-eat!
All-you-can-eat!
 ▶Mark
Okay, okay...
▶Mark
Persona, Persona.
C'mere... I guess.
   ▶Elly
Well, then...

Please come to us...

Alright! Here it comes!

Hidehiko! You jerk! Now I look like a
total idiot!
 ▶Mark
See? A fat load o' nothin'.
▶Mark
Hehe... Looks like I win.
▶Yukino
*sigh* Happy now? Hurry up and go get
the teacher.
▶Brown
W-Wait! Hold up!
▶Brown
One more time! Please!? Mark screwed
it up!
▶Brown
C'mon, you gotta take it seriously
when you do it.
▶Mark
Oh, you little...! What a sore loser.
   ▶Nanjo
H-Hey, Masao... Look... behind you.
▶Mark
Huh? Dude, that bandwagon has left the

  ▶Mark
Holy crap!
  ▶Ayase
Wh-What is that...? I-Is it... real...?
▶Elly
Quite a surprise. Last time, we only
heard noises.
  ▶Brown
Haha... Y-You see that? Just like

It's a little different this time,

I'm sorry you had to deal with my

whole job! What's so bad about us...?
 ▶Ms. Saeko
Now, now, Masao! I want you to think
about what you've done!
▶Ms. Saeko
Anyway, Eriko and Ayase told me what
happened. No helping out for you today!
▶Ms. Saeko
Instead, go get yourselves checked out
at |ԏMikage Hospital|  and head home!
 ▶Yukino
So you think something's wrong with
us, too?
  ▶Ms. Saeko
Oh, not like that. I can tell by looking
at you that you're perfectly sane.
▶Ms. Saeko
But I'm worried you might have gotten
hurt while collapsing, so go see the doc.
▶Yukino
So there is something that can faze you,
Ms. Saeko... Alright, we'll go.
  ▶Nurse Natsumi
Speaking of Mikage Hospital, wasn't a
student in your class staying there?
 ▶Mark
You mean Maki, right...?
▶Ms. Saeko
Yes, that's right.
▶Ms. Saeko
You should visit her while you're
there.
▶Ms. Saeko
She's been laid up there for over a
year now... I'm sure she's lonesome.
   ▶Ms. Saeko
What were you doing, anyway? I asked
you to prepare for the sports festival.
▶Ms. Saeko
We only have a month left and nothing's
ready yet.
▶Ms. Saeko
Should we just cancel it this year...?
 ▶Nanjo
It seems we have no choice in the
matter. Best to get it over with.
▶Mark
Mikage Hospital, huh? That's kind of
a long walk from school.
▶Mark
It's way to the northeast. You leave
the school, head north...
▶Mark
And go all the way to the 3rd ward,
then take a right at the Mikage Ruins.
▶Mark
Eh, if we just wander around, we'll get
there sooner or later.
 ▶Yukino
I know I couldn't take being cooped up
in the hospital for an entire year.

They call him Devil-Boy, but the stuff

▶Male student
I know much more about the occult. Though
I could never tell the uninitiated.
   ▶Male student
The way I see it, there must be demons
who get along well and those that don't.
▶Male student
If demons who hated each other met up,
I'm sure it would be disastrous.
  ▶Library committee student
You see that guy over there? The one
they call Devil-Boy?
▶Library committee student
He tripped and fell over again today
during PE. It was frickin' hilarious!

He can't even do a single push-up!
What a lamer!▶Drama club member
Hey, we haven't decided which play we're
doing for the culture festival, have we?
  ▶Drama club member
I heard there was a traditional play
we used to perform... Why not do that?
▶Drama club member
I think it was called The Snow--
   ▶Drama club president
Absolutely not! That one's off limits.
I'll decide soon... Give me some time.
   ▶Nanjo
Snow...? Was he going to suggest
The Snow Queen?
   ▶Mark
Who needs a play? Just lemme bust a move
up on stage!
   ▶Yukino
This school has a traditional play?
News to me.
   ▶Drama club member
St. Hermelin won the drama concours
nine years ago, too...
▶Drama club member
But the trophy from that year is missing.
I wonder what happened to it.
 ▶Drama club member
The president seemed a little touchy...
Why did she get so upset?
  ▶Drama club member
Hm? Are you interested in joining the
club?
▶Drama club member
If not, please leave. You're in our

This megalith shard... It's a very

If he can't handle the meager power of
the student council, he's no man at all.
▶Mark
I really hate this guy... Ugh! Can't we
go see Ma--I mean, go to the hospital?
  ▶Yukino
I bet we'd be better off with anyone
but him as president.
▶Student council president
Sorting old records is no task for a
student council president!
▶Student council president
Kandori would have refused to do it
as a point of pride...
▶Student council president
So I refuse too! It's all part of my
quest to be more like him!
 |♂> Student council president
Leader of St. Hermelin's student
council. Isn't wild about his job.| 
   ▶Student council member
Our president does nothing but sit around
and bark orders. Who voted for this guy?
▶Student council member
If I was president, I would make a guy
like him work 'til he keeled over!
 ▶Student council member
Those are his true colors, but he's no
dummy. He's got the faculty on his side.
▶Student council member
I hear he's never even been reprimanded.
Talk about unfair!
  ▶Student council member
He's trying to emulate Kandori, the
1ৎth student council president.
▶Student council member
Huh? You haven't heard of that bigshot
at SEBEC? He graduated from here...
▶Student council member
He's still young, but he's branch
president of a big company now.▶Nanjo
It seems you're being mistaken for
someone else, <FirstName>.
▶Mark
A guy who keeps goin' into the open
classroom on the second floor...
▶Mark
You know anyone like that?
  ▶Elly
I told Ms. Saeko about what happened.
▶Elly
Brown seems to have already gone home...
▶Elly
And I don't think Ayase could explain
it coherently, do you?
   ▶Ayase
Hidehiko took off, so me and Eriko
explained everything to the teach!
▶Ayase
Man, Hidehiko sure works fast at times
like these.
   ▶Yukino
Eriko and Yuka didn't faint, so they
don't need to go to the hospital.
▶Yukino
Why were we the only ones...?
▶Yukino
Thinking about it, the ones who didn't
faint had played "Persona" before...
▶Yukino
Meaning Yuka, Eriko, and Hidehiko.
▶Male teacher
Oh, it's you, <FirstName>.
▶Male teacher
Hey, I hear someone keeps coming in and
out of the open room on the second floor.
▶Male teacher
Are you the one doing it? Hmm?
 ▶Male teacher
If it's not you, then who's been going
into that classroom...?▶Yukino
...Someone's here.

Huh? Reiji...?

You're Reiji Kido! What're you
doin' here?
▶Reiji

Hmph. The standoffish sort, I see.
 ▶Mark
Look who's talking...
   ▶Nanjo
I wonder what he was pondering at a
place like this...
 ▶Mark
What a gloomy Gus! But hey, for all
we know...
▶Mark
Maybe he's the kinda guy who secretly
practices magic tricks at home.
 ▶Yukino
Reiji transferred here soon after the
SEBEC Building was constructed...
▶Yukino
Oh, but we still need to get to the
hospital.▶Nanjo
Say, what about the hospital? Weren't
we going there for a checkup?
▶Mark
Hey <FirstName>, you gotta hear the stupid
junk this guy is spouting.
 ▶Yukino
What's Masao's beef with that guy?
I don't see what the fuss is about.
▶Serious student
Don't you think derelict buildings
should be torn down?
▶Serious student
Places like that only attract
hooligans--
  ▶Mark
Haha! "Hooligans"? Seriously?
What a poindexter!
▶Serious student
Won't you pipe down!? As I was saying,
wouldn't it attract hooligans?

I'd certainly hate to see that happen. ▶Old man in butler's outfit

I've told you time and again never to

  ▶Yamaoka
Oh, my! Will you be going out on the
town with your chums, young master?
 ▶Nanjo
I'm only going to the hospital!
And stop calling me that!
  ▶Yamaoka
The hospital!? Heavens! I do hope you
haven't hurt yourself, young master!
   ▶Yukino
Snrk... Ahahahahah!
   ▶Nanjo
Enough! Let's be on our way, <FirstName>!

not all there upstairs, y'know?
▶Mark
C'mon, blockhead, time to go.
   ▶Reiji
Tch... You guys again.

So even you'll lend a hand to others...
Interesting. I wouldn't have thought it.

I don't like this... This isn't how

 > It's a video poker machine.
 > What will you do?♀
 > What would you like explained?ԍ
In this version of poker, you can
change your hand once.
You will be dealt five cards at the
outset.
Use the directional buttons to move to
a card, and press the íȺႨȺùȺࠁ buttons
to hold that card.
Once you have chosen which cards to
hold, press the R button to re-draw
the remaining cards.
If you have a valid hand after the
second draw, you win.
The higher the bet, the larger the
payout for a winning hand will be.
If you win, you can bet the amount
you just won on an Extra Game.
If you'd rather not risk it, choose
"Take Winnings."
There are three types of Extra Game.
Each round you win doubles your
earnings.
By winning the Extra Game, you can
wager up to 1,000,000 coins.
But be careful; one mistake and you'll
lose it all.
<Extra Game 1>
ٰHigh & Low
One card is shown, with four other
cards left face-down.
You must guess which face-down card is
higher than the shown card.
If the card you draw has the same
number as the shown card, the game is
a draw and you may try again.
<Extra Game 2>
ٰBig & Small
One card is shown and one card is
face-down.
You must guess whether the face-down
card is bigger or smaller than the
shown card.
If both cards are equal, you lose,
so be careful.
<Extra Game 3>
ٰRed & Black
One face-down card is dealt.
If you think it's ॵ or ࣚ, choose Red.
If you think it's ਏ or ࢼ, choose Black.
If the color you chose matches the
card's color, you win.

 > It's a video blackjack machine.
 > What will you do?♀
 > What would you like explained?ԍ
This is a one-on-one-game of blackjack
against the dealer.
The computer acts as the dealer.
Two cards are dealt to the player and
the dealer at the outset.
One of the dealer's two cards will be
kept face-down.
If the dealer's shown card is an ace,
you may place an insurance bet.
The insurance mechanic will be explained
at the end of these rules.
First, compare your cards to the dealer's
to decide whether to draw another card.
If you decide to draw, select Hit.
If not, select Stand.
You may draw up to 7 cards as long as
their total value remains 21 or lower.
The following circumstances will result
in an automatic Stand:
-Your initial draw is blackjack.
-The total of the cards drawn after
Hitting is 21.
-You draw seven cards.
-The cards' total value surpasses 21,
resulting in a bust.
2 through 10 are face value. J through
K are worth 10, and A is worth either
1 or 11.
After the player Stands, the dealer
will draw cards.
If your total is larger than the
dealer's without surpassing 21...
Or if the dealer busts, you win.
If you and the dealer tie, or if both
of you have blackjack, it is a draw,
and your bet will be returned to you.
Besides Hit and Stand, the player can
also choose to Double Down or Split.
 <D. Down> 
This is only an option while you still
have two cards in your hand.
You may double your bet under the
condition that you only Hit once.
This option will be unavailable if you
have fewer coins than the bet would be.
If you Double Down and beat the dealer,
your winnings will be doubled.
<Split>
You may Split if both of your initial
cards are the same value.
Your hand will be split, with a second
bet covering the other hand.
This option will be unavailable if you
have fewer coins than the bet would be.
Even after a Split, you may Double Down
on either or both hands.
However, if you split, even with a
combination of A with 10 through K...
It will be counted as 21 without being
considered blackjack.

ႬAbout insuranceႭ
An insurance bet is much as it sounds...
It can only be placed if the dealer's
first card is an ace.
Select Yes to place an insurance bet,
and No to decline.
If you select No, the game progresses
normally.
If you select Yes, you must first
pay half your bet as insurance.
If the dealer's second card is 10
through K, forming blackjack...
The initial bet is forfeited.
However...
The insurance bet will pay out at
3 to 1, and the game will end.
If the dealer's card is A through 9,
the insurance is lost and the game
progresses normally.

In this game, two dice are rolled on
screen, and you predict the outcome.
You can bet on eleven rolls, from 2
to 12, and you may bet on as many rolls
per game as you wish.
However, you may bet a maximum of 100
coins on any given roll.
If you bet on the correct roll, a
multiplier determines your winnings.
You can also stake your winnings on
an Extra Game.
In the Extra Game, you do not predict
the outcome of the roll...
Instead, any roll other than 7 wins.
The amount you win differs depending on
the roll.
If the roll is 7, the Extra Game ends
and all your winnings are lost, so be
careful.

 The closer the roll is to 7, the lower
the multiplier. This is because rolls
close to 7 appear more frequently.
Thus, the safe bet is on rolls close
to 7, with rolls like 2 and 12 being
riskier.
In the Extra Game, if a roll of 7
comes up, you lose all your winnings.
The trick to not losing too much is
not to get greedy and leave with a
reasonable amount.You have Ⴇ coins.

In this version of poker, you can
change your hand once.
You will be dealt five cards at the
outset.
Use the directional buttons to move to
a card, and press the íȺႨȺùȺࠁ buttons
to hold that card.
Once you have chosen which cards to
hold, press the R button to re-draw
the remaining cards.
If you have a valid hand after the
second draw, you win.
The higher the bet, the larger the
payout for a winning hand will be.
If you win, you can bet the amount
you just won on an Extra Game.
If you'd rather not risk it, choose
"Take Winnings."
There are three types of Extra Game.
Each round you win doubles your
earnings.
By winning the Extra Game, you can
wager up to 1,000,000 coins.
But be careful; one mistake and you'll
lose it all.
<Extra Game 1>
ٰHigh & Low
One card is shown, with four other
cards left face-down.
You must guess which face-down card is
higher than the shown card.
If the card you draw has the same
number as the shown card, the game is
a draw and you may try again.
<Extra Game 2>
ٰBig & Small
One card is shown and one card is
face-down.
You must guess whether the face-down
card is bigger or smaller than the
shown card.
If both cards are equal, you lose,
so be careful.
<Extra Game 3>
ٰRed & Black
One face-down card is dealt.
If you think it's ॵ or ࣚ, choose Red.
If you think it's ਏ or ࢼ, choose Black.
If the color you chose matches the
card's color, you win.

This is a one-on-one-game of blackjack
against the dealer.
The computer acts as the dealer.
Two cards are dealt to the player and
the dealer at the outset.
One of the dealer's two cards will be
kept face-down.
If the dealer's shown card is an ace,
you may place an insurance bet.
The insurance mechanic will be explained
at the end of these rules.
First, compare your cards to the dealer's
to decide whether to draw another card.
If you decide to draw, select Hit.
If not, select Stand.
You may draw up to 7 cards as long as
their total value remains 21 or lower.
The following circumstances will result
in an automatic Stand:
-Your initial draw is blackjack.
-The total of the cards drawn after
Hitting is 21.
-You draw seven cards.
-The cards' total value surpasses 21,
resulting in a bust.
2 through 10 are face value. J through
K are worth 10, and A is worth either
1 or 11.
After the player Stands, the dealer
will draw cards.
If your total is larger than the
dealer's without surpassing 21...
Or if the dealer busts, you win.
If you and the dealer tie, or if both
of you have blackjack, it is a draw,
and your bet will be returned to you.
Besides Hit and Stand, the player can
also choose to Double Down or Split.
 <D. Down> 
This is only an option while you still
have two cards in your hand.
You may double your bet under the
condition that you only Hit once.
This option will be unavailable if you
have fewer coins than the bet would be.
If you Double Down and beat the dealer,
your winnings will be doubled.
<Split>
You may Split if both of your initial
cards are the same value.
Your hand will be split, with a second
bet covering the other hand.
This option will be unavailable if you
have fewer coins than the bet would be.
Even after a Split, you may Double Down
on either or both hands.
However, if you split, even with a
combination of A with 10 through K...
It will be counted as 21 without being
considered blackjack.

ႬAbout insuranceႭ
An insurance bet is much as it sounds...
It can only be placed if the dealer's
first card is an ace.
Select Yes to place an insurance bet,
and No to decline.
If you select No, the game progresses
normally.
If you select Yes, you must first
pay half your bet as insurance.
If the dealer's second card is 10
through K, forming blackjack...
The initial bet is forfeited.
However...
The insurance bet will pay out at
3 to 1, and the game will end.
If the dealer's card is A through 9,
the insurance is lost and the game
progresses normally.
Since Ⴤ decks of cards are used in this
game, there is a chance that two or more
identical cards will be dealt.

 Winning the game:
If your hand is larger than the dealer's

Or if the dealer busts, you win.
Blackjack:
An A combined with a second card of
10 through K. (Automatically Stands.)
If you chose to Split, this will not
be counted as blackjack but is 21.

If you choose Stand when you've drawn
six cards without surpassing 21.

The closer the roll is to 7, the lower
the multiplier. This is because rolls
close to 7 appear more frequently.
Thus, the safe bet is on rolls close
to 7, with rolls like 2 and 12 being
riskier.
In the Extra Game, if a roll of 7
comes up, you lose all your winnings.
The trick to not losing too much is
not to get greedy and leave with a
reasonable amount.> You have ḇ֍ Metal Cards.

In this game, the numbers 1 through 9
are dispersed throughout a grid.
Your goal is to guess the arrangement
of the numbers.
The fewer tries it takes, the better
the prize you receive.
If you cannot crack it in ৎ tries,
the game ends.
The Result to the left of the screen
shows your previous attempts.
If you guess incorrectly, the guess
will be displayed in the Results.
Use it as a reference when formulating
your next guess.
The Chosen display at the top shows
the numbers in use.
All numbers, 1 through 9, must be used
in the code.
Use the Chosen display to see which
numbers are missing from your guess.

  H indicates how many exact matches
are in a rowȺcolumn.
B shows how many numbers belong in
that rowȺcolumn, but not in their
present position.
The key to the game is to determine
where a hit (H) is on both the row
and the column.
It's best to mark places where both
the row and the column are hits.
The Results of your previous guesses
can also be useful hints.▶Nanjo
I think simply "shabby" would be more
fitting for this place than "antique."
   ▶Nanjo
Hm...? Masao, is he one of your "crew"
as well?
▶Mark
Say what!? Huh...?
▶Mark
So you're the dude with the scar on his
head... What're you doin' here?
   ▶Reiji
You'd all better stay away from here.
Unless you want to die, of course...
 ▶Mark
What's that supposed to mean?
Hey, wait a sec!
  ▶Yukino
I wonder what he's wandering around
for...
▶Mark
You got business at our studio, man?
Don't think anyone's here today...

Huh? Convenience stores don't carry
weapons? That's weird...
   ▶Nanjo
Are you finished here? Can we be on our
way to the hospital now?
   ▶Nanjo
Hah... It's true, one can pick up daily
necessities at the convenience store.
  ▶Mark
So that's Reiji's mom... She seems so
classy.
▶Mark
A pretty far cry from mine... Ugh.
 ▶Mark
Is this the place Yukino works part-
time? Oh, wait, that was another store.
▶Elly
Even if we don't buy them here, everyday
objects can be useful as weapons.
  ▶Yukino
For all Reiji Kido's an oddball,
his mother seems nice.
   ▶Yukino
Sure, it's a convenience store, but being
able to buy weapons here is kinda...
▶Reiji's mother
Oh, do you go to St. Hermelin? That's
the school my son attends...
▶Reiji's mother
His name's Reiji Kido. Do you know him?♂
 ▶Reiji's mother
Oh, so you know him? Ah, you're in the
same class?
▶Reiji's mother
I see... Then you must know my son isn't
very outgoing...
 ▶Reiji's mother
It may be selfish of me to ask this,
but could you make friends with Reiji?츛
 ▶Reiji's mother
Ah, I see... I'm sorry to have been
so forward.
   ▶Reiji's mother
Ah, truly? Thank you! Please feel free
to come visit him at home sometime!
▶Reiji's mother
I see... I'm not surprised. He does
cultivate a bizarre image...
▶Reiji's mother
But deep down, he's really very sweet.

That reminds me... It's not much,
but please take this.

I hope you and my son can be friends.

Welcome!
   ▶Clerk
Our store doesn't carry weapons...
Is that all right?
  ▶Customer
Are these stores good for anything!?
Isn't it odd they don't have weapons?
  ▶Customer
Yeah! You tell 'em! A store's gotta
serve its customers' needs!
 ▶Customer
Convenience stores are supposed to stock
everything!
▶Customer
Why wouldn't they have weapons, too!?
Don't you agree?
  ▶Customer
Yes! Exactly! Shouldn't this store be
serving its customers' needs!?▶Nanjo
There's some time until our examinations.
Let's visit Maki first, then.
▶Nanjo
Best not be idle, after all.
   ▶Mark
Heh... Cold, man. By the way, Maki's in
|ԏRoom 302| .
   ▶Yukino
You're pretty well-informed, Masao.
   ▶Mark
Uh... Shut up! A friend of mine told me!
▶Mark
Yo, <FirstName>, let's just go already.
   ▶Nanjo
Hospitals certainly enjoy keeping people
waiting. Don't they know time is money?
   ▶Mark
What're you lookin' at me for?
Hurry and go!
▶Yukino
Huh. Interesting that Masao knew which
room Maki was in.
  ▶Receptionist
Hm? Maki Sonomura? Oh, yes, her...
▶Receptionist
She's in room 302.
▶Yamaoka
Oh dear, oh dear! I've been spotted.
▶Yamaoka
I would ask that you keep my presence
a secret from the young master...
   ▶College student with her boyfriend
Hoo boy... Know where the police station
is? My boyfriend crashed his motorcycle.
 ▶Mark
What's this now? The police? You mean
the place where Baldy works?
▶Mark
Yeah, just head west after you leave
the hospital.
▶College student with her boyfriend
Exit the hospital and head west...
Thanks a bunch!
▶Pregnant woman with her husband
I wonder if my honey's okay... Isn't
seeing things a sign of overwork?

I'm going to work!

If you can't handle such things, you
have no place at SEBEC! Honestly!

Oww... Testifying about accidents is
such a pain.
▶Injured man
Talk about bad luck.
 ▶Mark
Dude, you're not gonna visit Maki?
You got ice water in your veins?
 ▶Receptionist
I'm sorry. We're tied up right now,
so please wait a little longer.▶Doctor
I have to go... but you should get some
fresh air sometimes. It's good for you.

has arrived. I'll leave you kids be.
   ▶Maki
<FirstName>... You all came... Thanks.
▶Maki
You're so thoughtful, Masao.
▶Nanjo
What do you mean?
  ▶Maki
I told Masao I wanted to see everyone
when he was here last time...
▶Maki
Isn't that why you all came?
 ▶Yukino
...Yes, it is. How are you? Have you
been feeling okay?
   ▶Yukino
...Yes, it is. Oh, and Yuko said she'll
come by to return the book she borrowed.
▶Yukino
"Gate to Paradise," I think it was.
 ▶Maki
Ah... That's okay. I've read it so many
times, I practically have it memorized.
 ▶Yukino
Alright, I'll tell her next time I see
her. So how've you been? You doing okay?
   ▶Maki
Uh-huh. I'm doing much better. I wonder
if it's because of that good dream...
▶Maki
It's hard to remember, but I keep
dreaming of a really nice man...
▶Maki
He's like a father...
▶Yukino
Like that doctor? He seemed nice.
 ▶Maki
...I don't like him...
  ▶Mark
Did he do somethin' to you!?
▶Maki
No, that's not it... I just... don't
like doctors...
▶Mark
Well, let's talk about other stuff, then.
▶Mark
Hey, how about your mom? How's she doin'
at SEBEC?
 ▶Maki
She's not my mom! She cares more about
her job than me!
▶Maki
She doesn't care about me at all...
  ▶Mark
S-Sorry...
  ▶Maki
Oh... It's all right... Ngh!
▶Maki
N-Nooooo!
   ▶Mark
Maki!? What's wrong!? Hey!
  ▶Yukino
This isn't good! Call a doctor!
   ▶Nanjo
...Yamaoka.
▶Mark
I can still feel Maki here...
Hang on, Maki. We'll find you.
▶Yukino
I'm worried about Maki too, but let's get
to the streets. I have a bad feeling...
 ▶Yukino
What're you gonna do about Maki's mom,
<FirstName>?
▶Yukino
If we don't hurry, she's in trouble.
   ▶Elly
Is this Maki's hospital room...?
But it seems... so lonely...
   > It's the painting called "Gate To
Paradise" that Maki won an award for.
> You can sense Maki's pain just by
looking at it...▶Yukino
I wonder if Maki's okay...
▶Mark
...՛Dammit!
▶Yukino
Wh-What the--an earthquake!?
  ▶Mark
Whoa! It's a big one!
   ▶Nanjo
...It seems to have stopped.
   ▶Mark
Maki! Wh-What the hell!?
Th-The room's gone!
▶Nanjo
What!? What's going on here? That was
definitely the ICU...
▶Woman's voice
Aieeee!
▶Yukino
Did you hear that? It came from
downstairs! Let's check it out!▶Vacant-eyed man
F-Fresh meat... Meat is heeeeere!
▶Yukino
Wh-What's with these guys?
▶Panicked nurse
Th-The dead patients suddenly got up and
walked... That old man rescued me and...
▶Panicked nurse
Nooooo!
▶Mark
What!? These guys were dead?
Is this for real!?
 ▶Nanjo
Y... Yamaoka...?
   ▶Nanjo
Yamaoka! You bastards...
How DARE you!?▶Nanjo
Yamaoka... Don't go... You wouldn't
leave me behind, right?
▶Nanjo
Right, Yamaoka?
▶Yamaoka
Oh, young master... Don't be so sad...
It spoils your handsome face...
▶Yamaoka
You're a fine Japanese man... And a
man must stand on his own someday...
▶Yamaoka
It seems that this... will be the last
service I can provide for you...
  ▶Nanjo
No! No no no! I won't let you leave me!
▶Nanjo
Hang in there, Yamaoka!
▶Yamaoka
It's time I said farewell...
▶Yamaoka
Just one last thing... Please promise
me, young master...
▶Yamaoka
Promise to become the No. 1 man in the
country and carry Japan on your back!
▶Yamaoka
*cough* *cough*
▶Nanjo
...Of course... Of course I will.
When that time comes, you'll see.
▶Nanjo
So, until then--
   ▶Yamaoka
That's my young master... I will always
be... in your heart...
   ▶Nanjo
Yamaoka?
▶Nanjo
Hey...! Answer me... I'm begging you...
Yamaoka!
  ▶Yukino
Nanjo...
  ▶Mark
Let him alone...
▶Mark
Hey <FirstName>...
Could you hear their voices?
▶Mark
That thing said it was me.
 ▶Yukino
I heard it, too... Think it was that
Persona thing?
   ▶Mark
It said it would lend us power, so I
kinda doubt it's hostile.
▶Mark
If we're lucky, maybe it'll listen to
what we tell it...
▶Mark
I guess we might as well go on calling
it "|ԏPersona| ."
  ▶Yukino
That's how it felt to me, too... I have
a bad feeling about this. Let's go.
   ▶Yukino
I'm wondering if the school's safe.
We should get outdoors, <FirstName>.
▶Yukino
Nanjo seemed like a little boy in front
of that old guy...
▶Yukino
Failing to protect the ones you love...
Nothing hurts worse than that.
▶Nanjo
Yamaoka... What should I do...?
▶Nanjo
Without you, I'm all alone... No one
is here to encourage me...
▶Nanjo
No one... will stand by me...
  ▶Mark
I didn't think he was gonna cry...
He must've really loved that old guy.
▶Mark
I feel bad for Nanjo, but we gotta
worry about the living now.
▶Mark
Let's hurry and rescue Maki's mom.
▶Elly
So that's what happened... Losing one's
beloved can profoundly affect one.
  > He's already gone...▶Yukino
<FirstName>! This one's still alive!
Gimme a hand here!
 ▶Nanjo
We haven't time to waste here, <FirstName>!
It's too late for her, but not for us!
   ▶Mark
Yo, <FirstName>! The monsters are just
around the corner!
 ▶Severely wounded nurse
I... I'm not going to make it...
You kids... g-get out of here...
 ▶Yukino
Don't give up!
▶Yukino
I could really use a hand, <FirstName>!ԑ
   ▶Yukino
Okay, you take that side!
 ▶Mark
It's no good! They're coming!
   ▶Elly
Oh, good day.
▶Elly
Oh, my! There are demons here too?
 ▶Yukino
Are you serious!? But she's still alive!
You're telling me to abandon her!?
   ▶Nanjo
...I don't want to leave Yamaoka
behind, either.
   ▶Nanjo
But we don't have a choice! We have
to go!Ԓ
▶Nanjo
Yukino! Masao! Let's go!
   ▶Nanjo
Tsk... Don't blame me when you end up part
of the problem instead of the solution.
 ▶Mark
What're we gonna do? Now's the time to
decide, man!
 ▶Yukino
I can't leave her here! Help me!
  > You hear a dreadful roar from the
end of the hallway.▶Elly
Was that Nike...? The Greek goddess
of victory...
▶Elly
It's me... and I'm it...
   ▶Yukino
Eriko? Hey! Are you okay?
 ▶Elly
Nike... The archetypal portrayal of
Christian angels...
▶Elly
It's me... and I'm it...
 ▶Mark
No good. She's completely gone.
 ▶Yukino
Eriko! Snap out of it!
▶Elly
*gasp* I-I'm sorry... I'm all right.
▶Elly
I am an angelic bringer of victory!
From now on, you have my protection!
▶Mark
...You idiot. We can do it too.
 ▶Elly
R-Really...? So I'm not the only one
who was chosen...
  ▶Nanjo
Eriko... you dreamt of the butterfly,
didn't you?
  ▶Elly
How do you know about that?
▶Elly
I've seen it quite often in my dreams...
Ever since I played the Persona game.
   ▶Nanjo
Just as I thought. That dream must be
the cause of the phenomenon...
   ▶Mark
That aside, why'd you come here? Is it
like this outside too?
   ▶Elly
Yes... There are demons everywhere.
And it's impossible to leave town.
▶Elly
I looked everywhere, but it seems that
the school is the only safe place.
 ▶Yukino
Oh? The school's safe?
▶Yukino
Let's go back there, <FirstName>.
   ▶Elly
Oh, but I nearly forgot! We should go
to the |ԏshrine|  first.
▶Elly
Maki's mother is hurt. She collapsed
there...
 ▶Mark
What!? Dude, why didn't you say so
before!?
 ▶Yukino
Alright, let's save Maki's mom and
make a run for the school.
 ▶Nanjo
You're all so softhearted... Anyway.
The Personas, this change in town...
▶Nanjo
It all seems too pat. What could be
causing all this?
▶Mark
Maki... We'll come back for you,
I swear...
 ▶Elly
The shrine isn't far from the school.
We should have no problems.▶Reiji
So you're not lettin' me through?
Fine... then be ready to die.
▶Black-suited man
Don't make me tell ya twice.
▶Black-suited man

listen, maybe you get shot to death.

That dumbass! He's gonna get himself
killed!
▶Mark
Hahaha, sorry to butt in. This guy's
not all there upstairs, y'know?
▶Mark
C'mon, blockhead, time to go.
   ▶Reiji
Tch... You guys again.
 ▶Nanjo
So even you'll lend a hand to others...
Interesting. I wouldn't have thought it.
   ▶Mark
Idiot! Even guys like him have moms...
She'd be sad if he got gunned down.
  ▶Black-suited man
No trespassing, kiddos.
 ▶Black-suited man
This ain't no place for kids. Go find
yourselves a nice playground.
 ▶Mark
Sheesh... What is that dude up to?
  ▶Nanjo
SEBEC... What's Kandori's game?
▶Yukino
I don't like this... This isn't how
an ordinary corporation acts.
 ▶Elly
What could this mean? I heard SEBEC
was a Fortuna ࿌00 company...
▶Elly
But this may as well be a Mafia
front operation.

happens to this town...

Hey, <FirstName>? Sorry to ask, but...
▶Ms. Saeko
Could you go by the hole and ask Yukino
and the others not to fill it up?
▶Ms. Saeko
Masao and Kei might have to come back
in through there.

▶Tsutomu
It's the traditional play performed by
St. Hermelin's drama club.
▶Tsutomu
Eeeheehee... Don't be so hasty.
Listen to this...
▶Tsutomu
For some reason, The Snow Queen is
usually performed while wearing a mask.
▶Tsutomu
Which brings me to my point.
▶Tsutomu
In truth, that mask... is cursed.
▶Tsutomu
The students who wore it while playing
the role all died unnatural deaths.
▶Tsutomu
Isn't that interesting?
▶Tsutomu
Supposedly, only one girl who played
the part ever survived the curse...
▶Tsutomu
No one knows who it is.
▶Tsutomu
If we could figure that out, it might
unlock the mystery. Eeeheehee...
 ▶Male student
Hey, you! You know something, don't you?
I'm begging you, help me out!
  ▶Male student
You should be careful not to drive
people into a corner.
▶Male student
Piss off a short-tempered guy, and who
knows what he'll do?
▶Male student
I bet the same is true for demons.▶Drama club president
This is hardly the time to be thinking
about the school festival.
   ▶Drama club president
I told you, I don't know any play called
"The Snow Queen"! Give it a rest!
  ▶Drama club member
Our president's the only one who knows
about that play.
▶Drama club member
Huh? What play? Oh, uh... it's a secret.
   ▶Drama club member
Man, this sucks. What's up with this?
  ▶Drama club member
If there were any records left, you might
be able to find something in them...
▶Drama club member
But our president gets all upset if
anyone asks about it.▶Student council president
If I can get through this, I'll go down
in student council history...
▶Student council president
Hey, if you want to be helpful, run along
and solve this disaster, hmm?
  ▶Student council president
The records? I've already gone through
and sorted them.
▶Student council president
It was no small task, you know.
▶Student council president
What? You want me to show them to you?
▶Student council president
Absolutely not! You have no idea what
a pain it was to sort all those!
▶Student council president
If you want to know about the past,
go ask someone who was there!
▶Student council member
The other members and I were organizing
a safety committee while HE sat back...
▶Student council member
We never should have elected that jerk!
  |♂> Student council president
Leader of St. Hermelin's student
council. Isn't wild about his job.| ▶Principal Ooishi
<FirstName>! Thank goodness you're
all right...
▶Principal Ooishi
When I think about something happening
to one of my students, I worry so much.
 ▶Vice-Principal Hanya
This is outrageous! If something happens,
they'll hold the school responsible...
▶Vice-Principal Hanya
And we can kiss our careers goodbye!
▶Vice-Principal Hanya
If this had just happened a little later,
all the students would've gone home...
▶Vice-Principal Hanya
Why is my luck so terrible!?
▶Principal Ooishi
I heard you've been looking into "The
Snow Queen."
▶Principal Ooishi
...I'll tell you the whole story.
▶Principal Ooishi
The actress portraying the Snow Queen
here has traditionally worn a mask.
▶Principal Ooishi
But there was always something
unpleasant about that mask...
▶Principal Ooishi
Sooner or later, a rumor started that
the Queen's mask was cursed.
▶Principal Ooishi
I didn't believe it... until that day,
eight years ago.
▶Principal Ooishi
The last one to play the Snow Queen
was Ms. Saeko.
 ▶Vice-Principal Hanya
M-Ma'am! What're you saying!?
   ▶Principal Ooishi
Eight years ago... Ms. Saeko lost her
best friend.
▶Principal Ooishi
If only I'd realized it sooner...
▶Principal Ooishi
Had I forbidden the use of that mask,
none of it would have happened.
▶Principal Ooishi
...The mask was immediately purified and
put into storage.
▶Principal Ooishi
But listen to me... you mustn't bring up
Ms. Saeko's painful past.
▶Vice-Principal Hanya
H-Hey, the principal is just joking,
okay? Don't believe that junk...!
  |♀> Principal Ooishi
The principal of St. Hermelin High.
She adores children and flowers.| 
   |♂> Vice-Principal Hanya
Known as "Hamya" among the students,
who despise his extreme strictness.| 
   ▶Principal Ooishi
I never want to lose another precious
student. Take care of yourself, okay?
 ▶Vice-Principal Hanya
Huh? You're still here? I'm busy!
Get outta my sight already!
   ▶Principal Ooishi
The Snow Queen's mask... could it be
related to what's happening...?
▶Principal Ooishi
No, it couldn't be. But <FirstName>...
▶Principal Ooishi
I warn you, don't go near the gym's
storage room.> It's a box sealed with talismans.
> Open it?ԓ
 > Obtained the Ẅ♀|ԍSnow Queen Mask| .
 > There's nothing inside...
   > There seems to be nothing here.
 > The door to the stage suddenly
won't open...▶Yukino
Hey Masao! Wait!
  ▶Ayase
You don't even know if that really
is Maki!
▶Ayase
Omigod, <FirstName>!
Masao's in big trouble!
 ▶Yukino
Kei was hurt, so Masao, Hidehiko,
and Eriko brought him back here.
▶Yukino
But then...
   ▶Ayase
Maki showed up out of nowhere! Isn't she
supposed to be in the hospital!?
▶Ayase
Something's seriously wrong here!
▶Ms. Saeko
I heard Masao came back!
   ▶Yukino
Y-Yeah, but...
▶Ms. Saeko
So he and Maki went outside together?
Oh, I have to bring them back!
   ▶Yukino
Wait, Ms. Saeko! If something happens to
you, what'll the gang here do?
▶Yukino
Let us go instead!
   ▶Ms. Saeko
Oh, good point, Yukino! Thanks...
  ▶Ms. Saeko
Hm? What's that you have there,
<FirstName>...?
▶Ms. Saeko
That... that mask...!
▶Ms. Saeko
Goodness... I didn't think it was still
lying around here...
   ▶Ms. Saeko
It reminds me of my high school days...
▶Ms. Saeko
I wore this mask when I was in a play
called, "The Snow Queen."
▶Ayase
It's a neat-looking mask.
  ▶Ms. Saeko
Yes, but some say it's cursed.
▶Ms. Saeko
...I guess I can see why. It's because
of this that my friend was...
▶Ayase
C-C'mon, Ms. Saeko! Cut it out!
We've got enough to be scared of...
▶Ayase
That mask gives me the creeps! Why don't
you just throw it away?
   ▶Ms. Saeko
Oh, sorry about that!
▶Ms. Saeko
It's just a silly school legend.
"Whoever wears it, dies"? Ha!
▶Ms. Saeko
I wore it, and I'm okay, aren't I?
▶Ms. Saeko
See? So it's better if I went looking
for those two!
   ▶Ms. Saeko
I've got Lady Luck on my side.
▶Ms. Saeko
......?
*gasp*
  ▶Ms. Saeko
Aaaaaaaaagh!
   ▶Yukino
Ms. Saeko!? What's wrong!?
▶Ayase
Wh-What's going on!?
   Once upon a time, there was an
evil demon.
And one day, this demon made a mirror...
The mirror blurred out the beautiful
things of the world and made the ugly
things clear.
The demon climbed to Heaven, intending
to do mischief to God with the mirror,
but the mirror broke on the way up.
The countless splinters it broke into
rained down upon the earth.
And that is how it all began.
   There lived a boy named Kay and a girl
named Gerda, and the two were
close friends.
But one day, tiny splinters of the
mirror got into Kay's eyes and heart.
The splinters caused Kay's heart to
grow cold and his eyes to see only
ugly things.
He even began to tease Gerda, whom he
cared so much for.
  On a snowy winter day...
A big, white sleigh appeared in front
of Kay, who was playing with his sled
at the market square.
And the beautiful woman on that white
sleigh took him away.
Little did he know that the woman was
the Snow Queen!
That was how Kay came to the Snow Queen's
Ice Castle, far to the north.
  Gerda learned of Kay's disappearance,
and despite her sorrow, she decided to
embark on a journey to find him.
Along the way, she overcame many
hardships and obstacles with the warm
help of the people she met.
At last, Gerda's love for Kay and her
unwavering courage led her to the
Ice Castle.
What Gerda saw at the end of her
journey was the half-frozen Kay,
who had forgotten her completely.
Gerda's warm tears gently covered him,
melting his heart.
Upon regaining himself, Kay burst into
tears, washing away the splinter of the
mirror in his eye.
Hand in hand, the two left Ice Castle...
And lived at home happily ever after.▶Ayase
Oh, hey <FirstName>. Elly went
outside again.
▶Ayase
I tried to stop her, but of course she
doesn't listen. Talk about trouble...
▶Ayase
Is there really a passage that leads
outside of town?
 ▶Ayase
Are you guys serious? Like, what can
the three of you do, y'know?
  ▶Meek girl
U-Um... I think Yukino went inside the
school.
▶Meek girl
She said she was going to look for
something to block up the hole...
▶Yuko
U-Um... I think Yukino went inside the
school.
▶Yuko
She said she was going to look for
something to block up the hole...
  |♀> Yuko Himeno
Maki's friend. She works part-time to
support her family.| 
   ▶Ayase
Hey, if we block this thing up, is that
really gonna make us safe?
▶Ayase
Huh? We're not blocking it up anymore?
▶Ayase
Uhh... Is that okay...?
  ▶Yuko
U-Umm... Be careful...
  ▶Meek girl
U-Umm... Be careful...
 ▶Ayase
Uh, you're going too, <FirstName>?
   ▶Ayase
Gonna go trash SEBEC, huh?Ԣ
   ▶Ayase
It's like, impossible. Don't do it!
▶Ayase
Oh, so you're not?
▶Ayase
Well, yeah, I mean, we gotta do
something about the school.
 ▶Maki
Oh! Hey, <FirstName>. What're you
guys up to?
 ▶Yuko
Oh... ՇMaki...?
▶Meek girl
Oh... ՇMaki...?
   ▶Ayase
Huh? ՇIs... ՇIs that you, Maki?
  ▶Maki
C'mon, of course it is. Everyone knows
good ol' Maki!
▶Maki
What's wrong, Yuka?
▶Ayase
Woah... Like, something's seriously
weird with her, <FirstName>!
▶Ayase
There's no way Maki would be that
cheerful!
 ▶Maki
Huh? Yuka...?
▶Maki
Hey, when did that hole show up?
▶Maki
Ohhh, I get it... You made it,
didn't you, <FirstName>?
  ▶Ayase
See!? It's totally not like her!
I mean, wasn't she in the hospital!?
  ▶Maki
Yuka! I'm going to get teed off if you
keep saying that.
▶Maki
Do you WANT me to be hospitalized...?
   ▶Yuko
U-Um... ՛
I think she's the real Maki...
   ▶Ayase
How can you tell!? I bet she's, like,
a demon or something!
▶Yuko
Oh, um... ՇI'm sorry...
▶Yuko
But she has Maki's favorite compact...
  ▶Maki
C'mon, Yuka, quit picking on her!
▶Maki
Although... Is something different about
you today, Yuko...?
   ▶Nanjo
<FirstName>! What the...
Why is Maki here!?
  ▶Maki
Oh, come on! Don't you start talking
nonsense too, Nanjo!
▶Maki
What's wrong, anyway? Why are you so
bent out of shape?
▶Nanjo
N-Nonsense... I'm quite calm!
▶Nanjo
But if you must know... demons captured
that moron Masao at the |ԏpolice station| .
▶Nanjo
He mentioned getting weapons, so I went
with him, and then...
▶Nanjo
Normally, I'd leave him. Unfortunately,
he has the security card...
▶Nanjo
I'll need your help to rescue him.
 ▶Maki
Demons got Masao!?
We need to save him, <FirstName>!
  ▶Nanjo
We were able to procure some guns...
Here you are.
▶Nanjo
It seems it can be quite draining to
invoke one's Persona.
▶Nanjo
Masao became exhausted after repeated
use. That's how they caught him.
▶Nanjo
But forewarned is forearmed. Don't
forget to equip these.
 ▶Maki
Persona...? I don't get it. Oh well,
we should hurry anyway!
▶Maki
I bet it's that girl in black again...
Let's teach her a lesson!
▶Nanjo
Do you know the way, <FirstName>?
The station's north, in the 3rd ward.
  ▶Nanjo
We haven't time to dilly-dally here!
Let's be on our way.▶Maki
We have to hurry!
ՇBut what's a police station?
▶Nanjo
...This is hardly the time for jokes.
  ▶Maki
Excuse you! I wasn't kidding.
   ▶Nanjo
It's... a public service that maintains
societal order.
▶Nanjo
In this case, it refers specifically to
the service's headquarters.
▶Maki
Oh... I think I kinda remember now?
 ▶Maki
Whoa! What's with the gym back there?
When did they rebuild it!?
▶Nanjo
That happened while you were hospitalized.
▶Nanjo
It's been complete for roughly six
months... You couldn't have known.
   ▶Maki
Haha, but I was never in the hospital!
You're the kidder here, not me.
  ▶Nanjo
<FirstName>... Does she seem to be
suffering from amnesia to you?
▶Nanjo
In her condition, she'll only be a
hindrance.
  ▶Maki
What're you guys whispering about?
Let's hurry! Masao might be in trouble!
  ▶Demon
Heeheehee... You're the ones in trouble!
I'll devour you whole!
▶Maki
Looks like we got one already...
Well, bring it on!▶Maki
So, that was a Persona?
▶Maki
Persona... the soul's power...
It's another me, huh?
 ▶Nanjo
It's Latin for "mask." It's the root
of the word, "personality."
   ▶Maki
So there are angels and demons within
people's souls? Is that it?
   ▶Nanjo
That's a poetic way of putting it, yes.
▶Nanjo
As one fights fire with fire, it seems
we'll fight demons with demons.
▶Nanjo
I don't know the reasons for it, but it
should certainly prove useful.
  ▶Maki
Okay! If this is what we have to do,
let's do it!
▶Maki
Let's root out the source of these demons
and get our town back!
   ▶Nanjo
Mm... We'll need to rescue the idiot
for that. Come, <FirstName>.
▶Maki
We're not going to let that awful girl
have her way! Right, <FirstName>?
  ▶Nanjo
In a way, Kandori is a much greater
threat than the demons.
▶Nanjo
It's his twisted genius behind this
situation. Don't forget it.
▶Maki
Where are you going, <FirstName>?
We have to hurry and rescue Masao!▶Agastya Tree
Young ones... Your presence is welcome.
 ▶Agastya Tree
Will you inscribe your story on me? 
   ▶Agastya Tree
Take care on your journey, young ones...▶Agastya Tree
Young ones... Your presence is welcome.
 ▶Agastya Tree
Will you inscribe your story on me? 
   ▶Agastya Tree
Take care on your journey, young ones...▶Agastya Tree
Young ones... Your presence is welcome.
 ▶Agastya Tree
Will you inscribe your story on me? 
   ▶Agastya Tree
Take care on your journey, young ones...▶Maki
So this is... the police station.
That's right... It WAS like this!
 ▶Nanjo
Er... yes.
▶Nanjo
Masao should be detained in the prison
cells, <FirstName>.
▶Nanjo
But we can't access that section without
a key. What to do...?
 ▶Maki
They might have left it somewhere.
Let's see if we can find it.
 ▶Nanjo
True. Could you help search,
<FirstName>?
> Found the Prison Key...
> Obtained the Ẅ♀|ԍPrison Key| .
   > There don't seem to be any more
useful keys...
  ▶Nanjo
Excellent! We should be able to access
the prison cells now.
   ▶Nanjo
Masao should be in the prison.
▶Nanjo
I'm loathe to rescue him, but he does
have the security card.
   ▶Maki
Prison... Oh, yes, the prison cells.
Yes, that's right, they did have those.
▶Maki
Hey, <FirstName>... Nanjo keeps saying
something's wrong with me. You think so?
   ▶Brown
'Fess up, <Nickname>... You came to save
me 'cause you thought I'd blown it, huh?
▶Brown
Boy, were you wrong!
▶Brown
I'd already come up with a super-daring,
super-awesome escape plan, y'know.
▶Brown
Maaan, now I'll never get to use it...
   ▶Nanjo
I'm wondering if we should have left
those two locked up once we had the card.
 ▶Mark
Baldy better not let the demons
overtake the police that easy!
▶Mark
Me and Baldy... I mean, that lieutenant,
had run-ins before, and it pissed me off...
▶Mark
But he really was worried about me.
Could that demon have...?
▶Mark
Nah, it can't be... There's no way that
dude would lay down and die, right?
  ▶Maki
The prison door won't open without
a key, right?
▶Maki
Let's find that first.
  ▶Nanjo
They must keep the key in here somewhere.
Try searching a little more.▶Mark
Who the hell do you think you are,
lockin' us up in here like this!?
▶Mark
You won't get away with this!
   ▶Brown
Q-Quit it, Mark... Getting them mad at
us won't help any!
▶Brown
We should play nice for now and...
   ▶Brown
Huh?
   ▶Maki
Hey, there they are! You okay, Masao?
▶Maki
...Huh? Hidehiko's here too!
   ▶Nanjo
Hah... A cage suits this monkey.
   ▶Mark
Nanjo, you dickweed! What took you guys!?
▶Mark
Wait a sec... Maki?
▶Brown
Hey, it's you guys. Ohhh, I get it...
You missed me that much, huh?
▶Maki
Hey, Hidehiko? Why were you gonna play
nice with us?
▶Brown
Urgh...
▶Nanjo
Most likely, he mistook us for someone
else. Fortunately, we're on your side.
▶Nanjo
Isn't that good to hear, Hidehiko?
▶Nanjo
But tell me... Why are you here, too?
We thought only Masao had been detained.
▶Maki
That can wait for later. Let's get
them out!
▶Brown
I thought even a tough guy like me
couldn't beat demons without weapons.
▶Brown
So I came here looking for some, but
I ended up getting caught with Mark!
 ▶Mark
Shuddup, Hidehiko! Just... shut up!
▶Mark
Maki... Why're you here?
▶Mark
It must've been a long trip... Are you
feelin' okay!?
▶Maki
C'mon, Masao, why're you joking around
like that? I'm totally fine!
 ▶Mark
S-So I see... Okay, then. Anyways--
 ▶Brown
...Who's there!?
   ▶Lieutenant
Masaooo... You're not allowed out on
your owwwn.
  ▶Policeman
It's against the ruuules.
  ▶Mark
Look, Baldy, this is goin' too damn far,
even for a joke. I haven't done anything!
  ▶Nanjo
Wait... something's wrong.
Masao, they're--!
   ▶Policeman
Lieutenaaant, this kid broke out of
priiison.
  ▶Lieutenant
I seeee... Vicious criminals must be
execuuuted.
  ▶Mark
Ugh, that stink... Don't tell me...!
▶Demon policeman
Execute, execute, ex, ec, ute,
eheheheeeexecuuuute!
  ▶Demon lieutenant
That's riiiight! Men... kiiill theeeem!
 > Used the Ẅ♀|ԍPrison Key| ...▶Brown
Hey, wh-what was that!? Why was I--
What was that thing!?
  ▶Nanjo
You too, eh, Hidehiko? But why him,
of all people...?
  ▶Mark
Alright, lemme explain it to you.
Listen up...
  ▶Brown
Awesome! I really am a superhero!
▶Brown
Ever since I was a kid... I suspected
something was different about me...
▶Mark
I don't think he really gets it...
Oh well.
▶Mark
Anyways, I'm comin' too, <FirstName>.
▶Mark
I'd be nervous for you guys if you were
on your own.
  ▶Nanjo
We could say the same about you.
▶Nanjo
You should leave the security card in
<FirstName>'s care, Masao.
▶Mark
Alright...
▶Mark
Here's the security card, man. Better
not lose that thing...
  ▶Nanjo
We have a firearm for you, Masao.
Just don't shoot us by mistake.
  ▶Brown
Hey, hey, think I should come with
you guys?
▶Brown
Without me, you fools don't have any
star power, y'know?
▶Brown
You guys need me to whip you into
shape! How about it, <FirstName>!?
   ▶Mark
...It's your call, <FirstName>.ԏ
 ▶Nanjo
Are you certain that you want to bring
Hidehiko along? 
   ▶Nanjo
Are you certain that you don't want to
bring Hidehiko along? 
 ▶Brown
Great! I'm down--not like I have a
choice! Hahahahaha!
 ▶Nanjo
Then here's a firearm for you, too,
Hidehiko. Don't be careless with it.
▶Nanjo
...What's that look for...?
   ▶Brown
Oh? Is that... Really? You're sure
you won't regret it?
▶Brown
Alright... Guess I'll head to the
school, then. Later, chumps!
 ▶Maki
Hooray! Now that everyone's together...
Uh, where were we going?
▶Nanjo
Hold on tight to that security card.
▶Nanjo
We need it to get into the secret freight
entrance at the abandoned factory.
  ▶Mark
I can't believe ol' Baldy turned into
a demon... This is so messed up!
  ▶Brown
Should my battle cry be "Let's go!"
or "Persona!"?
▶Brown
...Nah, those are both too lame. Maybe
something like, "Go get 'em!"▶Maki
Oh! Elly! Wow, it's good to see you!
How've you been?
   ▶Elly
Maki...? When did you get out of
the hospital?
▶Elly
But then, I suppose now isn't the
time for such questions.
▶Elly
I'm glad to see you all safe.
   ▶Mark
So this place is out too, huh?
  ▶Elly
Yes... I took a look around to be
certain, but it's all buried...
▶Elly
It seems there really is no way out.
   ▶Brown
Isn't it dangerous to stay here?
▶Brown
Go find somewhere safe and leave this
to me! I'll handle it lickety-split!
▶Ayase
Hey, it's kinda dangerous to be here
alone. Shouldn't you go somewhere else?
   ▶Elly
I know... But I can't pass up an
opportunity like this.
▶Elly
I'm going to look around town some more.
Stay safe, all of you.
  ▶Elly
Thank you, but I'll be fine. Well, I'll
be seeing you.
  ▶Elly
How about all of you? Have there been
any new developments?
 ▶Mark
Actually, yeah. It's a long story,
but here goes...
 ▶Elly
Is... is this true? All that really
happened!?
▶Elly
I'm sad I wasn't there to witness it...
▶Elly
But it sounds like it's only just begun.
There should be more chances for me!
▶Elly
Won't you take me with you, <FirstName>?
There's so many things I'd love to see.
▶Elly
Please, let me come along!ԏ
▶Nanjo
Are you sure you want to bring Eriko
with us? 
▶Nanjo
Are you sure you don't want to bring
Eriko with us? 
  ▶Elly
Wonderful! I'll help, I promise!
▶Nanjo
Then I should issue you a firearm
as well, Eriko...
▶Nanjo
I don't like making a woman carry a gun,
but there's nothing to be done about it.
  ▶Maki
Why did we come here, anyway?
   ▶Brown
Why couldn't you have gone off somewhere,
Mark? I'd rather have Elly than you.
 ▶Nanjo
So the subway is unusable... Then escape
from this town really is impossible.
  ▶Mark
Elly sure has guts...
   ▶Elly
I'm so happy! How many people get to
experience something like this?
▶Ayase
*sigh* Like, what's gonna happen
to us...?▶Maki
Huh, so this is what it's like inside.
Isn't this exciting!?
▶Elly
No wonder they put up the facade of a
legitimate corporation.
▶Elly
This is one elaborate device...
▶Brown
*whistle* What in the world do they
need with something like this?
 ▶Ayase
That's where I was standing!? I was in,
like, big trouble!
 ▶Nanjo
Masao! Are you TRYING to kill me!?
 ▶Mark
Hahahaha, sorry, man.
▶Mark
(Tch... guess he won't go down that
easy...)
   ▶Maki
Masao, <FirstName>, hurry on down here.▶Ayase
Is this for real!? They look WAY
too strong!
   ▶Mark
Watch it, Ayase! You go hide somewhere
while we take care of this!
  ▶Maki
It's all so amazing... like some kind of
sci-fi film...
 ▶Nanjo
<FirstName>! If you see anything else
suspicious, think before you touch it!
▶Nanjo
Honestly, that Masao... It makes me angry
all over again to think about!
▶Mark
This is nuts... If they're building this
kinda crap, they must be serious...
▶Elly
I'd wager there are many demons beyond
this point...
▶Elly
Ahaha! It's simply marvelous!
   ▶Ayase
Urrrgh, that was kinda gross... Is there
something like that inside me, too?
   > Ride the elevator?▶Ayase
The hell!? What was that!? I beat 'em!
 ▶Mark
So Ayase's got it too... What's it
all mean?
▶Nanjo
Hm...
  ▶Ayase
Huh? Is someone gonna let me in on the
secret or what?
 ▶Nanjo
Very well, I'll explain.
▶Nanjo
Then again, we don't have much concrete
information to relate...
  ▶Ayase
Huh... So, like, what am I supposed to
do with this?
   ▶Mark
Who knows?
  ▶Maki
Well, we won't get anything done if we
sit around here, so let's get going!
 ▶Maki
Yuka can do it, too. It's like destiny
at work!
 ▶Maki
It's all so amazing... like some kind of
sci-fi film...
 ▶Nanjo
That "Persona" game must be the power's
underlying cause...
▶Nanjo
<FirstName>! If you see anything else
suspicious, think before you touch it!
▶Nanjo
Honestly, that Masao... It makes me angry
all over again to think about!
▶Mark
I feel like someone's pawn, and I ain't
liking it one bit!
  ▶Mark
This is nuts... If they're building this
kinda crap, they must be serious...
▶Ayase
I don't get this at all... it's, like,
too much to deal with at once...
▶Ayase
Urrrgh, that was kinda gross... Is there
something like that inside me, too?
   ▶Brown
Man, do I ever love this suspense! Just
wait until I get my shining moment!
▶Elly
I'd wager there are many demons beyond
this point...
▶Elly
Ahaha! It's simply marvelous!
   ▶Elly
We must hurry after Mr. Kandori!
> Ride the elevator?▶Nanjo
So this is the delivery entrance. Just the
sort of thing Kandori would think of...
 ▶Maki
Hey, didn't Masao say he drew this?
It's really good! He's pretty talented.
 ▶Elly
Mark drew this graffiti? He may not
look it, but he's quite the artist.
 ▶Brown
You really think so? Isn't it lame,
though...? I could do way better.
  ▶Mark
Heheh... Maki and Elly definitely have
good taste in art.
   ▶Mark
What!? Don't go dissin' my piece!
   ▶Nanjo
Hold on a moment. You... came here
often, yes?
 ▶Mark
Hell yeah! This place is like a studio
for my buds in the Tailors.
  ▶Nanjo
So you used this place as a hideout...
and never noticed SEBEC's involvement?
  ▶Elly
That's... unbelievable...!
  ▶Brown
Get outta town! Haha... that's our Mark.
Way to go, Moron-in-Chief!
▶Mark
Shuddup! It's like, you know, how stuff
under your head is hard to notice!
  ▶Nanjo
That's "under your nose," you dunce!
   ▶Maki
Ahahaha! C'mon, that's enough...
Let's find the entrance.
   ▶Elly
Shh! There's someone over there...
  ▶Brown
H-Hey... Is there something over there?
...Go check it out, Mark.
  ▶Mark
There's something over there! Hey!
Come out and show yourself!
  ▶Ayase
Is that... <FirstName> and the others?
C'mon, don't scare me like that!
  ▶Nanjo
Is that you, Ayase? What on earth are
you doing here?
  ▶Elly
Ayase, if you're here alone...
Did something happen at school?
  ▶Brown
You came by yourself, Ayase? Pretty hard
to swallow...
 ▶Ayase
Hey! I, like, barely got out alive!
▶Ayase
Can't you be a little nicer to me?
 ▶Maki
Got out alive...? Yuka, did something
happen at St. Hermelin!?
  ▶Ayase
Oh man, it's like, awful. That stuff
about the school being safe was bogus.
▶Ayase
St. Hermelin's just, like... gone.
 ▶Maki
No way! Then what happened to Yuko
and everyone?
▶Maki
Did you run away by yourself!?
  ▶Ayase
How should I know!? Like I have any idea
what's going on...
▶Maki
<FirstName>! We have to go rescue
everyone!
   ▶Nanjo
Calm down, Maki. The school most likely
vanished due to the Deva System's effects.
▶Nanjo
In which case, our best course of action
is to make Kandori undo it.
▶Ayase
I'm coming with you! If I stay here
alone, I'll be totally hosed.
  ▶Elly
Mmm... I'm not so sure. It'd be safer
if you found a hiding place, Ayase.
   ▶Nanjo
Eriko is right. It'll be dangerous for
you without the power of Persona.
▶Nanjo
Find a secure hiding spot.
▶Brown
Nothing good ever happens when Ayase's
around... As leader, I forbid it!
   ▶Nanjo
This idiot's babbling aside, it would
be dangerous for you without a Persona.
▶Nanjo
Find a secure hiding spot.
   ▶Ayase
What the hell!? You guys are so mean,
picking on me like that!
▶Ayase
Well, fine, assholes!! Go to hell!
  ▶Mark
Ayase, huh...?
  ▶Ayase
Woo-hoo! That's the spirit, <FirstName>!
You know the score!
 ▶Nanjo
Here's a gun for you... Just try not to
get in the way.
▶Maki
It's decided, then. Let's split up and
look for an entrance!
▶Mark
You're coming alone, too? Dude, you
should just hide until this blows over.
 ▶Ayase
No! No no no no no no no no!
I'm coming, and THAT'S FINAL!
 ▶Maki
Alright, we get it! You guys are okay
with this?
▶Mark
Tch... I don't think she's givin' us
a choice.
  ▶Nanjo
Now, there must be a machine nearby
where we can use the security card.
▶Nanjo
I suggest we split up and look for it.
 ▶Mark
Heheheh, I bombed this wall myself.
▶Mark
That's what graf writin' is about...
Lettin' your soul shout loud and proud.
 ▶Maki
Something's off about this town and
the people in it...
▶Maki
Huh? Wh-What? I don't think the machine
is over here...
  ▶Brown
If you find anything, report it to the
leader at once. By which I mean, me.
▶Elly
I can't find a machine to use the card
with anywhere.
   ▶Maki
I feel kinda sorry for Yuka...
  ▶Nanjo
Kandori... I sensed he was a crafty one
when I met him at a business party...
▶Nanjo
But I didn't imagine he could be this
audacious.
 ▶Nanjo
Is that you, Ayase? What on earth are
you doing here?
▶Nanjo
It's rather unusual to see you alone.
▶Ayase
Count yourself lucky, <FirstName>,
'cause I'm coming with you. Got it?
   ▶Maki
Where are you going, <FirstName>?
We have to find the entrance.
   ▶Maki
Yuka!? What happened to the school?
▶Maki
What happened to Yuko and everyone?
Did you run away by yourself!?
   ▶Ayase
How should I know!? Like I have any idea
what's going on...
▶Nanjo
Calm down, Maki. The school most likely
vanished due to the Deva System's effects.
▶Nanjo
In which case, our best course of action
is to make Kandori undo it.
▶Mark
What's the word? Are we gonna bring
her along?ԏ
▶Mark
Yo <FirstName>, are you seriously
takin' Ayase with us? 
 ▶Mark
Yo <FirstName>, are you seriously not
gonna take Ayase with us? 
 > Found the security card reader!
 ▶Mark
You find somethin', <FirstName>?
  ▶Mark
Huh! Man, so that's where it was!
   ▶Nanjo
What's the matter?
 ▶Mark
<FirstName> found the machine we're
supposed to use the card on.
▶Mark
C'mon, let's give it a try.
   ▶Nanjo
Wait. We don't know what will happen.
Let's think this through--
   ▶Mark
Man, whatever. C'mon, fork it over.
 ▶Mark
Huuuuuh?
▶Nanjo
I told you to wait!
▶Maki's voice
Wh-What's going on? Something happened
to the lights...▶Nanjo
Don't touch anything suspicious without
a very good reason! Got that, Masao!?
  ▶Mark
Yeah, yeah, I got it.
   ▶Nanjo
Well then, <FirstName>, let's go.
▶Maki
Kandori... I wonder what he's like.
 ▶Maki
Kandori... Oh, um, it's nothing.
Let's go after him!
▶Mark
Man... Setting this thing up in our
studio... not cool.
 ▶Mark
Dude, I really dug this place. Now it's
all jinxed!
 ▶Nanjo
I'd say our team is rather lacking in
solemnity. It makes me a bit anxious...
  ▶Nanjo
Do you really think this is the time to
loiter around, <FirstName>!?
▶Nanjo
Heaven only knows what Kandori may do
if we don't hurry and find him!
   ▶Elly
To tell the truth, I've had an interest
in SEBEC for quite some time now.
▶Elly
I'm very curious to see what's in
store here!
  ▶Elly
Where are you going? Our foe is within
SEBEC! At least, I think he is...
▶Brown
S-Sure, you can go first. I hate to
keep the leader waiting.
   ▶Brown
Hey, c'mon! You don't see Kandori
running away, do you?
▶Brown
If you wanna turn tail, I can definitely
sympathize, but show some backbone!
▶Brown
You can start by going in there first!
▶Ayase
Uh, hey, are we like, seriously going
in there? Why not just call it off?
  ▶Ayase
Oh, cool, are we going home? I'm ALL
for that! Whaaaat...? We're not!?
 > Take the elevator? 
> There's no need to use the security
card anymore.
   ▶Maki
C'mon, <FirstName>! Let's go!▶Stern-faced man
Who's there? More children?
How did you get in here!?
▶Takeda
Who's there? More children?
How did you get in here!?
 ▶Suspicious-looking man
This is a disgrace, Takeda. First that
brat, and now this.
▶Suspicious-looking man
When did my company become a nursery?
 ▶Kandori
This is a disgrace, Takeda. First that
brat, and now this.
▶Kandori
When did my company become a nursery?
   ▶Nanjo
I see you haven't changed, Kandori.
You're like an ass in a lion's skin...
▶Nanjo
Pushing your luck, aren't you? Does
President Saeki know about this?
▶Kandori
My, my, the young master of the Nanjo
Group. No, the old man knows nothing.
▶Kandori
But this is preposterous...
▶Kandori
Your mother would spank you if she knew
you had stooped to breaking and entering.
▶Kandori
Or is that your senile butler's job?
 ▶Nanjo
Silence! You... Don't think I'll easily
forgive this!
  ▶Mark
Yo, quit grandstandin', man. You're
gonna pay for what you did!
 ▶Maki
This guy's... Kandori...?
   ▶Elly
He's just as I imagined. He has all the
insolence of a storybook villain.
   ▶Brown
He doesn't look so tough. I'll let you
take him down, <Nickname>!
▶Brown
Let the leader deal with the boss!
▶Ayase
Not cool, mister! Don't talk down to
us, okay?
▶Ayase
And what's with those balls you're
rolling around? Only geezers use those!
  ▶Kandori
...Undisciplined children are no better
than dumb beasts.
▶Kandori
Takeda. Take them from my sight. Do it
however you like, just don't make a mess.
 |♂> Takeda
Kandori's right-hand man who carries
out SEBEC's illegal operations.| 
 |♂> Takahisa Kandori
The ambitious branch president of SEBEC.
Sinister rumors circulate about him...| 
▶Mark
That prick! Where'd he go!?
 ▶Nanjo
There's no sign that he used the door...
There must be another way out.
▶Maki
...That's Kandori, huh...?
Where have I...?
 ▶Elly
Is something wrong, Maki? You don't
look well.
  ▶Brown
Huh? Why the long face, Maki?
  ▶Ayase
What's wrong, Maki? You look all
intense and serious and stuff.
▶Mark
Hm? Wassup, Maki? You look all down.
▶Maki
Huh? O-Oh, I'm okay. It's nothing.
▶Maki
C'mon, let's hurry after him!
 ▶Nanjo
There must be another way out.
I'll keep watch.
▶Nanjo
Find the exit... quickly.
  ▶Mark
Man, who'd have thought he was another
Persona-user?
▶Maki
It's nothing, really. I just felt
a little faint.
▶Maki
But thanks for worrying about me!
  ▶Elly
Kandori's Persona...
▶Elly
The faceless god... the Crawling
Chaos...
▶Elly
A bizarre and evil entity known by
countless names... It embodies malice.
  ▶Brown
No one told me the other side could
use Personas too!
▶Brown
Aren't we kinda in trouble now?
  ▶Ayase
Get it together, <FirstName>!
He got away!
   > It's a switch. Press it? 
  ▶Mark
Bingo! Good work, <FirstName>!
▶Nanjo
A hidden path, eh? He seems to love
his cheap tricks...
▶Maki
<FirstName>! Let's hurry after him!
   ▶Brown
Why don't you check for traps and stuff,
<Nickname>?
▶Elly
Are you wounded, <FirstName>?
If not, then let's go.
  ▶Ayase
Oh, are we going? Urrrgh, okay, okay!
  ▶Maki
He screwed up my town... He's going down!
▶Maki
Huh? Ahaha... it's nothing.
C'mon, let's go!
   ▶Mark
Let's catch that dickwipe and put an
end to this!
   ▶Nanjo
His makeshift ambition given form is
most likely carefully hidden ahead.
   > There's no need to press the switch
again.▶Kandori
Dr. Nicholai. Are the adjustments
complete?
  ▶Dr. Nicholai
Please reconsider this, Mr. Kandori!
Stop the system and atone for your sins!
   ▶Kandori
Preposterous. It's the rest of mankind
that must atone.
▶Kandori
What I've done here is nothing more
than to facilitate that process.
   ▶Dr. Nicholai
But that young man... You didn't have
to send him into the dimensional rift!
▶Dr. Nicholai
What did you hope to gain by throwing
away a child's life!?
 ▶Kandori
I won't allow anyone to stand in my way.
Not even a child...
▶Kandori
Judgement will come regardless. It's
only a question of sooner, or later.
 ▶Mark
You're not goin' anywhere, mister!
  ▶Nanjo
Your time has come, Kandori!
   ▶Kandori
Ah... I had a feeling you'd come. So you
beat Takeda? He always was useless...
   ▶Brown
Guys like that are no sweat to us.
Give it up! We're taking you in!
▶Brown
Surrender now and we'll let you off
with a life sentence!
  ▶Elly
I have nothing but contempt for sore
losers like you... Surrender already.
  ▶Ayase
C'mon, I got stuff to do! I don't have
time to waste on your sorry butt!
▶Ayase
Just give up already and let us take
you away!
▶Kandori
Loud noises from young children...
I don't have time for you.
▶Kandori
I have matters to attend to...
Come, Dr. Nicholai.
   ▶Mark
Wait!
   ▶Nanjo
So this is the Deva System. What are
Kandori's plans for this!?
▶Maki
This machine... I... Where do I know
this thing from...?
▶Brown
Whoooooa! Wh-What the--!?
  ▶Elly
What is this? What's going on!?
 ▶Ayase
Yikes! Wh-What the hell--!?
▶Maki
Gah! What the...?
   ▶Kandori's voice
Ngh!? What's happening!?թ
Grraaaaaaaaah!
▶Kandori's voice
I... I'm disappearing! Nicholai!
What's happening!?
  ▶Dr. Nicholai's voice
It's over, Sir. You and I are going
down together!
▶Dr. Nicholai's voice
For your treachery, for your crimes,
for all mankind... you will atone!
   ▶Kandori's voice
Nicholai, you swine! H-How dare you
betray me!?
  ▶Dr. Nicholai's voice
Young man! If we are reduced to our
component atoms, the system will stop!
▶Dr. Nicholai's voice
The barrier enclosing this town will be
released! Leave us and escape!
▶Kandori's voice
You out there! Boy! Stop the system!
 ▶Mark
C'mon, old man! You don't have to
throw your life away...
   ▶Mark
Let's save him! There's no need for the
old guy to die just 'cause of Kandori!
▶Mark
We'll smack down Kandori ourselves!
That's what we came for, isn't it!?
   ▶Nanjo
Wait! The old man must have invented the
system. He's taking responsibility...
▶Nanjo
We should respect his wishes. We don't
even know how to stop the machine.
   ▶Brown
Y-Yeah! Let's listen to the old dude!
▶Brown
If we don't get outta here quick, we're
in big trouble!
  ▶Elly
There's no time for debate, <FirstName>.
Let's rescue him, quickly.
   ▶Ayase
This is totally out of hand!
Do something, <FirstName>!
  ▶Maki
<FirstName>!
▶Maki
Here! This'll stop the machine!
The blue button increases the output...
▶Maki
But the red button is the emergency
stop! If you push it, we can save him!
 ▶Nanjo
Maki...? Where did you learn that!?
▶Maki
I don't know how I know, I just know!
▶Maki
<FirstName>! Hurry!
  ▶Nanjo
Be an adult about this, <FirstName>.
▶Nanjo
There comes a time when one must take
responsibility for one's actions.
 ▶Mark
Whatever! Death is the end of the
line, man!
▶Mark
As long as you're alive, you can still
do good!
 ▶Brown
Let's run away--I mean, get outta here!
As your leader, I'm begging you!
   ▶Elly
Stay strong. There may be people to
whom that old man is precious...
▶Maki
I've had enough! I don't want any
more deaths...
▶Maki
No one wants to die, right?
▶Maki
We can catch Kandori anytime. This man
needs our help!
   ▶Kandori's voice
Gaaaaaah! H-Hurry and... stop the
machine...!
▶Maki
N-No way...! It didn't stop!?
   ▶Brown
It, uh... It looks like it's actually
getting worse now...
 ▶Ayase
H-Hey! What did you do!?
   ▶Elly
Eek! Wh-What's happening?
   ▶Kandori's voice
What in the... I'm rematerializing!
I see...թ It's you... You're calling for me!
▶Dr. Nicholai's voice
H... How can this be!? My plan should
have worked perfectly!
▶Dr. Nicholai's voice
Don't tell me... Is she--!?
 ▶Maki
You!
▶Girl in black
 ... ... ... I won't let you kill my Daddy!
Let's leave now, Daddy!
▶Kandori's voice
Heh... Heheh... Hahaha! I refuse to
die! Now... take me to your world!
   ▶Mark
Whoa! Wh-What the!?
 ▶Nanjo
Ugh... K-Kandori...!
   ▶Brown
Waaaaaugh!

Ooooh, I've had enough!

Maki! A-Are you okay!?
  ▶Maki
...Nggh...
  ▶Maki
...Ma...Շsao...?
   ▶Nanjo
Ungh...
▶Nanjo
Where am I...?Շ
Oh, <FirstName>. You're all right.
  ▶Brown
Owwww... My hip...
 ▶Brown
Y-Yes! We're alive, <Nickname>!
▶Brown
Go me! I'm the luckiest!
▶Elly
Oh...
   ▶Elly
Where am I? Ah, <FirstName>.
Are you hurt anywhere?
   ▶Ayase
...Urrrgh.
 ▶Ayase
Owww! I've had it! I'm going home!
Like, why is this happening to me!?
 ▶Nanjo
Looks like everyone's unhurt.
We certainly have the devil's luck.
  ▶Elly
...This is our school's gym. But it's
the one from six months ago...
▶Brown
Hey... is this the gym!? But it's the
old one from six months ago...
   ▶Ayase
Hey, uh... This is the gym, right?
▶Ayase
Didn't they tear this one down six
months ago...?
   ▶Maki
I get it... We've gone back...
  ▶Mark
Gone back? To six months ago!?
C'mon, Maki, snap out of it!
 ▶Nanjo
You mean a time slip? That's rather
different than what your mother said.
  ▶Maki
...I've told you before, I don't have
a real mom.
▶Maki
I never thought the stuff Yosuke was
saying was... actually true...
▶Harried girl
Oh! There you are! It's really bad,
Maki! Yosuke got seriously hurt!
▶Harried girl
That girl in black came back again...
   ▶Maki
No way! Th-That's impossible! Yosuke!
   ▶Mark
H-Hey! Maki!
▶Elly
Could this "Yosuke" be Yosuke Naito?
▶Elly
As I recall, he went missing along with
Chisato Kasai roughly two months ago.
   ▶Brown
Y'think "Yosuke" is Yosuke Naito?
▶Brown
He ran away with his girlfriend Chisato
two months back, didn't he?
  ▶Ayase
Could "Yosuke" be that guy Yosuke Naito?
▶Ayase
Didn't he, like, run off with Chisato
a couple months ago?
▶Nanjo
...That dolt. I can't believe she took
off on her own at a time like this.
▶Nanjo
Come, <FirstName>. We'd better go
after Maki.
 ▶Nanjo
...<FirstName>. Don't you think Maki is
acting oddly for an amnesia victim?
▶Nanjo
Is this really six months ago? That girl
did come here looking for Maki...
▶Nanjo
But Maki was hospitalized six months
ago as well.
 ▶Mark
Yosuke, huh...?  I get it...
Oh, uh, what's up, <FirstName>?
 ▶Elly
A time slip... Do you think it's true,
<FirstName>?
▶Elly
Something tells me that isn't the
case here.
   ▶Brown
Is this place really our school?
Doesn't it look like somewhere else?
▶Brown
Oh, duh! It's all a dream! Of course!
Hahaha...
  ▶Ayase
"Time strip"? Is that what they're
calling it now?
▶Ayase
Awww, this sucks! Am I behind the
times on the latest trends?
   ▶Female student
I think Maki likes Yosuke. I'm jealous...
They'd make a cute couple.
  ▶Nanjo
You there. How many days are left until
the sports festival?
   ▶Female student
Uch, you're always so rude. The sports
festival is still a month off.
▶Female student
You have amnesia or something, Nanjo?
  ▶Nanjo
...So the date's the same. Tell me,
which year am I in?
▶Female student
What the... You really DO have amnesia!
We're all second-year students.
▶Female student
Man, I gotta tell the others about this!
 ▶Nanjo
Everything's the same as when we left.
Stranger and stranger...
▶Restless boy
Ahaha... ahahaha... It looked like you
guys showed up outta nowhere.
▶Restless boy
I must've been dreaming! Ahahahaha!
 ▶Mark
Hey... isn't this the school gym?
The one they tore down six months ago?
▶Mark
H-Hey, Maki!
▶Mark
Could Yosuke be that guy who went
missing a couple months ago?▶Injured boy
<FirstName>? Is it really you?
▶Injured boy
I didn't think I'd see people from the
original world here!
   ▶Mark
What? Oh, don't tell me... Are you
Yosuke Naito? The guy who went missing?
  ▶Yosuke
Yeah, that's me! About two months ago,
Chisato...
▶Yosuke
She and I wandered into this world.
I'm from the same place you are!
   ▶Nanjo
You said, "this world."
▶Nanjo
Then this isn't the past, but another
dimension, or another world, yes?
▶Yosuke
Yeah. I thought it was the past too,
at first.
▶Yosuke
Everything here is exactly the same as
it was a year ago.
▶Yosuke
Some things are weird, though.
▶Yosuke
The police station turned into a forest,
and the hospital is a castle...
▶Yosuke
And Maki there was just like you see her.
▶Yosuke
Yeah... It was practically a paradise...
Until last month.
  ▶Nanjo
A parallel world...
▶Nanjo
The "many worlds" theory, where
countless similar worlds exist.
▶Mark
Seriously? We thought you ran off with
Chisato, but you were in another world?
▶Mark
I want to say that's completely nuts...Շ
But then again, we're in the same boat.
 ▶Elly
This is fantastic!
▶Elly
Oh, how marvelous! It's just like in
a novel!
 ▶Ayase
Is this for real? Awww... I had plans
for this weekend!
▶Ayase
What're you gonna do about it,
<FirstName>!?
 ▶Brown
What!? Then how are we supposed to get
back? Sheesh...
 ▶Nanjo
It's hard to believe, but it isn't out
of the question for the Deva System...
  ▶Yosuke
Yeah, I can see that...
▶Yosuke
I didn't think you'd bring back this
world's Maki, though.
   ▶Mark
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
▶Mark
You're saying... Maki really is Maki,
but not the one we know?
 ▶Maki
I'm sorry!
▶Maki
I wasn't trying to lie... I just wasn't
sure until I got back here.
▶Maki
I never even thought there was another
world, let alone that I'd go over to it.
▶Nanjo
I see. No wonder your words and actions
seemed amiss...
▶Maki
I was dozing off in class, and when
I woke up, I was in another world.
▶Maki
I didn't figure it out until much later.
  ▶Mark
Oh, man...
▶Mark
Then the real Maki is still somewhere
in that hospital...
▶Mark
Couldn't you have at least said
something, uh... շMaki?
 ▶Maki
I'm sorry, I really am. But if I did
mention it, would you have believed me?
▶Maki
I just thought if we beat Kandori, both
worlds would go back to normal...
▶Maki
That's why I figured I'd wait until it
was all over to tell you.
   ▶Mark
Huh... Wait a sec. I don't see Chisato.
Where is she?
   ▶Yosuke
Chisato was... Well, that girl in black
took her... Dammit!
 ▶Brown
Whoa! Wh-What the!?
▶Elly
What in the...? What's going on!?
   ▶Ayase
Eeeek! Oooh, I've had it!
What is WRONG with this place!?
  ▶Maki
Don't tell me it's that girl again...!
  ▶Girl's voice
Ahahahaha! I'm gonna bring down this
dumb school for sure this time!
▶Girl's voice
I took away the exits! Now no one can
escape! Ahahahahahahaha...!
   ▶Yosuke
There's no mistaking that voice...
It's that girl!
▶Yosuke
Did she say she removed the exits!? If
demons show up now, we'll be slaughtered!
  ▶Yosuke
Dammit... I gotta go!
 ▶Maki
Wait, Yosuke! Don't strain yourself!
▶Maki
Everyone... give me a hand. We have to
do something!
▶Mark
I'm not sure what's goin' on here, but
at this rate, we can't get outside.
▶Mark
Let's do this, <FirstName>!
 ▶Yosuke
Dammit! If only I wasn't so banged up,
I could get Chisato back this time...
▶Yosuke
Huh? My wounds?
▶Yosuke
Oh... The last time that little girl
was here, she kicked my ass...
▶Yosuke
Man, talk about pathetic!
 ▶Maki
That girl must be somewhere in
the school!
▶Maki
Don't let your guard down just because
she's a kid. She has strange powers...
 ▶Nanjo
What sort of relationship does that girl
have with Kandori?
▶Nanjo
There's too little data to draw a useful
conclusion...
 ▶Mark
There's no use sitting around and
worrying over this!
▶Mark
We gotta take action and find a way
back home.
 ▶Brown
Oh man, you think there really is a
way to go back?
▶Ayase
<FirstName>! You better find a way back!
 ▶Elly
A girl who controls demons...
▶Elly
Sounds like a devil summoner to me.
|♂> Yosuke Naito
A ladies' man who went missing along
with Chisato Kasai two months ago.| ≻ 
  ▶Mark
Hmm... So does that mean Chisato's
still with that brat in black?
   ▶Yosuke
Ugh... I was with her, too... ՛Dammit!
   ▶Reiji
Kandori's kid, maybe? I hate to think
of that bastard having kids...▶Girl under attack
Gaaaah! A-A demon!
 ▶Brown
Don't worry, miss! Everything will be
A-OK now that I'm here!
▶Brown
Now go get 'em, <Nickname>!
   ▶Elly
Are you all right? There's nothing to
worry about now.
  ▶Ayase
Oh! Are you okay?
▶Ayase
<FirstName>! What're you standing
around for!?
 ▶Maki
Whoa! Are you okay!? Alright, demon,
hold it right there!
   ▶Demon
Ah, more have arrived. My fists thirst
for blood this night...
▶Demon
I shall grow flowers of blood to my
heart's content.
▶Mark
Yo, man, it's dangerous! Step back!
▶Mark
W-Wait, are you... Are you Reiji!?
   ▶Reiji
You guys? Stay back... This one's mine.
▶Demon
Mm... a feisty child.
▶Demon
In acknowledgement of your bravado,
I'll kill you first.
▶Demon
Regret your inexperience in Hell!▶Mark
Dude, even you can use a Persona?
   ▶Reiji
What? Then you can all...?
 ▶Nanjo
That seems to be the case. By the way...
You appear to be the real Reiji.
  ▶Reiji
What's that mean?
  ▶Elly
This world looks very similar to ours,
but it isn't. Do you see?
▶Brown
Heheh, prick up those ears and I'll
tell you all about it.
▶Brown
This place is and isn't the school
we know.
▶Brown
It's a school... in another world!
Pretty shocking, huh? Huh? Շ*siiigh*
▶Ayase
That's what I wanna know! Can you
believe this place is another world?
▶Ayase
I'm, like, totally lost here.
   ▶Nanjo
Kandori sent us here, to an alternate
world. I take it you met the same fate.
▶Nanjo
That scientist mentioned a young man
sent through the dimensional rift...
▶Nanjo
You, I presume? So why are you here, safe
and sound? Why are you pursuing Kandori?
 ▶Reiji
...As I was drifting through a vast,
empty space, a kid in white appeared...
▶Reiji
When I came to, I was here. That's all...
You don't need to know the rest.
▶Maki
A child wearing white...?
   ▶Mark
C'mon, drop the hotshot act. We're gonna
smack Kandori around and find a way back.
▶Mark
You should come. I bet your mom's
worried about you.
  ▶Reiji
Shut up! I got no reason to join your
little crew! I'm playing this my way.
▶Mark
What's with that attitude!? Guess that'll
teach me to be worried about you!
▶Mark
Fine, do what you want. Like I give a
damn if you wind up dead, idiot.
▶Mark
What's with that guy? All I do is bring
up his mom and he goes nuclear...
  ▶Maki
Stop it, Masao. It's useless...
He's got that look in his eyes.
▶Maki
I'm sure Kandori hurt something
precious to him, just like us...
 ▶Elly
Something precious...?
  ▶Brown
Alright, no more questions!
▶Brown
Everyone has things they hate to talk
about, right?
▶Nanjo
Are you ill, Hidehiko? That's rather
considerate, coming from you.
▶Nanjo
You seem to be a man sensitive to
others prying into his past, yes?
 ▶Brown
Wh... What? Straight shooters like me
are pretty rare, y'know?
▶Brown
I wouldn't be surprised if they named
me a national treasure someday!
   ▶Nanjo
Perhaps I spoke too soon...
Shall we be going, <FirstName>?
  ▶Brown
Nanjo!? What's up with that? See if you
ever get to talk to a national treasure!
   ▶Ayase
Huuuh? Is that what's wrong with him?
I thought he was just antisocial...
  ▶Maki
Was that... Reiji? I'm sure even Reiji
has things that are important to him.
▶Maki
Friends, maybe... or it could be his
hopes for the future.
  ▶Ayase
Hopes for the future? Psh...
▶Ayase
Who cares about the future? I wanna have
fun right now! What a dweeb...
   ▶Maki
This place isn't your world. I don't
know how else to explain it.
   ▶Reiji
What? That bastard's here, too...!?
▶Reiji
Alright... I'll go with you.
   ▶Maki
It's decided, then! Nice to meet you,
Reiji! I'm Maki Sonomura!
 ▶Reiji
......
 ▶Maki
What, is something on my face?
շOh, I get it!
▶Maki
You were admiring me. Well, I am pretty
cute! It's only natural.
  ▶Mark
C'mon, we can't keep wastin' time here.
Let's go already!
   ▶Maki
Reiji said a child wearing white
rescued him, right?
▶Maki
Could that have been Mai...?
▶Maki
I've seen her several times, but she's
a very mysterious girl...
▶Mark
That idiot...
   ▶Mark
C'mon, let's get a move on already!
▶Mark
Huh? Whaddaya mean, what's got me so
pissed off? Shuddup, dude!
  ▶Nanjo
Leave him be. We're after the same man,
so we're sure to see one another again.
▶Nanjo
He can do what he wants so long as he
doesn't get in our way.
  ▶Nanjo
You're asking me why Reiji is after
Kandori?
▶Nanjo
Mm... we'll find out eventually. For now,
it's enough that our goals dovetail.
▶Elly
Something important... Someone who's
precious... <FirstName>, do you...
   ▶Elly
Do you have someone precious to you?Ԥ
  ▶Elly
I see... ՇI... ՇI'm sorry to ask such an
odd question...
  ▶Elly
I see... ՇYou're like me, then...
  ▶Brown
Dude, it's not nice to try to dig up the
skeletons in a guy's closet.
  ▶Brown
You must have stuff you're hiding too,
right?ԥ
▶Brown
See? See? Am I right or am I right?
That's just how people are!
▶Brown
That's a joke, right? Was our friendship
that shallow...?
  ▶Ayase
It's no use worrying about what might
happen, don't you think, <FirstName>?
  ▶Ayase
As long as I'm having fun now, who cares
about tomorrow?ԣ
 ▶Ayase
Thought so! You and me, like,
think alike.
 ▶Ayase
...What!? That's stupid! Stupid, stupid,
stupidstupidstupidstupidstupid!
   ▶Reiji
That Maki girl... I don't think this is
the first time we've met. Who is she...?
   ▶Girl who was under attack
Is his name Reiji? He's so awesome...
  |♂> Reiji Kido (Nickname: Reiji)
A quiet loner who transferred to
St. Hermelin High six months ago.| ▶Maki
Hey! There she is!
  ▶Girl in black
Heeey! You're the ones who were making
trouble for my Daddy!
   ▶Maki
You better fix the school, or I'll spank
you 'til your butt swells up twice as big!
 ▶Girl in black
No way, Jose! I don't listen to anybody
but my Daddy!
▶Aki
Try and stop me, flatty!
   ▶Maki
Flat--!? Oh, that does it!
What a little brat!
  ▶Mark
Cool it, Maki... She's just a kid.
You gotta have patience with--
   ▶Aki
Shuddup, monkeyboy! Ook ook, eek eek,
it's a monkeyboy!
  ▶Mark
What did you call me, you spoiled brat!?
▶Nanjo
Calm down, monkeyman.
  ▶Mark
Nanjo, you jerk! You're next!
   ▶Aki
Geez, won't you shut up!? Now would
be a good time... for you to die here!
   ▶Aki
Erusaer Tsymmom!
Come out, Tesso!
▶Tesso
Tesso! Tesso! Sgweaaaaak!
  ▶Elly
Mark! This is no time to fool around!
   ▶Brown
Yikes! C'mon people, look alive!
   ▶Ayase
Hey, like... some weird thing just
showed up!
  ▶Aki
Get them, Tesso!
 ▶Reiji
...You'd all better snap out of it,
or it'll be your funeral.▶Aki
Hey! Grrr... I'm gonna tell my Daddy
on you!
▶Aki
Daddy's REAL strong! You guys won't
stand a chance!
   ▶Maki
Hold it right there!
▶Maki
Aww...! She got away again.
 ▶Nanjo
...Who is that girl...?
▶Yosuke
Is everyone okay!?
▶Maki
Yosuke! Is everything all right!?
   ▶Yosuke
Yeah! The school's back to normal,
thanks to you guys.
▶Elly
It was my pleasure.
 ▶Brown
Mwahahah! No need to thank me!
Just doin' what's right.
▶Ayase
You could never have enough lives for
all the trouble you get into...
▶Ayase
Though it's not like it'll do any
good to tell you.
  ▶Yosuke
I really can't thank you guys enough.
By the way... I want you to meet someone.
▶Yosuke
Would you mind coming with me?
   ▶Nanjo
Why?
   ▶Yosuke
There's a guy who's helped me out since
I came here. He actually believed me...
▶Yosuke
He's investigating the two worlds...
Maybe he's figured something out by now.
▶Mark
Wow, I'm kinda surprised someone took
you seriously. Who is this guy?
   ▶Yosuke
Uh... you'll see. Alright, I'll be
waiting at the |ԏlibrary| .
▶Elly
What's with him, I wonder? In any case,
let's head to the |ԏlibrary| .
  ▶Brown
H-Hey! Ugh, he's already gone.
Is he really hurt...?
   ▶Ayase
We're going somewhere else AGAIN!?
Don't we get, like, a break...?
 ▶Mark
So you wanna stay here alone, Ayase?
▶Ayase
All right! Sheesh! Stupid Masao...
Monkeyboy! Ook ook, eek eek!
▶Mark
Hey! Did you just call me monkeyboy!?
AND Masao!? Quit using that lame name!
▶Maki
That's enough, you two! C'mon,
<FirstName>, let's get to the |ԏlibrary| .
 ▶Mark
Don't worry about it.
   ▶Mark
Uhhh... wow. He just went off hopping
on one leg...
▶Mark
Wanna go after him then, Reiji?
  ▶Reiji
......
 ▶Mark
Man! You really don't know how to play
along. You gotta take it easy, y'know?
   ▶Reiji
...Leave me alone...
   ▶Mark
Whatever you say, man. Alright, let's
get going, <FirstName>.
 ▶Maki
I wonder if he's the one Yosuke means...
If so, he'll definitely be at the library.
 ▶Nanjo
That girl referred to Kandori as her
father, but is she really his child?
▶Nanjo
This is the first I've heard of him
having a daughter.
   ▶Mark
Ugh, that brat pisses me off! She's not
getting away with it next time!
 ▶Mark
Man, Ayase has a filthy mouth...
▶Mark
But I guess some guys like her like
that. What is this world coming to...?
  ▶Mark
That Reiji jerk sure acts strange
around people.
▶Mark
Hey, let's you and me do something
about it.
▶Elly
Yosuke has lost someone dear to him,
too... It must be hard.
▶Brown
Kids can be cruel, y'know. They don't
know when a game's not funny anymore.
▶Brown
What was she gonna do if we ended
up dead?
▶Brown
Oh, wait, she was always planning to kill
us. Hahaha! Man, that's disturbing...
 ▶Ayase
I wanna hurry and get back already.
▶Ayase
I SHOULD be chilling at the club
right now.
▶Reiji
...I told you to leave me alone.
   ▶Maki
That reminds me... Where did everyone
from this world go?
▶Maki
You were here, Masao was... Everyone
was here.
 ▶Mark
It looks just the same as our stone.
Hard to believe it's another world...
  ▶Elly
...Oh, sorry. I was just thinking about
something.
  > Hiremon Stone
This megalith was excavated when the
school was first built in 1963.

> Legend has it that a heavenly being
known as Hiremon dropped it from the
sky to be Mikage-cho's guardian stone.▶Tsutomu

me about you.

me about you.
▶Tsutomu
It seems you're having a unique
experience... I'm rather jealous.
   ▶Mark
...Are you really Tsutomu? Dude...
He's talking like a normal person!
   ▶Elly
You're speaking normally... Are you
really Devil-Boy?
   ▶Brown
Hey, what happened to your creepy laugh?
This isn't like you, Devil-Boy!
   ▶Ayase
Hey, no fair talking normally with a face
like that! It makes you even creepier!
   ▶Tsutomu
Hm... the me on the other side must be an
odd duck indeed. I'd like to meet him.
▶Everyone
......
   ▶Tsutomu
Hmm. Then, visitors, let us get down
to business.
▶Nanjo
We heard you're investigating the two
worlds. What are your thoughts thus far?
 ▶Tsutomu
The things in this world seem to be
unrelated...
▶Tsutomu
But they are all connected by the
strings of fate.
▶Tsutomu
The same holds true for the black door
that suddenly appeared.
▶Tsutomu
Only those who can draw on that
strength may learn the truth.
▶Tsutomu
Unfortunately... that does not seem
to be my role.
  ▶Nanjo
Our coming here was inevitable. Which
means... it's on us to solve everything.
 ▶Tsutomu
I don't know who spun the thread, but
that's a helpful way to think of it.
▶Tsutomu
Now, name this man you pursue who holds
the string's end.
   ▶Maki
Takahisa Kandori...
   ▶Tsutomu
Hm. Exactly the name I expected.
▶Tsutomu
In truth, I knew beforehand that these
incidents would occur...
▶Tsutomu
...thanks to the prophecy of a certain
monkey-suited gentleman at the shrine.
   ▶Mark
Monkey-suited!? There's nothing gentle
about monkeys!
   ▶Nanjo
Will someone shut this dumb ape up!?
   ▶Mark
Look who's talking, bib boy!
▶Reiji
...What a bunch of children.
   ▶Elly
Shut up! Stop it, both of you!
  ▶Ayase
Haha! Ook ook!
 ▶Brown
This "monkey-suited gentleman" must
be Mark's uncle or something!
  ▶Maki
Hey, Tsutomu... This guy... Did he
wear a mask?
 ▶Tsutomu
Y-yes... He said his name was Philemon,
but... should we do something about them?
▶Maki
Oh, it's fine. Just ignore them,
they're always like that!
▶Maki
<FirstName>, let's try our luck at
the |ԏAlaya Shrine| .
▶Maki
I've met that man before too...
Maybe he knows where Kandori is!
▶Maki
This door... I don't like the way
it feels...
   ▶Mark
Dammit! I'll settle this, just you wait!
▶Nanjo
For heaven's sake! Thanks to this idiot,
I forgot what I was going to ask!
 ▶Reiji
...I told you to leave me alone.
   ▶Elly
This world's Devil-Boy seems reliable.
Though he could work on his looks...
 ▶Brown
Devil-Boy, huh? This is pretty funny,
actually... But I can't get used to it.
  ▶Ayase
Whaaaat? We're going ALREADY!?
▶Ayase
You're the first guy who's ever dragged
me around this much.
▶Tsutomu
With your stamina, I'm sure you'll be
fine no matter what you face.
▶Tsutomu
Though you're a rather unruly crowd...
 ▶Yosuke
The Alaya Shrine is right where it was
in our world. Find a way home.
▶Yosuke
And...Շ If you happen to see Chisato,
save her for me. I'm begging you...
 > You can hear an eerie beating from
the other side of the door...
▶Tsutomu
You're curious too, I see. This door
appeared during the incident last month.
▶Tsutomu
I've tried everything, but it won't
budge.
▶Tsutomu
Though if the threads of fate lead
there, even this door must open.

My name is Igor... I am delighted to
make your acquaintance.
▶Igor
This place exists between dream and
reality, mind and matter...
▶Igor
It's been quite some time since we last
had a guest.
▶Igor
This is a room that only those bound by
a "contract" may enter...
▶Igor
From this day forth, you will be our
guest in this Velvet Room.
▶Igor
Your destiny will require you to hone
your power...
▶Igor
And for that, you will inevitably
require our help.
▶Igor
The Velvet Room is also known as the
room of Personas.
▶Igor
A Persona is a side of you that shows
itself when you face the world...
▶Igor
Think of it as a facade of protection
you wear to face hardships in life.
▶Igor
Hm... Perhaps that may have been rather
difficult to understand...
▶Igor
To battle opponents that cannot be
dealt with by human strength alone...
▶Igor
We in this room will lend you inhuman
power... The power of demons...
▶Igor
Now then. Allow me to explain my role
here...
▶Igor
I will assist you in giving birth to
new Personas.
▶Igor
The demons contained within the |ԏspell
cards|  you hold will be fused as one...
▶Igor
Thereby creating a new Persona.
▶Igor
Should you find yourselves with these
cards, please do bring them here.
  ▶Igor
Welcome to the Velvet Room...
   ▶Igor
What is it you desire?
▶Igor
Well then, what would you like
to know?Ԡ
   ▶Igor
I'm afraid you don't have enough |ԏspell
cards|  to give birth to a new Persona.
▶Igor
Alas, we cannot look after any more
Personas.
   ▶Igor
What would you like to do?Ԟ
▶Igor
Well then... Farewell...
▶Igor
If it's new Personas you want, I shall
fuse and create them for you.
▶Igor
First, though, I must summon demons to
fuse together into a Persona.
▶Igor
And for that, a certain type of card
is necessary.
▶Igor
You see, these cards are inscribed with
demon-summoning spells.
▶Igor
They are known as spell cards, and all
demons carry one.
▶Igor
Thus, in order to perform a fusion, I
will need you to gather spell cards.
▶Igor
Go forth, negotiate with demons,
and bring these spell cards back here.
▶Igor
Combat is not the only way to deal
with demons... Do you understand?
▶Igor
And not all demons are necessarily
wishing for a fight...
 ▶Igor
It isn't enough merely to fuse a new
Persona in order to make it your own...
▶Igor
There is rather more to it than that,
I'm afraid.
▶Igor
You must take a Persona onto yourself
in order to use its power.
▶Igor
Each of you is capable of holding up
to three Personas.
▶Igor
A newly-fused Persona will be entrusted
into my care.
▶Igor
By all means let me know when you
would like to take on new Personas.
▶Igor
But I can only look after 16 Personas
at a time, mind you.
▶Igor
There are as many Personas as there are
personalities... an infinite variety.
▶Igor
Each has its own form and substance,
to be used according to the situation.
▶Igor
If you can master that principle,
you will make a fine Persona-user.
▶Igor
Each of you can take on as many as
three Personas at once.
▶Igor
Of the three, only one can be actively
invoked during battle.
▶Igor
To invoke a Persona is to summon it
in combat.
▶Igor
The remaining two will remain on
standby...
▶Igor
Ready to be assumed at any time
during battle.
▶Igor
Different active Personas will grant
you different abilities.
▶Igor
Without the power of Persona, you are
no different than an ordinary human...
▶Igor
You will be powerless before the arcane
might of the demons' spells.
▶Igor
If by chance you were hit by a spell in
that state, you would be struck down.
▶Igor
But by taking on a Persona, your defense
against spells is considerably enhanced.
▶Igor
For some, it may also confer strength,
or increase luck for others.
▶Igor
This, too, is the power of Persona.
▶Igor
Though they are called Personas, each
is a hidden side of yourself.
▶Igor
I suggest you examine your status
carefully after assuming one.
▶Igor
That way, you can see which of your
qualities have changed.
▶Igor
At first, you will be unable to harness
your Persona's powers to the fullest.
▶Igor
But the more you invoke a Persona,
the more powers it will grant you.
▶Igor
As your Persona learns new skills, you
will have more options in battle.
▶Igor
Even if your Persona learns a powerful
skill, the SP required remains constant.
▶Igor
You will grow in combat, but do not
forget that your Personas grow as well.
▶Igor
Pardon me for being nosy, but...
▶Igor
Personas have eight levels of growth.
You should try to develop them fully.
▶Igor
I'm sure that there will be an ample
reward for doing so...
▶Igor
You might also be interested to know
about various factors in fusion.
▶Igor
For example, even when creating the
same Persona...
▶Igor
The combination of spell cards, the
affinities of the demons used...
▶Igor
The position of Terra and Luna, and any
essences added into the mix...
▶Igor
All of these factor into the resultant
Persona. And one more thing...
▶Igor
You may also add an item into the
fusion to trigger a change.
▶Igor
There are some items for which the
result is easily predictable...
▶Igor
But sometimes, even I will be unable
to guess at what may happen.
▶Igor
Should that come about, I do hope that
you'll pardon me.
▶Igor
But make no mistake, I do believe it
is worth trying...
▶Igor
I suggest gems for obtaining a higher-
or lower-ranked fusion within an order.
▶Igor
As for the other items' effects, you
should experiment for yourself.▶Bizarre-looking man

From this day forth, you will be our
guest in this Velvet Room.
▶Igor
Your destiny will require you to hone
your power...
▶Igor
And for that, you will inevitably
require our help.
▶Igor
The Velvet Room is also known as the
room of Personas.
▶Igor
A Persona is a side of you that shows
itself when you face the world...
▶Igor
Think of it as a facade of protection
you wear to face hardships in life.
▶Igor
Hm... Perhaps that may have been rather
difficult to understand...
▶Igor
To battle opponents that cannot be
dealt with by human strength alone...
▶Igor
We in this room will lend you inhuman
power... The power of demons...
▶Igor
Now then. Allow me to explain my role
here...
▶Igor
I will assist you in giving birth to
new Personas.
▶Igor
The demons contained within the |ԏspell
cards|  you hold will be fused as one...
▶Igor
Thereby creating a new Persona.
▶Igor
Should you find yourselves with these
cards, please do bring them here.
  ▶Igor
Welcome to the Velvet Room...
   ▶Igor
What is it you desire?
▶Igor
Well then, what would you like
to know?Ԡ
   ▶Igor
I'm afraid you don't have enough |ԏspell
cards|  to give birth to a new Persona.
▶Igor
Alas, we cannot look after any more
Personas.
   ▶Igor
What would you like to do?Ԟ
▶Igor
Well then... Farewell...
▶Igor
If it's new Personas you want, I shall
fuse and create them for you.
▶Igor
First, though, I must summon demons to
fuse together into a Persona.
▶Igor
And for that, a certain type of card
is necessary.
▶Igor
You see, these cards are inscribed with
demon-summoning spells.
▶Igor
They are known as spell cards, and all
demons carry one.
▶Igor
Thus, in order to perform a fusion, I
will need you to gather spell cards.
▶Igor
Go forth, negotiate with demons,
and bring these spell cards back here.
▶Igor
Combat is not the only way to deal
with demons... Do you understand?
▶Igor
And not all demons are necessarily
wishing for a fight...
 ▶Igor
It isn't enough merely to fuse a new
Persona in order to make it your own...
▶Igor
There is rather more to it than that,
I'm afraid.
▶Igor
You must take a Persona onto yourself
in order to use its power.
▶Igor
Each of you is capable of holding up
to three Personas.
▶Igor
A newly-fused Persona will be entrusted
into my care.
▶Igor
By all means let me know when you
would like to take on new Personas.
▶Igor
But I can only look after 16 Personas
at a time, mind you.
▶Igor
There are as many Personas as there are
personalities... an infinite variety.
▶Igor
Each has its own form and substance,
to be used according to the situation.
▶Igor
If you can master that principle,
you will make a fine Persona-user.
▶Igor
Each of you can take on as many as
three Personas at once.
▶Igor
Of the three, only one can be actively
invoked during battle.
▶Igor
To invoke a Persona is to summon it
in combat.
▶Igor
The remaining two will remain on
standby...
▶Igor
Ready to be assumed at any time
during battle.
▶Igor
Different active Personas will grant
you different abilities.
▶Igor
Without the power of Persona, you are
no different than an ordinary human...
▶Igor
You will be powerless before the arcane
might of the demons' spells.
▶Igor
If by chance you were hit by a spell in
that state, you would be struck down.
▶Igor
But by taking on a Persona, your defense
against spells is considerably enhanced.
▶Igor
For some, it may also confer strength,
or increase luck for others.
▶Igor
This, too, is the power of Persona.
▶Igor
Though they are called Personas, each
is a hidden side of yourself.
▶Igor
I suggest you examine your status
carefully after assuming one.
▶Igor
That way, you can see which of your
qualities have changed.
▶Igor
At first, you will be unable to harness
your Persona's powers to the fullest.
▶Igor
But the more you invoke a Persona,
the more powers it will grant you.
▶Igor
As your Persona learns new skills, you
will have more options in battle.
▶Igor
Even if your Persona learns a powerful
skill, the SP required remains constant.
▶Igor
You will grow in combat, but do not
forget that your Personas grow as well.
▶Igor
Pardon me for being nosy, but...
▶Igor
Personas have eight levels of growth.
You should try to develop them fully.
▶Igor
I'm sure that there will be an ample
reward for doing so...
▶Igor
You might also be interested to know
about various factors in fusion.
▶Igor
For example, even when creating the
same Persona...
▶Igor
The combination of spell cards, the
affinities of the demons used...
▶Igor
The position of Terra and Luna, and any
essences added into the mix...
▶Igor
All of these factor into the resultant
Persona. And one more thing...
▶Igor
You may also add an item into the
fusion to trigger a change.
▶Igor
There are some items for which the
result is easily predictable...
▶Igor
But sometimes, even I will be unable
to guess at what may happen.
▶Igor
Should that come about, I do hope that
you'll pardon me.
▶Igor
But make no mistake, I do believe it
is worth trying...
▶Igor
I suggest gems for obtaining a higher-
or lower-ranked fusion within an order.
▶Igor
As for the other items' effects, you
should experiment for yourself.▶Agastya Tree

That masked man... I wonder who he is.
  ▶Nanjo
Oh yes, that's right. Maki said that
she'd met the masked man, too.
▶Mark
Wonder why there's always a butterfly
flying around...
  ▶Elly
This world is completely fascinating.
   ▶Brown
There's nothing nice about meeting
a creepy guy like that!
 ▶Ayase
I had a dream about that butterfly
man, too.
   ▶Reiji
We're sure that butterfly has nothing
to do with Kandori, right?
   ▶Mark
No one's here... Did Tsutomu pull
a fast one on us?
 ▶Nanjo
But this world's Tsutomu seemed
reliable... What's that?
 ▶Nanjo
Say, Masao... isn't that butterfly...?
 ▶Elly
Oh! It's that butterfly from when we
found Maki's mother collapsed here.
▶Ayase
What a pretty butterfly... What say
we catch it and keep it as a pet?
  ▶Brown
You're into butterflies, Nanjo?
▶Brown
What, are you the kind of guy who gloats
over his room full of specimens?
  ▶Reiji
Could this be one of his traps...?
▶Reiji
One false move and I'll catch it
and crush it.

No... ԮI... Ԯfeel faint...!▶Agastya Tree

   ▶Agastya Tree

Kandori... So he's in this town, too.
   ▶Ayase
Kandori's here, too? Aw man, I have,
like, a really bad feeling about this!
▶Brown
Kandori, huh? Even a total stud like me
would rather not deal with that guy...
 ▶Reiji
Kandori... So the bastard's here...
Saves us the trouble of looking for him.
   ▶Mark
He said there's a demon in the subway.
And this, uh... Exp... Expel...?
 ▶Nanjo
The |ԏExpel Mirror| . He said if we have it,
we can cross to the east side.
▶Nanjo
Kandori evidently wasn't satisfied with
simply overtaking our town...
▶Nanjo
But I'll teach him that his brand of
greed will be his ruin.
 ▶Maki
But I've never even heard of this
"Expel Mirror" before...
  ▶Nanjo
Hm... I feel as though I've heard that
name somewhere...
▶Nanjo
What do you think, <FirstName>?
 ▶Maki
The wall dividing this town is new.
We used to be able to go across town.
   ▶Nanjo
I know I've heard of that mirror
before... it's on the tip of my tongue.
   ▶Mark
"Expel" sounds like a pretty old-timey
name for it.
 ▶Brown
So, uh... he said there's a monster
in the subway, yeah?
▶Brown
I... 舅don't really need to go to the
east side. H-Haha... just kidding...
▶Brown
A monster in the subway, huh?
▶Brown
...We're gonna have to fight it,
aren't we? Ԟ*siiiiigh*
 ▶Elly
That mirror must have been thought to have
the power to "expel" since ancient times.
▶Elly
To ward off evil, in other words.
   ▶Ayase
Y'know, it'd be nice if this subway
monster wasn't too disgusting.
 ▶Ayase
We have to fight THAT thing!? Waaaah...
I don't wanna!
 ▶Reiji
Why don't you think for yourself instead
of relying on others?▶Maki
Isn't this town nice? I think paradise
would be a place like this.
▶Maki
It's an ordinary town, but every day
here is special.
 ▶Nanjo
I've been wondering about that person
Tsutomu mentioned...
▶Nanjo
Don't forget to go to the Alaya Shrine,
<FirstName>.
  ▶Mark
This place is just like our town...
All musty.
  ▶Elly
So this is the Expel Mirror...
It's so fantastically mysterious!
▶Brown
This thing's the Expel Mirror? Huh.
Let's see if it reflects my face...
▶Ayase
So this is the Expel Mirror?
▶Ayase
I wonder if I could get a look at my
face in it. My skin's been all dry...
▶Reiji
So... this is that Expel Mirror.
   > The Expel Mirror has a divine aura
about it...
  ▶Maki
Here it is! This must be the
Expel Mirror!
  ▶Elly
Wh-What in the world...?
▶Ayase
Yeeeek! What IS this!?
 ▶Brown
Woah... what is that!?
 ▶Reiji
......!
What the...!?
  ▶Girl's voice
Don't take this... You shouldn't...
You shouldn't...
▶Nanjo
What was that...!?
▶Nanjo
It looked like a little girl's face,
but she was saying not to take "this."
▶Nanjo
Did she mean the Expel Mirror?
  ▶Mark
Who gives a damn? We gotta have it,
or else.
▶Maki
That face just now... It looked
like Mai...
 ▶Mark
Here, <FirstName>.
▶Mark
We can fight the monster in the subway
once we have this, right?

The stench of the thing...

I'm sorry, <FirstName>, but we haven't
a prayer against this thing at present.
▶Nanjo
Just this once, we'll have to heed
the advice of that dubious young man.
   ▶Yog-Sothoth Jr.
You hold... the Expel Mirror...

But you cannot pass... until you have
defeated me...
   ▶Mark
I knew it was gonna say that!
Let's do this, <FirstName>!
 ▶Elly
If we leave this creature be, it could
grow to be larger than a farmhouse...
▶Elly
We must defeat it now!
  ▶Ayase
Are we really fighting this thing...?
It's so... nasty-looking...
  ▶Brown
What a tasteless creature... And ugh,
that horrible smell! Frickin' gross!

Now's not the time to bitch and moan.

Aww, the monster got beat up.

What a dumb monster! How could it let
them win?
  ▶Maki
Aki...! You're here for more mischief,
aren't you!?
 ▶Aki
Up ahead is where I live. If you go
in there, I'll never let you out!
▶Nanjo
We're still going in, you realize.
We absolutely must defeat Kandori.
  ▶Aki
I won't let you! If you go in there,
I'll trap you inside!
   ▶Mark
You dumb kid... We're not gonna fall
for the same trick twice!
▶Mark
You better start behavin', or we'll
really punish you.
▶Aki
I'm not dumb! Watch, I came up with a
really fun game!
▶Aki
You'll fight a cute girl in it...
Wait and see!
 ▶Aki
Erusaer Tsymmom!
 ▶Maki
That Aki is so full of herself...
I'll give her a good scolding next time!
  ▶Maki
So Chisato was the "cute girl" Aki was
talking about...
 ▶Nanjo
There's something that's been nagging
at me, but...
▶Nanjo
...No. There's no proof. I must be
mistaken.
   ▶Nanjo
The demon that was here before mentioned
its "master"... Did it mean Aki, or...?
   ▶Mark
Alright, let's get back topside and
look for Kandori!
   ▶Mark
Man, here again? Hey, how're we gonna
save Maki if we keep this up?
 ▶Elly
This was the first time I've ever
seen a demon like that.
   ▶Elly
The demon that was here... I felt as
though it was testing our skill.
   ▶Brown
Phew! Glad that monster's gone!
▶Brown
This is one messed-up town...
  ▶Ayase
Sheesh! You won't catch me dead
fighting something like that again!
▶Ayase
The town got all funky and demons
showed up... What the hell happened?
 ▶Reiji
You're not taking the stuff that brat
said seriously, are you?

Kandori to apologize for...▶Agastya Tree

  ▶Elly
It's unpleasant, that's for certain.
▶Ayase
It's so dark... I hate places like
these!
  ▶Brown
Man, what's with the doom and gloom?
This place could use some brightening up!
 ▶Reiji
This stale air... Smells like the windows
here haven't been opened for a month.
▶Pink-afroed man
Heh, looks like we got some fresh faces.
I bet they're clueless...
   ▶Pink-afroed man
...Yesss! A straight!
▶Red-afroed man
We must look sad to you, huh? Yep...
The Harem Queen's our only salvation!
▶Red-afroed man
...Hah! Full house!
   ▶Orange-afroed woman
Teehee... I'm what you'll end up as.
You'll understand sooner or later!
  ▶Afroed drunk
Huhhh...? ԺAre you guysh from outshide?
Pishes me off... ԺI remember now...
▶Afroed drunk
I remember the outshide... ԺWaaaah!
Nrrrrgh... ԺWanna go outshide...
 ▶Master
Now, now, everyone! Let's all toast
each other with our heads held high!
▶Master
We share a fate... What's the use of
this bickering?
▶Master
None so long as we loyally serve our
Harem Queen!
 ▶Pink-afroed man
That dumbstruck look of yours... Been to
see the Queen, huh? Yeah, I can tell.
▶Pink-afroed man
If I was a handsome guy in the Queen's
good books like you...
▶Pink-afroed man
I coulda lived in her palace.
   ▶Orange-afroed woman
...I know how you feel, but you have to
be an adult about this.
▶Orange-afroed woman
Otherwise, you'll never survive this
place.
▶Maki
I wonder what this Harem Queen is like...
   ▶Maki
I... I had no idea...
   ▶Maki
Did you think I was in shock?
▶Maki
Well, I think I can really hit it off
with Chisato now...
  ▶Nanjo
This must be what that brat referred to.
It seems we've been locked in again.
  ▶Nanjo
I admit, I'm somewhat surprised, but
maybe those were Chisato's true feelings.
 ▶Nanjo
So he remains true even after seeing that
side of her? Heh, that's love, I suppose.
▶Mark
Ugh, this sucks. We really have to get
outta here and go after Kandori!
 ▶Mark
Maki... ԺThis must be a real shock
for her.
▶Mark
Yosuke wasn't such a bad guy after all.
 ▶Elly
I think I see now why the atmosphere
here is so oppressive.
 ▶Elly
Do you dislike people such as the Queen,
<FirstName>?
▶Elly
But outwardly pretending to obey while
carping behind one's back...
▶Elly
That's how the people in town are.
▶Elly
Why wouldn't Yosuke despise Chisato now?
▶Elly
Isn't it natural to become disillusioned
after seeing someone's unpleasant side?
▶Elly
I can't believe others would still like
one after showing everything about oneself.
▶Elly
I wonder... Ժif there's someone like that
for me, too...
▶Brown
She's a Queen, huh? Sounds like a real
hottie, don't you think?
▶Brown
Am I right? Man, I can't wait to feast
my eyes!
▶Brown
Y'know... I never thought Chisato was
that kind of girl. What a letdown...
 ▶Brown
A relationship like that... it can run
pretty deep, huh?
   ▶Ayase
I hate this place.
▶Ayase
I feel like it's, like, draining my
powers.
 ▶Ayase
Y'know... Chisato is actually
pretty gutsy!
▶Ayase
I... I want a mirror like that!
I want my own harem!
 ▶Reiji
"Harem Queen"? Heh... funny stuff.
 ▶Reiji
I don't think it's so bad to be honest
about what you want.
▶Reiji
Kind of an absurd outcome... ԺBut it's nice
for things to end that way now and then.
  ▶Afroed drunk
*urrrrp* Yer painting'sh aweshome,
Queen... Can I go home now?
  ▶Afroed drunk
The Queen'sh painting ish no better than
a kid'sh scribble! Servesh her right!
  ▶Downcast woman
A labyrinth of sadness forgotten in the
oubliette of time...
▶Downcast woman
Only alcohol dulls my suffering.
▶Downcast woman
Dammit... that fricking bitch!
▶Downcast woman
She took all the decent-looking men!
▶Downcast woman
I wanna go to the harem too!
▶Downcast woman
Even if the stopped clock starts again...
My suffering continues unabated...
▶Downcast woman
Dammit... that fricking witch!
▶Downcast woman
She went and made a harem when she had
a damn boyfriend all along!
▶Master
No one may leave the market.
▶Master
Such is the decree of the Harem Queen,
this market's mistress.
▶Master
You must make every effort to curry the
Queen's favor.
  ▶Mark
Let's go to the palace. We gotta
hurry, man!
▶Mark
We don't have any time to waste playing
along with this Queen's stupid rules.
   ▶Maki
Masao's right. Let's go meet this Queen!
▶Maki
We can ask her to let us out of here.
   ▶Master
Now that I know I'm free to come and go
as I please... living here isn't so bad.
  ▶Pink-afroed man
You wanna meet the Harem Queen?
▶Pink-afroed man
The entrance is by the casino, but I warn
you: you don't wanna piss her off.
   ▶Pink-afroed man
That junky old mansion in the southeast?
I hear it's connected to another world.
 ▶Red-afroed man
I'll tell you one thing.
▶Red-afroed man
Whatever you do, say nice things about
the Queen's painting. If you don't...
▶Red-afroed man
I guess in the end, the Queen just
had no self-confidence.
▶Red-afroed man
Now that I think about it, I kinda
feel sorry for her.
▶Orange-afroed woman
You're not going to wear moles?
▶Orange-afroed woman
Wearing moles like the Queen's is all
the rage now.
▶Orange-afroed woman
Whew! Goodbye moles, and good riddance!
I didn't look very good with them.▶Maki
It's a beautiful painting. It's just
not really to my tastes...
 ▶Maki
...Chisato...
   ▶Maki
I wonder if this was all for the best.
What do you think, <FirstName>...?
 ▶Nanjo
I don't claim to understand art...
▶Nanjo
But compared to Maki's work, this leaves
me completely cold.
▶Nanjo
So it was Chisato...
▶Nanjo
But how did she set herself up as
mistress of this market?
▶Nanjo
They did their utmost to curry favor with
Chisato, but now that she's gone...
▶Nanjo
Their true hatred for her bubbled quickly
to the surface.
▶Mark
This piece looks good at first glance,
y'know? But that's not enough.
▶Mark
I know it sounds corny, but I think heart
is more important than technique!
▶Mark
This is pretty, but where's the soul?
I'm just not feelin' it.
  ▶Mark
Chisato... What are you doin' on Aki's
side? Why'd you abandon Yosuke...?
   ▶Mark
Maki might not be as crushed as she
looks. At least, I hope she isn't.
  ▶Elly
Well, I like Maki's paintings better!
   ▶Elly
Harem... I believe it means a place
where fine, strapping men are kept.
▶Elly
But doesn't Chisato have a boyfriend?
▶Elly
One never knows what others are saying
behind one's back, don't you think?
  ▶Brown
Paintings are boring. Yeah... this one
especially.
 ▶Brown
Did Chisato always have so many moles?
 ▶Brown
The Chisato we saw a minute ago was
kinda cute...
▶Brown
Kidding! Kidding! It was just a joke!
Man, of all the girls Yosuke coulda had...
 ▶Ayase
So that guy's one of the harem?
What the hell! No fair!
▶Ayase
I think Chisato was suffering, too.
At least try and understand that...
▶Ayase
I wish I had that mirror! I could do
without more freckles, though.
▶Reiji
This Harem Queen must be pretty childish
to decorate a room so tastelessly.
▶Reiji
Putting your faith in something like
friendship makes no sense.
▶Reiji
That stuff's only superficial...
It isn't real.
▶Reiji
Look, we did what we were trying to do,
right? There's no use staying here.
▶Young man
This is the Harem Queen's painting.
Isn't it lovely?
▶Young man
Our Queen is both talented and gorgeous!
Her many moles only enhance her beauty!
▶Young man
She once showed me a painting by someone
she knew, and I retched at the sight!
   ▶Young man
I can't believe she had the gall to
display this worthless piece in public!
▶Young man
And the nerve of her, calling herself
Queen! Ugh!
  > It's the piece the Queen supposedly
painted. You feel like you've seen this
style somewhere...
  ▶Maki
Hey... I know this painting!
It's Chisato's...!
 ▶Mark
What, Chisato Kasai's? I thought they
said she went missing.
▶Mark
Wait... Chisato's painting is here,
and they're saying it's the Queen's...?
 ▶Maki
But why?
▶Maki
Does this mean... Chisato is being held
captive by the Harem Queen?▶Harem Queen
Long time no see, Maki.
▶Harem Queen
Same to <FirstName>, and the rest of
you, too. Welcome to my palace.
 ▶Maki
Ch... Chisato! It really was you...!?
▶Maki
No...!
 ▶Mark
...Knew it.
▶Mark
Yo <FirstName>, did Chisato always have
that many moles?
▶Mark
Didn't she always used to brag about
how clear her skin was?
   ▶Maki
C'mon, Chisato! There's an explanation
for this, right?
▶Maki
Is the real Queen threatening you?
▶Maki
You're not really the enemy... That's a
lie, isn't it?
 ▶Harem Queen
You're such an idiot! Me, being
threatened... utterly ridiculous.
▶Harem Queen
I'm here because I choose to be! Isn't
this palace wonderful?
▶Harem Queen
An angel in black lent me a mirror
that grants my every wish!
▶Harem Queen
All this... from my mirror.
  ▶Mark
An angel in black...
▶Mark
Is that Aki!? Chisato, listen, she's
no angel!
▶Mark
I mean, didn't she kidnap you?
▶Harem Queen
That's what I thought at first.
But that's not how it went.
▶Harem Queen
She was looking for someone who could
use the mirror... It happened to be me.
  ▶Maki
...Okay. So you're the Queen. Isn't it
about time to put an end to this?
▶Maki
Let's go back together! Yosuke's hurt!
▶Maki
He needs you, Chisato...
▶Harem Queen
Yosuke... got hurt...?
   ▶Harem Queen
...Y'know what, Maki? I don't need
Yosuke anymore.
▶Harem Queen
I didn't really like him anyway.
▶Maki
Huh?
▶Maki
What did you just say?
  ▶Harem Queen
I don't like Yosuke. In fact,
I never did.
   ▶Maki
That's a lie! You always bragged about
what a wonderful boyfriend he was...
 ▶Harem Queen
What, you still don't get it? Wow!
You really are stupid!
▶Harem Queen
I started dating Yosuke because I knew
you liked him!
▶Harem Queen
In the beginning, you know, he liked
you better.
▶Harem Queen
And I couldn't allow that...
▶Harem Queen
I mean, I was the pretty one! I'm the
one he should have gone for!
▶Harem Queen
So I made my move, and that feebleminded
moron was powerless to resist.
   ▶Maki
No... Why would you joke like this...?
▶Harem Queen
It's no joke, Maki! It's the truth!
▶Harem Queen
My art was better than yours, and you
got all the attention!
▶Harem Queen
But I hated you even before that! I was
always prettier and more talented!
▶Harem Queen
Why are YOU the one everyone fawns over!?
  ▶Nanjo
So that's why you stole Yosuke... And why
you forced people to praise your artwork.
▶Nanjo
......? ԺWait, Chisato. You should be
aware that this isn't the Maki you know.
▶Harem Queen
Shut up! This has nothing to do with you!
Just stay out of this!
▶Harem Queen
You must've been howling with laughter,
right Maki?
▶Harem Queen
I bet you made fun of me behind my back,
wearing that innocent face of yours!
▶Harem Queen
Well, I won't let you do it to me anymore!
I'm much better than you now!
▶Mark
Sure... Thanks to the power that girl
in black gave you. Right?
   ▶Harem Queen
I said SHUT UP! <FirstName>...
Isn't my painting wonderful?
▶Harem Queen
Everyone says so. They all say it's
much better than Maki's trash!
 ▶Maki
Chisato... you hated me that much?
I never knew...
  ▶Mark
Now I get why your paintings are
so crappy!
▶Mark
You're rotten through and through! A girl
like you could never make real art!
▶Mark
Quit fooling yourself into thinking
you're an artist!
   ▶Harem Queen
...ԞWhat... Ԟdid you say...?
   ▶Nanjo
You were so caught in the throes of envy
over Maki, you never made a real effort.
▶Nanjo
And this is where it brought you...
Forcibly enslaving people.
▶Nanjo
You think this is you at your best?
You're a Queen with no clothes!
▶Nanjo
You're deluding yourself if you think
their praise means anything.
▶Nanjo
They only humor you out of terror!
 ▶Harem Queen
...Me? A Queen with no clothes...?
   ▶Mark
You heard him, Chisato!
▶Mark
I can't stand the way you hurt Maki
because of your stupid complex!
▶Mark
I'll say this as many times as it takes,
so listen up!
▶Mark
Your... paintings... SUCK!
  ▶Harem Queen
I think you need to have another look!
▶Harem Queen
If you can't grasp my artwork, you're
the ones who are wrong!
   ▶Harem Queen
Mirror, mirror, clean and bright.
Get these fools out of my sight!
▶Harem Queen
...Erusaer Tsymmom!▶Master
Oh, my... that was fast.
  ▶Mark
Th... That bitch! She sent us all the
way back here!
▶Maki
I wonder if Chisato really meant what
she said... Maybe she's being controlled?
▶Maki
Hey, yeah! I bet that Aki girl is
controlling her!
   ▶Nanjo
Mm... Chisato's eyes were clear.
▶Nanjo
To me, at least, they didn't seem to be
the eyes of one under someone's control.
  ▶Elly
Why don't we go see her again?
We can ask her everything then.
  ▶Brown
Well, let's go see her again.
  ▶Ayase
Let's go see her one more time. Maybe
she's having regrets by now...?
  ▶Reiji
Well, we won't get anywhere by staying
here. We'll have to go see her again.▶Harem Queen
Ugh, more moles? Not again!
▶Harem Queen
This mirror's great, but I hate how I get
more moles every time I make a wish!
 ▶Mark
Chisato!
▶Harem Queen
Ah, you're back! Well, what did you
think? Weren't my paintings better!?
 ▶Maki
Chisato... Just end this already...
▶Maki
I know now that your paintings are
better. And... and your moles...
  ▶Harem Queen
Shut up! Don't say things you don't
even mean!
▶Harem Queen
You probably think I deserve these moles!
   ▶Harem Queen
But never mind that... I want to show
you something, <FirstName>.
  ▶Maki
My... My painting...!
   ▶Harem Queen
Alright, <FirstName>. You saw my
paintings in the gallery, right?
▶Harem Queen
Which did you like more? My masterpieces,
or Maki's filth smeared on a canvas?
 ▶Mark
Maki's painting is a million damn
times better than yours!
  ▶Harem Queen
I don't think I asked you, monkey!
   ▶Harem Queen
Mirror where my face is shown...
▶Harem Queen
Turn these monkeys into stone!
Erusaer Tsymmom!
 ▶Mark
Whoa!
   ▶Nanjo
Ngh!
   ▶Elly
Eek!
▶Brown
Yikes!
 ▶Ayase
Noooo!
 ▶Reiji
......!
▶Maki
Stop it, Chisato!
   ▶Harem Queen
Aaahahahahaha! Turn to stone,
all of you! ՋAck...!
  ▶Harem Queen
Dammit! Even more moles!
▶Harem Queen
Turning them to stone was too nice...
I should've made them suffer more!
  ▶Harem Queen
I'll give you, and only you, one last
chance, <FirstName>...
▶Harem Queen
Which is better? My breathtaking
painting, or Maki's piece?
 ▶Harem Queen
And I want an honest answer!ԟ
   ▶Mark
You moron! You actually think that!?
▶Harem Queen
Hahaha... Aaahahahaha!
▶Harem Queen
Well, Maki? What now!? He chose mine!
   ▶Maki
............
  ▶Nanjo
Fortunately, we weren't turned all
the way...
  ▶Aki
Ooohhh! Queeeeen! What're you doing!?
I told you to beat these guys up!
  ▶Harem Queen
I'm sorry, Miss Angel. I just didn't
want any more moles...
  ▶Aki
Well... how about this? Beat them,
and I'll put your face back to normal!
▶Harem Queen
Really!?
▶Harem Queen
All right... I'll do it!
  ▶Harem Queen
I'm sorry, <FirstName>. I was actually
fond of you...
  ▶Harem Queen
Mirror, mirror, now's the hour:
Give to me your strongest power!
▶Harem Queen
Erusaer Tsymmom!
  ▶Mark
Hah! How do you like that? This guy
ain't a coward you can bully around!
▶Mark
Ngh...!
 ▶Harem Queen
I thought you would understand,
<FirstName>, but I guess I was wrong.
▶Harem Queen
I'll return this humiliation tenfold...
You can turn to stone like the rest!
   ▶Aki
Yeesh, you're still at it?
▶Aki
Hey Queen, if you beat these guys up,
I'll fix your face back to normal!
▶Harem Queen
If that's what Miss Angel wants,
then the plan has changed.
▶Harem Queen
I'll kill you all myself!
  ▶Yosuke
Chisato, you dummy... You should trust
me more.
   ▶Chisato
I-I was afraid, Yosuke...
▶Chisato
I didn't know what I'd do if you
stopped liking me.
  ▶Yosuke
Haha! Come on... As if I'd ever stop
liking you.
▶Yosuke
Now drop that sad face and give me
a smile, okay Chi-Chi?
   ▶Mark
"Chi-Chi"...? ԺI think we're in the way
here... Let's go back, <FirstName>.▶Maki
Chisato had her own problems... I feel
a little better now, kind of.
▶Nanjo
What a blunder! To allow myself to be
petrified at a critical moment...!
   ▶Nanjo
They seem to have reconciled. Well, if
that's what they want, leave them be.
   ▶Mark
You guys didn't talk about any important
stuff, did you? Damn, now I'm curious!
 ▶Mark
Don't think I'm happy about all this!
Even if she isn't our Maki...
▶Mark
I'm not so pathetic that it cheers me up
to see her brokenhearted.
   ▶Elly
Didn't Maki like Yosuke?
▶Elly
Even if you show your true self, there are
those who'll accept you, warts and all...
▶Brown
Does Chisato seem different now to you?
It's like... she softened up, kinda.
   ▶Brown
Heheh, I wrote down the lines Yosuke
used. Now, who should I try them on...?
   ▶Ayase
Hey, so like, what happened while I was
a human statue!?
   ▶Ayase
Wh-What!? I'm not crying!
▶Reiji
...I have nothing to say.
▶Young men
Um, could you please put us back to
normal now...?
 ▶Yosuke
I'm sorry I was the cause of so much
trouble for everyone.
▶Yosuke
If I'd been a little more reliable,
this wouldn't have happened.
▶Yosuke
Sorry, guys.
▶Chisato
...The real Maki is trapped inside
the hospital.
▶Chisato
Is it right for me to be so blessed
while Maki suffers...?
> It's Maki's painting...
 > The mirror's power has faded...
 ▶Aki
Hey! How weak are you, losing to nobodies
like them!?
▶Aki
If you can't win, I'm not gonna fix
your face!
▶Aki
Though I was never gonna do that anyway!
Pbbbbt!
▶Chisato
Huh? Hey, wait... What do you mean!?
 ▶Aki
Daddy called you a "ginnee pig" and a
"useless pon"!
▶Aki
He said, "Even if Chisato loses, she's
not worth our trouble."
▶Aki
So you can have fun staying that way as
long as you live! Bye-bye!
   ▶Aki
Erusaer Tsymmom!
 ▶Chisato
W-Wait! Am I going to be like this
forever...!? No...!
   ▶Maki
Chisato...! Just wait here for us.
We'll go catch that girl.
▶Maki
And when we do, we'll make her put your
face back the way it was!
   ▶Chisato
Maki...
▶Chisato
You're lying! Don't feed me that crap!
I know you think I deserve all this!
▶Maki
I'm not lying, Chisato. I still like
you... even now.
   ▶Chisato
You... like me...?
   ▶Maki
Yep! You're energetic, beautiful,
fashionable, and self-possessed.
▶Maki
I can tell what Yosuke sees in you.
   ▶Chisato
No! I'm... sure Yosuke still has a
thing for you, Maki.
▶Chisato
...I'm sorry.
▶Chisato
I was so jealous of you, Maki.
▶Chisato
You say I'm self-possessed, but it's
just an act.
▶Chisato
The real me is helpless.
▶Chisato
I have to act out and look pretty or
everyone will ignore me...
▶Chisato
That's why I envied you. You just had to
be yourself, and everyone loved you.
▶Maki
Chisato...
  ▶Chisato
Yosuke will hate me now. Then, you and
him will...
▶Chisato
...Yosuke...
▶Maki
Ohhhh, you're so stubborn! Deep down,
you really like Yosuke.
▶Maki
But you don't have to worry about me
getting in the way. See...
▶Chisato
Ack! What the...?
▶Yosuke
Chisato! I finally found you! I've been
looking for you all this time!
▶Yosuke
...What happened to your face!?
Did you get hurt!?
▶Chisato
No! Don't look at me!
▶Maki
Umm, what happened was, Aki put a curse
on her, and...
  ▶Chisato
Maki! Are you trying to cover for me?
▶Chisato
No... Not this time!
 ▶Chisato
Look, Yosuke! This is my face now!
▶Chisato
I did terrible things... I was so cruel
to Maki.
▶Chisato
This is my punishment!
   ▶Yosuke
Chisato...!
   ▶Chisato
I don't deserve you, Yosuke!
▶Chisato
I'm a terrible person... Even the face
I was so proud of shows it.
▶Chisato
If people see you with me, they'll
laugh at you, too.
▶Chisato
That's why it's okay if you want Maki
instead! You always liked her, right?
  ▶Yosuke
Hey, hey, don't get me wrong!
▶Yosuke
Yeah, I did like Maki... But that was
in the past. I like you now, Chisato!
▶Yosuke
Argh, listen to me...! This is so
embarrassing! C'mon, let's go.
  ▶Chisato
But... these moles will never come off,
you know...
▶Chisato
You don't care if your friends laugh
at us...?
 ▶Yosuke
Let 'em laugh! See if I care!
▶Yosuke
You said you're a bad person? Well, I'm
no saint, either. Don't worry about it.
▶Yosuke
Just be honest with me, like you were
a second ago.
▶Yosuke
I'm your boyfriend, Chisato...
▶Yosuke
I don't care what you look like, as long
as you're you.
▶Yosuke
I love you, Chisato!
▶Maki
Oh! The mirror...!
  ▶Yosuke
Chisato! Your face... it's back
to normal!
▶Chisato
You're right! This is wonderful...
▶Chisato
And I'm not talking about my face.
▶Chisato
I... always thought you still liked
Maki, Yosuke.
▶Chisato
Thanks...
  ▶Mark
Ugh, I think I have a cramp.
▶Mark
Whoa! Yosuke!? Hey... did your moles
fall off, Chisato?
 ▶Nanjo
Hrm... It seems things moved quickly
while I wasn't watching.
  ▶Elly
What happened? Why is Yosuke here?
  ▶Brown
Huh--Yosuke!? What're you doing here?
▶Brown
Whoa, and Chisato's moles are gone!
  ▶Ayase
When did Yosuke get here?
▶Ayase
And when did Chisato get back to normal!?
Geez... You guys lost me!
  ▶Reiji
Yosuke...?
▶Reiji
Hm. I see Chisato's back to normal, too.
▶Chisato
I'm sorry, Maki... I was the one lying.
▶Chisato
Like you said, deep down, I like Yosuke.
▶Chisato
I'd hope you could forgive me...
▶Chisato
But I doubt it. I did want us to be
friends again, though...
 ▶Maki
Oh, come on! What's to forgive?
▶Maki
You're still my best friend, Chisato.
I'm really happy for you!
  ▶Nanjo
It seems Aki escaped...
▶Nanjo
Chisato, do you know anything about a man
named Kandori? He's in league with Aki.
  ▶Chisato
I don't know anyone named Kandori...
▶Chisato
But you know, that girl said that she
lives in a castle.
  ▶Mark
A castle? Say what!?
▶Nanjo
It's not all that surprising.
▶Nanjo
Though still a child, Aki's powers are
immense. Making a castle would be easy.
   ▶Maki
Alright, then that's our next goal.
Let's find that castle!
 ▶Yosuke
Oh, I forgot to tell you, Chisato, but
that Maki isn't the Maki we know.
  ▶Chisato
Huh?▶Agastya Tree
Young ones... Your presence is welcome.

So this is your hideout! It's the
end of the line for you!
  ▶Aki
Pbbbbbt! You can't get in from here!
▶Aki
If the one in the forest was here, yeah,
but she's too much of a scaredy cat.
▶Aki
That's how come no one can stop me
and my Daddy!
  ▶Maki
Hey!
▶Maki
Ugh! Sheesh... she got away again.
  ▶Nanjo
......
 ▶Mark
Damn... it won't even budge.
▶Mark
Hey Nanjo, quit starin' into space!
Don't you have a plan or somethin'?
 ▶Nanjo
The girl placed something onto that
pedestal.
  ▶Nanjo
We won't gain access without a key
fitting this half-moon-shaped hollow.
   ▶Elly
Judging by what she said, someone
else must have it.
▶Brown
Urgh, another doohickey hunt?
  ▶Ayase
Hey, open up right now!
▶Maki
The forest... it must be the one on the
west side. It was a flower garden once...
▶Maki
But now they call it the |ԏLost Forest| .
  ▶Elly
Then let's go back. We need to find
whoever has that key.
   ▶Brown
Uuugh... we have to go back?
▶Brown
How about having the leader stay here
to keep watch? No? Alright, fine...
 ▶Ayase
What!? We came all this way... and now
we're going BACK!? This is the worst!
   ▶Mark
Oh well. Guess we'll go back... We gotta
find whoever that brat was talking about.
  ▶Maki
When the Lost Forest was a flower garden,
a girl named Mai used to play there...
▶Maki
Is she the one we're looking for?
   ▶Mark
That brat HAS to be Kandori's kid.
She sure takes after him...
  ▶Nanjo
<FirstName>... doesn't that child's
behavior trouble you somewhat?
▶Nanjo
I can't quite shake the feeling that
we're being manipulated.
 ▶Elly
Kandori must be very precious to that
girl... I'm slightly jealous.
▶Elly
Oh, I'm sorry if that came off as
strange.
   ▶Brown
Alright, I'll go back with you. I mean,
what would you do without a leader?
▶Ayase
Hey <FirstName>, gimme a piggyback
ride to the other side!
▶Ayase
C'mon, you'd get to feel me warm on your
back all the way there. Pretty please?
   ▶Reiji
The bastard's up there, eh? I won't let
him escape... He better be ready to die.
   ▶Reiji
You better get out of the way.
I'm going to destroy it.
▶Mark
Whoa there, Reiji. This isn't something
you can just smash like that.
▶Mark
You sure lose it when Kandori's involved.
Well, I'm not gonna ask...
▶Mark
But man, you don't have to carry whatever
it is all by yourself.
   ▶Reiji
......
 ▶Maki
Masao's right, Reiji. We're all in
this together, after all.
▶Reiji
...I have no reason to play nice. "All in
this together"? You disgust me.
▶Reiji
And you, Masao? You disgust me most
of all.
  ▶Maki
Reiji! That's not nice!
 ▶Mark
It's cool, Maki.
▶Mark
Get disgusted or don't, dude, but we
have to go back together for now.
▶Mark
'Cause we're all after the same thing.
C'mon, <FirstName>, let's go.
▶Maki
Boys are so complicated. Masao's getting
along with Reiji... I think.
   ▶Mark
Huh? Am I feeling okay? What are you
talking about...?
  ▶Nanjo
I'm surprised he stood there and took
that from Masao. Heh...
▶Nanjo
He must sense another like himself.
Feral beasts can do that, I suppose.
 > The door is tightly closed.
 > There's a depression shaped like
a half-moon.▶Maki
Until last month, this place was a
beautiful garden of flowers.
 ▶Maki
Oh, sorry, I was lost in thought for a
minute... Let's get to the castle!
   ▶Mark
In our world, this was a police station.
▶Mark
C'mon, we should get back to that
weird castle.
 ▶Nanjo
This world must have amazing security
prior to this incident.
▶Nanjo
The police simply don't exist here.
  ▶Nanjo
Sorry... I need some time alone
to think.
  ▶Reiji
...You don't need to talk to me.
Hurry and go.
 ▶Reiji
...We have no business being here
anymore. Let's hurry and go.
 ▶Elly
What a lonely forest...
 ▶Elly
You're not hurt, are you, <FirstName>?
Hm? Why do I ask...?
▶Elly
No particular reason... Why? Did it
seem like an odd question?
 ▶Brown
This place seems pretty dangerous.
 ▶Brown
That girl asked some pretty heavy stuff.
I'm still kinda sorting it all out.
   ▶Ayase
It's been a while since I saw this many
trees in one place.
▶Ayase
Did you know this smell is called ozone?
   ▶Ayase
...Hey <FirstName>, have you ever like,
thought seriously about your future?
▶Ayase
I've... Eh, never mind. Let's not talk
about that stuff... Just forget it.▶Girl in white
Wh-Who's there?
▶Mark
Hey, isn't that the ghost who showed up
at the Historical Society?
▶Mark
Is she friends with that brat in black!?
  ▶Girl in white
W...
   ▶Girl in white
Waaaaaaaaah!
   ▶Maki
Hey now, don't cry. Are you little Mai?
 ▶Girl in white
*sniffle* Yes...
   ▶Maki
Whoa...! She has a half-moon-shaped
compact!
▶Maki
It looks a lot like mine...
 ▶Nanjo
That must be the castle's key. But who
are these children...?
  ▶Maki
Hey Mai, you know that girl Aki?
▶Maki
Is she a friend of yours?
   ▶Mai
No! She's not my friend!
▶Mai
She's Mai...
▶Mai
She's the bad Mai. Waaaaaah...!
▶Maki
What!? What does that mean?
 ▶Mai
*sniffle* I was lonely... That's when
Kandori came.
▶Mai
Then she came out of me and left with
Kandori.
▶Mai
She knows Kandori isn't our real Daddy...
 ▶Nanjo
Hm... So she's a separate personality
that split off... What is that compact?
  ▶Mai
It's my treasure. It grants wishes.
▶Mai
I used it to make this town.
   ▶Maki
No way! That's...
   ▶Elly
Unbelievable... This small child was the
creator of an entire world...?
 ▶Nanjo
Yes. This little girl was this world's
creator.
▶Brown
Wow! You're like a magical girl. I could
use one of those compacts myself!
 ▶Ayase
Seriously!? Can I have that!?
  ▶Maki
Can't you use the compact to catch Aki
and Kandori, or send everyone home?
  ▶Mai
No... Aki took half of it.
▶Mai
I know she's using the other half to
do mean things...
▶Mai
My wishes just get canceled out. That's
how come I'm hiding here.
  ▶Mark
But we can't get to Kandori without it.
Can't we borrow it for a while?
 ▶Mai
No! You can't! That's what Kandori wants!
▶Maki
Mai... You shouldn't hide like this.
▶Mai
Waaah... *sniffle* Why not...?
   ▶Mai
Won't I be safe if I hide here?Ԗ
▶Maki
<FirstName> is right.
▶Maki
Hiding from your problems won't solve
them. You have to meet them head on!
   ▶Maki
Look, <FirstName>, this isn't the time
for jokes!
▶Maki
Hiding from your problems won't solve
them. You have to meet them head on!
   ▶Mai
*sniffle* Why...?
▶Mai
Why are you all trying so hard?ԗ
▶Mark
Gaaaah! We don't have time for this
philosophical crap!
▶Mark
We gotta get back to our world and
save someone.
▶Mark
C'mon, please let us borrow that thing!
From the looks of it, she's...
   ▶Mai
She's... already dead?
   ▶Mark
H-Hell no! She's alive for sure!
Look, anyway...
▶Mai
What are you all living for? Isn't...
Isn't it painful?
  ▶Maki
What...?
▶Mark
Uh...
   ▶Nanjo
......
 ▶Elly
Why...?
 ▶Brown
...That's one heavy question.
  ▶Ayase
What a yucky girl.
 ▶Reiji
......
 ▶Mai
What about you, mister?
  ▶Mai
What are you living for?Ԙ
   ▶Elly
I agree. It's just as <FirstName> says.
▶Elly
Life isn't all pain. There are joys to
be had during one's life, too.
  ▶Brown
Yeah, that's right! Listen to this guy.
▶Brown
There's fun stuff in life, if you look
for it.
 ▶Ayase
Yeah... <FirstName> is prolly right.
▶Ayase
Life can be fun, y'know!
▶Elly
I haven't thought about things like this
in a while,but it's true, life can be fun.
 ▶Brown
I don't usually think about this stuff...
But yeah, life is good sometimes.
▶Ayase
It's been a while since I thought about
that kinda stuff, but life's pretty good!
  ▶Nanjo
<FirstName> is right. There is sweetness
in life.
▶Reiji
What a strange kid... It's a tough
question, but life isn't so bad.
▶Maki
...<FirstName>... Is that really what
you meant to say to Mai?Ԭ
  ▶Maki
...Okay. Then answer her again, for real
this time.
 ▶Mai
Okay... Then I'm going to stay here.
You can't have my compact.
▶Mai
I'm sorry.
 ▶Mark
This is going nowhere... We're begging
you here! Please let us borrow it!
   ▶Mark
If you won't, I'm gonna have to give
you a spanking, got it?
▶Mai
Waaaah! No! I don't want that!
Erusaer Tsymmom!
  ▶Mai
Help me, Mr. Bear!
   ▶Mai
Okay... Just for you... I'll let you
borrow my compact.
  ▶Mark
Sweet! Thanks, Mai!
▶Mark
Let's wish right now for it to send us
to Kandori!
   ▶Elly
Thank you! Let's wish right away for it
to take us to Kandori.
  ▶Brown
Woohoo! Alright, what should my first
wish be?
 ▶Ayase
Now you're talking! So like, what should
I wish for first?
 ▶Nanjo
Now's not the time for selfishness, you
simpleton. Have it take us to Kandori.
 ▶Mai
You can't. Only I can use it.
▶Mai
And the castle is Aki's home, so my
wishes won't work on it.
 ▶Mark
Ugh... I knew it seemed too good to
be true.
▶Mark
Oh well, let's hoof it back to the
castle, then.
▶Brown
Awww... I had a bunch of wishes.
   ▶Ayase
What!? But I had so many wishes...
This sucks!
 ▶Maki
Can I see that compact, <FirstName>?
▶Maki
Wow... It's only half of the whole thing,
but it's the same as mine.
▶Maki
Though mine doesn't have a mirror like
this one.
  ▶Mark
Well, wishes are supposed to be things
you grant for yourself, after all.
▶Mark
It would be boring if everything all
went the way you wanted it to.
▶Nanjo
Kandori... How does acquiring that
compact play into his schemes...?
   ▶Reiji
...That was one hell of an answer.
 ▶Elly
When I was little, I pretended the mirror
in my house was magic.
▶Elly
I'd make wishes to it, too, like to
become a beautiful girl everyone loved...
   ▶Brown
Man, this bites. I had a ton of wishes
all lined up.
   ▶Ayase
Aww, but I wanted so much stuff! You'll
buy them for me, right, <FirstName>?
 ▶Mai
Please make sure Kandori doesn't get
this compact.
   > It's locked.
> Obtained Ẅ♀|ԍCompact Half| .▶Mai
Nooo! Mr. Bear! He's dead...
▶Mai
Waaaaaaaaaah! Now no one will be
my friend!
▶Mai
You're so mean...
   ▶Maki
She disappeared... I feel like we did
something bad to her.
 ▶Nanjo
Indeed... Why did you go and threaten
her, Masao!?
▶Nanjo
Now we've lost a valuable source of
information.
▶Elly
That bear... It must have been her only
friend. And we...
   ▶Brown
No wonder she's a magical girl.
That was a close call...
▶Brown
Still, I feel kinda bad for her.
  ▶Ayase
Sheesh! It's 'cause you had to go and
shoot your mouth off, Masao!
 ▶Mark
Well, what was I supposed to do!?
I didn't think it would go this far...
▶Nanjo
Hm? What's that on the floor?
  ▶Maki
Whoa! It's Mai's compact!
   ▶Mark
Huh... She must've dropped it. It feels
kinda wrong, but we should borrow it.
   ▶Maki
It grants any wish, right? Why don't
we have it send us to the castle?
  ▶Nanjo
Good idea. Give it a try, Masao.
   ▶Mark
Okay. How'd it go...? Erusaer Tsymmom.
  ▶Maki
...Nothing happened.
▶Nanjo
There's always a catch... That child
must be the only one who can use it.
  ▶Mark
Oh well, we'll just have to hoof it
back to the castle.
 ▶Maki
Can I see that compact, <FirstName>?
▶Maki
Wow... It's only half of the whole thing,
but it's the same as mine.
▶Maki
Though mine doesn't have a mirror like
this one.
  ▶Mark
Well, wishes are supposed to be things

went the way you wanted it to.

Kandori... What's he scheming to do
by acquiring that compact...?

Alright, <FirstName>.

Let's try fitting that compact half
into the pedestal.
   ▶Nanjo
Wait a second, <FirstName>...
▶Maki
'Sup, Nanjo?
▶Nanjo
...It's nothing. Carry on.
 ▶Mark
Man, you've always been weird, but it's
really ramped up lately.
▶Mark
You've been acting funny for a while now.
   ▶Nanjo
...Don't worry about it.
   ▶Mark
Heh! You heard him, <FirstName>.
Go right ahead.
  ▶Maki
Kandori and Aki are up there...
We're getting close, <FirstName>.
 ▶Maki
Now what do we do!? We have to get
Mai's compact back!
  ▶Mark
Hurry up, man. Just put that compact
into the pedestal.
 ▶Mark
Dammit! We fell right for their trap!
   ▶Nanjo
This is dirty pool, Kandori...
 ▶Nanjo
We had no choice but to dance according
to his tune.
▶Nanjo
A dirty trick, but one well played.
   ▶Reiji
Kandori's not going anywhere. He'll get
what's coming to him in the end.
   ▶Reiji
He's a devil, just like his father...
  ▶Elly
I'm very uneasy about this... Be careful,
<FirstName>.
▶Elly
I thought as much... But I'm glad nothing
happened to you, <FirstName>.
   ▶Brown
Careful, <Nickname>. We don't want
anything to--
▶Brown
What, you want me to do it for you?
▶Brown
That was... I... What was that!? Oh my
God, I am so pissed off right now!
  ▶Ayase
Hurry it up, <FirstName>.
▶Ayase
That was so cheap! Using people like
that... Oh, he pisses me off so bad!
  > Place the Compact Half? 
   ▶Mark
Wh-What just happened?
  ▶Nanjo
I'm sure Kandori is laughing himself
hoarse right now.
 ▶Maki
What do you mean?
   ▶Nanjo
Kandori wanted that compact.
▶Nanjo
Since Mai wouldn't come out, he needed
someone to get it and bring it to him.
▶Nanjo
We were his patsies.
▶Mark
What?
▶Mark
That scumbag! Wait, if you knew,
why didn't you tell us!?
  ▶Nanjo
Because it's still the only way to
get to him.
 ▶Maki
Why, though?
▶Maki
If he just needed the compact,
why would he let us in?
  ▶Nanjo
He's inviting us in. He has a rather
high opinion of himself...
▶Mark
I hate looking like an idiot...
▶Mark
Fine, then! We'll play along! Let's go,
<FirstName>!
   > The door is tightly closed.
 ▶Maki
The haunted mansion, huh? I remember
sneaking in there when I was a kid...
▶Maki
Wait... huh...? Who was it that used
to yell at me for doing that...?
▶Mark
Kind of a surprise to hear Reiji is
that bastard's half-brother.
▶Mark
But now that I think about it, they do
kinda have similar eyes.
  ▶Mark
Reiji must be pretty pissed.
▶Nanjo
...No, that's not it. But if I think of
it another way... No, wait...
▶Nanjo
Hm? Sorry, but I'm busy now.
 ▶Elly
Let's be on our way to the haunted
mansion, <FirstName>!
  ▶Brown
The haunted mansion's south of here,
right?
▶Ayase
Hurry! We don't have time to lose!
The haunted mansion is to the south.

You think this is the time for a chat!?

I-It's Reiji!
   ▶Mark
Yo, Reiji! Hang in there!
   ▶Reiji
...Ngh... Dammit...
▶Kandori
Hmh. Youth oft destroys itself...
A common failing of headstrong boys.
   ▶Mark
You bastard...
  ▶Nanjo
Kandori... We meet again.
  ▶Mark
You've messed with us for the last time.
▶Maki
Aki! He's not your Daddy. Don't you
know that!?
 ▶Elly
Looks like this is it, Mr. Kandori.
 ▶Brown
You low-down, dirty coward! I'll shove
your dirty tricks down your throat!
 ▶Ayase
Hey, give us that compact back!
I need it for... uh... stuff!
  ▶Aki
Pbbbbbt! You can't hurt Daddy!
   ▶Kandori
It seems you've endured unspeakable
hardships, all for vengeance's sake.
 ▶Maki
Where's the compact? Give it back!
  ▶Aki
It's right here!
 ▶Kandori
The two compacts reunite in my hands...
I have you to thank, young man.
  ▶Nanjo
You snake... What's your plan for
the compact!?
▶Kandori
Show them, Aki.
  ▶Aki
Okay, Daddy! Erusaer Tsymmom!
▶Maki
What is this...? A mirror!?
 ▶Kandori
It's my ambition given shape...
Now witness its power!
   ▶Reiji
Takahisa Kandori... You're going nowhere!
  ▶Kandori
Don't be so coarse with your brother's
name. Watch your tongue...
▶Kandori
You may be the child of Father's mistress,
but Kandori blood flows in you.
▶Kandori
...But what's the use? A stray bitch
will breed stray dogs.
 ▶Mark
Reiji...? You're that slimebag's
brother!?
  ▶Reiji
Shut up! My name's Kido! Reiji Kido!
▶Reiji
This is for my mother--the woman your dad
used and threw away like a dirty rag!
▶Reiji
This wound will never forget!
 ▶Kandori
Hmph... Nonsense. Take your grievance up
with my father's grave.
 ▶Reiji
Kandori!
   ▶Kandori
What a bothersome dog...
Muzzle him, Aki.
▶Mark
Reiji!
  ▶Mark
You've messed with us one too many
times!
   ▶Maki
Is that Mai's compact!?
 ▶Maki
Aki! He's not your Daddy. Don't you
know that!?
▶Maki
Give that compact back!▶Mark
Wh... What is that...? Don't tell me
that's our town...
 ▶Kandori
That's right.
▶Kandori
It's my new castle... I call it
Deva Yuga.
▶Kandori
A worthy name for something that will
usher in a new, shining era...
▶Elly
Oh my God...
▶Brown
*gulp* The whole town disappeared...
   ▶Ayase
No way... Did all those people die...!?
▶Reiji
Ngh... You little...!
  ▶Nanjo
Kandori, you devil...
  ▶Maki
I can't believe you did that...
 ▶Kandori
Heh... Hahahaha! This Mirror of Chaos
is just what I've yearned for!
▶Kandori
How exquisite... It's no mere compact.
You've all seen its majestic power!
▶Kandori
I've acquired the power to make my
desires reality...
▶Kandori
Power over the dimensions without need
for the Deva System!
  ▶Nanjo
Yes... I'm starting to see now.
▶Nanjo
The compacts and the Deva System were
only laying the groundwork.
▶Nanjo
Now...
   ▶Kandori
I will become a god on Earth. And a god
has only one duty...
▶Kandori
To wield the rod of judgement upon the
wayward human race!
▶Maki
I get it... You're planning on
annihilating humanity...
 ▶Mark
Like hell!
  ▶Nanjo
I won't allow it, Kandori!
 ▶Kandori
Such senseless defiance...
   ▶Maki
Masao! Kei!
 ▶Kandori
I'll now return to the real world.
▶Kandori
Do you despise me? If so, then follow
me there... after defeating this!
 ▶Nanjo
Ngh...
 ▶Mark
Y-You son of a...
   ▶Kandori
Objects of one's desire cannot be
easily obtained.
▶Kandori
But the joy of overcoming obstacles to
obtain them is the highest bliss...
▶Kandori
So speaks your new god!
▶Maki
Wait!
   ▶Saurva
It is showtime! I'll make you dance...
A dance of death!▶Mark
Yo Reiji! You still alive!?
 ▶Reiji
Ngh... Where is he...?
 ▶Mark
You dummy... We told you, you couldn't
do it alone. He went back to our world.
  ▶Reiji
Then what are you waiting for!?
Hurry after him!
   ▶Elly
But how...? We haven't any means of
returning to our world!
 ▶Brown
We can't! How the hell do we beat a
guy with that kind of power?
▶Brown
Never mind that, how do we even get
back to our world!?
   ▶Ayase
Just like that, huh? How do you suggest
we get back, call a cab!?
▶Ayase
And even if we do... There's nothing we
can do against him now! It's all over...
 ▶Reiji
There must be a way! That's the kind of
bastard he is! He's still toying with us.
  ▶Nanjo
Reiji's right. There must be some way...
Heh. For once, we're in agreement.
▶Reiji
...Yeah.
   ▶Maki
Maybe there... The place where there were
rumors of people being spirited away.
 ▶Mark
The |ԏhaunted mansion| !
▶Mark
I used to sneak in there all the time
when I was a kid. Ma would get so mad...
  ▶Nanjo
It's in the same place here as SEBEC is
in our world... It's certainly possible.
   ▶Elly
But this is madness! We have no proof
it's even possible!
▶Elly
And once we get there... how are we
meant to fight Kandori as he is now!?
  ▶Brown
Oh, give it up already! Some things are
impossible no matter how hard you try!
▶Brown
We've been wasting our time from
the start...
   ▶Ayase
Shyeah, right! It's impossible! Why am
I even bothering with this!?
▶Maki
You can't give up! Isn't this about
your world? Your future?
▶Maki
Are you just going to let someone
walk all over it?
▶Maki
You're fine with throwing it all away?
▶Maki
Well, I'm not!
▶Maki
I like this town! I like all of you!
I like... me!
▶Maki
And I can't just stay quiet and watch
the things I like be destroyed!
▶Maki
It's just not something I would do!
   ▶Elly
...You're right, Maki. Staying here and
whimpering won't solve the matter.
▶Elly
Let's go and protect the things we love!
  ▶Brown
...Alright! Your leader's back in action!
▶Brown
The worse the bad guy, the stronger the
hero looks! Let's go!
▶Ayase
...Well, I guess I'll do this. Like, my
future's at stake here, too.
▶Ayase
So let's go to the haunted mansion!
   ▶Mark
The things we like, huh...? Looks like
no one has any more complaints.
▶Mark
Let's get to the haunted mansion ASAP,
<FirstName>!
 ▶Mark
Dammit! What a waste of time...
▶Mark
If we don't hurry and catch that scumbag,
things are gonna get out of hand!
  ▶Reiji
There must be a way! That's the kind of
bastard he is! He's still toying with us.
▶Reiji
I'm not giving up until my hands are
around that bastard's neck!
 ▶Mark
Maki... It's our world's problem now.
You can go back home.
 ▶Maki
No! I'm not going to be the only one
who has to sit back and watch!
▶Maki
I like this town! I like all of you!
I like... me!
▶Maki
And I can't just stay quiet and watch
the things I like be destroyed!
▶Maki
It's just not something I would do!
   ▶Nanjo
Heh... "In the lexicon of youth, there is
no such word as 'fail.'"
▶Nanjo
It may be a cheesy quote, but I think
I'll take a shot at believing it.
 ▶Reiji
Will you hurry up and go!? I can take
care of myself!
  ▶Reiji
I'm Reiji Kido, dammit!
▶Maki
I didn't think the compact let you do
that much...
  ▶Mark
Don't worry, Reiji. We'll come back
for you.
▶Mark
You all right, Reiji?
   ▶Reiji
...Worry about yourself first.
 ▶Mark
Heh! That was nothin'. No way I'm
goin' down before you do.
 ▶Reiji
You got one hell of a mouth...
Better not forget those words.
  ▶Mark
You know it.
▶Mark
Looks like Reiji's finally starting to
come out of his shell.
   ▶Elly
We shouldn't be so quick to complain.
   ▶Brown
We can't always be running off with our
tails between our legs.
▶Ayase
She's right.
▶Ayase
If we don't do anything, like, my future
boyfriend's gonna die too, huh?▶Agastya Tree
Young ones... Your presence is welcome.
 ▶Agastya Tree
Will you inscribe your story on me? 
   ▶Agastya Tree
Take care on your journey, young ones...▶Mark
Tch... So it was a trap after all!
Let's do this, <FirstName>!
▶Hariti
Maki...?
▶Hariti
Oh, Maki, I finally found you.
You're safe...
   ▶Nanjo
That voice... There's no mistaking it.
It's Maki's mother...!
  ▶Hariti
I've been looking for you all this
time... Please come to me, Maki.
   ▶Elly
Maki! It's no use... It seems that
the demon is controlling her...
▶Elly
I know the voice is unquestionably
Maki's mother's...
▶Elly
But you can't trust that! Let's get the
first strike, <FirstName>!
 ▶Brown
Dude, <Nickname>, what do we do!?
▶Brown
That demon's gonna kill Maki! We gotta
defeat it, now!
▶Ayase
Well, what's it gonna be, <FirstName>!?
▶Ayase
That monster could kill Maki! Let's get
it already!
  ▶Reiji
Is it right to leave Maki be, <FirstName>?
We should destroy that demon!
 ▶Mark
But that voice... That's Maki's mom,
I'm dead sure...
▶Mark
Isn't it?
▶Mark
I don't know why she'd look like that,
but what if it really is her mom...?
▶Mark
Put your weapon away, <FirstName>!
   ▶Nanjo
......
 > What will you do?Ԛ
 ▶Hariti
Why are you getting in my way? Give me
back my daughter!
  ▶Setsuko Sonomura
Ngh... This isn't... the infirmary...?
▶Setsuko Sonomura
Oh, it's the haunted mansion. I was just
having a dream about this place...
   ▶Mark
See? Maki's mom doesn't exist in this
world, so...
▶Mark
This has to be her! But what's she
doing here...?
▶Mark
You okay, lady?
  ▶Setsuko Sonomura
Yes... I'm all right...
▶Setsuko Sonomura
Maki used to get lost at this haunted
mansion often when she was little...
▶Setsuko Sonomura
I'm used to looking for her here.
▶Setsuko Sonomura
I was just dreaming about those days...
▶Setsuko Sonomura
I was searching for her in this huge
mansion, and I heard Maki call to me...
▶Setsuko Sonomura
I don't remember anything after that.
  ▶Maki
Um, Miss? I'm... not your real child
after all...
   ▶Setsuko Sonomura
What...?
▶Nanjo
Allow me to explain.
   ▶Setsuko Sonomura
So that's it... You're the Maki of
this world.
▶Setsuko Sonomura
But why don't I exist here...?
▶Maki
Uh-oh! The dimensional passageway is
about to disappear...!
 ▶Mark
I'm sorry, lady, but we have to chase
down Kandori.
 ▶Setsuko Sonomura
Alright. Just give me one moment!
   ▶Setsuko Sonomura
The dimensional passageway is very
unstable right now.
▶Setsuko Sonomura
Someone has to stay here and operate
the machine.
 ▶Maki
What? No...! We can't leave anyone here!
▶Setsuko Sonomura
I'll do it!
▶Setsuko Sonomura
Don't worry... Go ahead on your own.
▶Setsuko Sonomura
Though I'd be grateful if you came to
get me when this is all over with.
 ▶Maki
Miss...
 ▶Setsuko Sonomura
Yes? Speak quickly... There isn't
much time.
▶Maki
I... don't have a mother...
▶Maki
But if I did... I'd hope for one as
kind and caring as you...
▶Maki
We'll beat Kandori and save your Maki
while we're at it!

Ugh... M-My head...
 ▶Mark
Hey, the old dude survived!
 ▶Maki
Something seems weird about him, though.
▶Dr. Nicholai
Urrgh... Let judgement fall upon the
foolish humans! Mankind needs no future!
   ▶Dr. Nicholai
Ruin! Annihilation! Destruction,
destruction, destruction!
▶Dr. Nicholai
Let judgement fall on mankind! Let the
music of destruction ring out!
 ▶Mark
Dude, what's gotten into you!? C'mon,
why're you talking like Kandori?
  ▶Kandori
Because he's already little more than
my double.
▶Kandori
In fact, humans around the world already
share my desire for annihilation.
▶Maki
Kandori!?
   ▶Mark
What the hell are you talking about!?
   ▶Nanjo
You madman... Have you brainwashed the
entire globe with that mirror!?
 ▶Elly
Good lord... How could you!?
▶Brown
What!?
 ▶Ayase
N-No way!
  ▶Kandori
Everyone following a unified ideology...
Doesn't it sound wonderful?
▶Kandori
I've accomplished something no ruler ever
achieved... I have transcended the human.
   ▶Nanjo
That's preposterous!
   ▶Kandori
All I need to do now is give the order
for them to kill each other...
▶Kandori
And everything will be over. A fitting
end for a species of fools.
▶Kandori
Nothing else will be hurt. Only mankind
will be wiped from this planet.
 ▶Maki
But why!? Why do you want to do this
to people!?
▶Kandori
Hah... That sounds rather unlike you...
Maki Sonomura.
   ▶Maki
How do you know my name...!?
▶Kandori
The mirror's power affects all.
You children are no exception.
▶Kandori
Can you still reach me where I await?
Hahah...
  ▶Reiji
Oh, we'll reach you, you bastard!
Let's go, <FirstName>.
 ▶Elly
Wait!
   ▶Elly
Let's go, <FirstName>!
▶Brown
Wait, you coward!
  ▶Brown
Dammit! Follow me, everyone!
   ▶Ayase
Hold it!
   ▶Ayase
Don't just stare into space, <FirstName>!
▶Ayase
We gotta hurry or my future's gonna
be wiped out!
▶Ayase
So let's go after him already!
   ▶Mark
Maki, Elly, can you stand up?
   ▶Maki
Are you okay, Elly?
 ▶Elly
Ngh... Thanks, Maki. I'm all right now.
 ▶Mark
Get a grip, Hidehiko. You're the leader,
aren't you?
▶Brown
S-Sure I am! I was just messing around
with you guys.
▶Brown
I'm totally fine, just watch me! Grrrr!
  ▶Brown
How was that!? A leader's gotta lead!
Repeat after me! Hehe... just kidding.
   ▶Maki
Haha... You're so funny, Hidehiko.
  ▶Brown
I know, right?
▶Brown
I'm a total stud! Good looks AND a great
sense of humor!
▶Brown
My only rival is Nakai from the Judas
Brothers!
▶Brown
A certain guy in a knit cap can't
beat me.
▶Brown
Yeah, you know what I'm talking about,
Maki!
▶Mark
What an idiot...
▶Nanjo
Well, those and blunt scissors can be
useful in a clever man's hands.
  ▶Maki
Look! Someone's over there!
▶Maki
Oh, it's that old scientist!
 ▶Maki
Are you okay, Yuka?
 ▶Ayase
Grgh... Blaaaaaaagh...
 ▶Mark
Ew... gross!
▶Ayase
Shuddup... I'm clean!
  ▶Maki
Here, Yuka, use my handkerchief.
▶Ayase
...Thanks, Maki.
   ▶Nanjo
It looks as though everyone's all right.
   ▶Mark
That jerk... I can't believe he's gonna
go through with this!
   ▶Maki
How does Kandori know me...!?
   ▶Nanjo
So that's why... It's inconceivable...
 ▶Reiji
There's no telling what dirty tricks
that bastard has in store. Be careful.
▶Elly
I'm worried about the last thing Kandori
said... I have a slight headache.
▶Elly
Don't strain yourself, okay, <FirstName>?
   ▶Brown
Kandori's plan to control people is
out of control! ...That was a joke.
▶Brown
C'mon, <Nickname>... You're supposed
to laugh! Mwahahahaha...
   ▶Brown
What? I'm not all talk, y'know!
▶Ayase
Ugh... Doesn't your head kinda hurt,
<FirstName>?
▶Dr. Nicholai
Now is the time of the final judgement!
Why was mankind created?
▶Dr. Nicholai
Without an answer to that question,
the infection must be cleansed!
 ▶Mark
Dammit! It doesn't look like she's here.
▶Mark
Where are you, Maki!?
   ▶Nanjo
...I can't believe this machine opened
the way into a human soul.
▶Nanjo
Nothing good can come of its continued
existence. We must destroy it somehow.
▶Reiji
If we don't hurry, then judging by what
we saw, it'll be too late for Maki.
▶Elly
Ugh! This isn't it, either! We have
to find her!
▶Brown
Urgh, she's not here!
▶Brown
Where did Maki go!?
  ▶Ayase
Nope, not here either!
▶Ayase
Sheesh, why did we decide to look here?
 ▶Dr. Nicholai
Ugh... What was I doing...?
▶Dr. Nicholai
What!? Is this true!? I see... I'm sorry
we dragged you into all this.
▶Dr. Nicholai
But I have to ask you... can't you
somehow rescue Sonomura's daughter?
▶Dr. Nicholai
I'll do my best to adjust the system so
you can go rescue her whenever you wish!
▶Dr. Nicholai
And once that's done, I'll go to whatever
fate awaits me. I beg you, young man!
  ▶Maki
<FirstName>! Where are you going!?
We have to defeat Kandori!
 ▶Mark
<FirstName>! Where you goin'!?
Aren't you gonna save Maki!?▶Agastya Tree
Young ones... Your presence is welcome.
 ▶Agastya Tree
Will you inscribe your story on me? 
   ▶Agastya Tree
Take care on your journey, young ones...▶Agastya Tree
Young ones... Your presence is welcome.
 ▶Agastya Tree
Will you inscribe your story on me? 
   ▶Agastya Tree
Take care on your journey, young ones...▶Mark
Kandori! This is it! I hope you're ready!
   ▶Reiji
We finally found you... You're not going
anywhere this time!
   ▶Aki
You guys are so aggravating! I won't
let you get in my Daddy's way!
  ▶Kandori
...That's enough, Aki. Stay back.
▶Aki
But, Daddy...
▶Kandori
Wait in the other room. I'll be with
you soon.
   ▶Aki
...Okay, Daddy.
  ▶Maki
Stop causin' all this pain! Turn everyone
back to normal!
   ▶Kandori
...Don't worry. I won't do anything
further.
 ▶Nanjo
......
 ▶Brown
What the hell!? What, all of a sudden
you're not in the mood anymore?
▶Brown
What a bunch of crap... After all we
did to get here!
▶Elly
What!? Something seems peculiar
about this...
   ▶Ayase
Hey! Did you finally snap or something?
Apologizing now won't help!
▶Ayase
I'm too pissed off now!
▶Reiji
...What the hell's with you? Decided to
beg for your life all of a sudden?
 ▶Kandori
...What are you living for?
  ▶Mark
Huh!?
   ▶Kandori
People aren't strong enough to live
without a goal. Everyone wants something.
▶Kandori
No matter how small the desire...
It gives them the strength to carry on.
▶Kandori
But... if every desire is fulfilled,
what's left to strive for?
▶Kandori
When one's wishes have been granted,
the only thing that awaits...
▶Kandori
...is a bottomless solitude; an eternal
emptiness.
▶Kandori
Then wouldn't it be better if one chose
not to ascend the stairs of desire?
▶Kandori
That way... one's dreams are kept alive.
   ▶Kandori
I... kept ascending that stair to destroy
this worthless world...
▶Kandori
But it no longer matters. Right now...
nothing is beyond my grasp.
▶Kandori
Hah. The winds of solitude and emptiness
blow within me... Such is a god's lot.
 ▶Maki
......
  ▶Kandori
Boy... I allowed you to come here in
order to ask you this:
▶Kandori
Why do you cling to life?
  ▶Kandori
What are you living for?Ԙ
   ▶Maki
That's right! Our reason for living...
▶Maki
We may never understand it.
▶Maki
But I still believe in myself!
▶Maki
With or without a reason, I'm going to
live a life I won't regret!
   ▶Maki
That's not it at all! Our reason for
living...
▶Maki
We may never understand it.
But I still believe in myself!
▶Maki
With or without a reason, I'm going to
live a life I won't regret!
▶Mark
Dumbass! How old are you? And you don't
even know that yet?
▶Mark
We're alive so we can do the best we can,
every second of every day.
▶Mark
You're always so frickin' sulky. It's not
good for you, man!
▶Mark
You gotta look on the sunny side!
▶Reiji
Why else...? To kill you and put an end
to your filthy bloodline!
▶Reiji
Until I do that, I can't give my mother
the happiness she deserves!
  ▶Elly
I live to protect the things I treasure.
▶Elly
The people you see here are my most
trusted friends...
▶Elly
Now that I have them, I won't give them
up that easily!
   ▶Brown
So I can be a better man! I'm sick of
lying and running like a coward!
▶Brown
I've made my decision...
▶Brown
I'm gonna beat you and say adios to
the lame, fake me!
 ▶Ayase
For my future husband! I won't have it
easy, I know...
▶Ayase
But I'm gonna have a house, even if it's
small, and I want a boy and a girl.
▶Ayase
I'll name them Takuya and Yuki, and...
 ▶Nanjo
Kandori... Just stop this. It's painful
seeing you so far out on a limb.
   ▶Kandori
What...?
 ▶Nanjo
Surely you must know.
▶Nanjo
The seat of power you've reached by
using people is no divine throne.
▶Nanjo
Deep down, you know none of it was
your doing...
   ▶Kandori
You miserable...
 ▶Nanjo
You're suffering.
▶Nanjo
You despair at your inability to live
any other way.
 ▶Kandori
Stop...
  ▶Nanjo
The same goes for her wish to erase
mankind.
▶Nanjo
It stems from one's anxiety for the
future.
   ▶Kandori
Silence!
 ▶Nanjo
"I want to risk it... But I can't...
If only I could disappear..."
▶Nanjo
Did you think burdening all mankind with
your fears would make them go away?
▶Kandori
......
   ▶Nanjo
Why continue rationalizing your neurosis
with these grandiose principles?
▶Nanjo
No one knows the foolishness of that
more than you.
  ▶Kandori
...I cannot forgive your offenses against
god. I'll cleanse you from this world...
   ▶Mark
Heh, looks like you're finally ready
to throw down!
 ▶Kandori
Can you defeat me?
▶Kandori
Can you protect the things you claim
are precious?
  ▶Reiji
...For my mother and my friends,
I'll kill you.
▶Elly
Yes! We can!
▶Brown
'Course we can!
▶Ayase
Like, duh!
 ▶Kandori
Then prove it before god's throne!
   ▶Kandori
You, boy... I haven't heard your answer
yet.▶Kandori
Hah... To be defeated so... You were
absolutely correct, young Nanjo.
▶Kandori
This... was the only way I knew.
▶Kandori
Maybe I summoned you here because I
wanted to hear someone say it...
▶Kandori
Hah. I must seem a fool... but I feel
remarkably content.
  ▶Nanjo
...Where is the real Maki?
 ▶Kandori
Ah... you've solved the mystery of the
two worlds... I'm not surprised.
  ▶Maki
Kei...? What do you mean?
   ▶Kandori
You and the people of your world were
mere figments of a certain imagination.
▶Kandori
Maki Sonomura's...
   ▶Maki
Huh? What're you saying!? What does
that mean!?
 ▶Nanjo
You're... probably the idealized self
of the Maki Sonomura we know.
▶Nanjo
And the town you live in is the world
inside Maki Sonomura's heart...
▶Nanjo
Am I correct, Kandori?
   ▶Kandori
Yes... and not only her.
▶Kandori
Mai and Aki are also shadows within
Maki Sonomura's heart...
▶Kandori
All of you are nothing more than aspects
of her.
   ▶Maki
No... That's not...!
▶Nanjo
Maki, Mai, Aki... Simple anagrams.
▶Nanjo
Maki must have conceived of her own
paradise in her heart...
▶Nanjo
One modeled off her memories of Mikage
until the day she was hospitalized.
 ▶Mark
No way... Then there was no police
station or hospital because...
   ▶Nanjo
They have no place in paradise. She only
had room for what was useful...
▶Nanjo
It's a common sentiment.
▶Nanjo
Chisato and Yosuke were no doubt drawn
in by Maki's unconscious desires.
▶Nanjo
When it came to her crush and her best
friend, she wanted the genuine article.
  ▶Kandori
The trial run of the Deva System
succeeded roughly a month ago.
▶Kandori
But... she was linked to the system
even before then.
▶Kandori
Her wavelength must have synchronized
with the system's.
▶Kandori
Once she had internalized the power to
interfere with the dimensions...
▶Kandori
The paradise within her heart seems to
have grown beyond our imaginations.
▶Nanjo
And you came into contact with Mai,
caretaker of that paradise...
  ▶Kandori
Mai... No. That Maki was isolated.
She had her role for the ideal Maki...
▶Kandori
To provide the world she'd always wanted
as comfort for Maki in the real world.
▶Kandori
You know the rest...
   ▶Maki
You're lying! None of that makes sense!
 ▶Kandori
Then go... Meet your true self...
She is here, in this castle...
 ▶Maki
But I'm me! This... this is too much!
   ▶Mark
Maki!
   ▶Elly
<FirstName>! We have to go after her!
 ▶Brown
This is bad, <Nickname>...
We should go after her!
  ▶Ayase
Uh oh... Well, <FirstName>!?
Aren't you gonna go after her?
  ▶Reiji
Aren't you going after her? You're the
only one who can save her, you know.
▶Kandori
Maki Sonomura... she needs to discover
her true self.
▶Kandori
If she doesn't, she'll share my fate...
▶Kandori
Go to her... Don't let her go down that
lonely path...
 ▶Nanjo
...What a pitiful man...
   ▶Mark
<FirstName>! We gotta look for Maki!
  ▶Mark
It's gotta be a lie! It's too much
for Maki...!
 ▶Nanjo
I've been thinking it over all this time,
and my conclusions still surprised me.
   ▶Reiji
...I finally killed the bastard...
Then why this empty feeling...?
 ▶Elly
Poor Maki... We need to help her.
   ▶Brown
Is this for real? What's going to
happen to Maki?
  ▶Ayase
I can't believe this... Hey! What's gonna
happen to Maki, huh!?
> Kandori looks peaceful in death...
  > There's an inscription on the wall...
> "A man's life of fifty years is a
fleeting dream next to the age of the
universe. Does anything last forever?"▶Maki
This... This can't be...
▶Maki
You idiot! Why did you kill Daddy!?
▶Maki
Don't you know what you did!?
▶Maki
Waaaaaaaaaaaah!
 ▶Maki
This is me...? No... I made everyone
suffer...?
 ▶Maki
You killed the only one the real me
could rely on!
▶Maki
No one will save us now! It's all over!
   ▶Reiji
There's three Makis... Are they all her?
   ▶Elly
Three's... three of her... Jesus Christ.
They're all Maki...
▶Brown
There's three Makis? No way... This is
some sick joke, right?
  ▶Ayase
They're all Maki? Seriously?
That's just...
▶Mark
Maki!
   ▶Maki
No... Don't come near me... Don't look
at me!
   ▶Mark
Calm down, Maki! This has to be some
kinda mistake... right?
▶Maki
Stop saying that! That's a lie!
This is me, I can tell!
▶Maki
I messed up the town and made everyone
suffer! I did that...!
▶Reiji
Don't take it so hard. He was using you!
   ▶Elly
Calm down, Maki!
▶Elly
You were being used... There's no need
to let it get to you, okay?
  ▶Brown
Calm down! You were being used, and it
sucks, but that's all it was.
▶Brown
Okay? C'mon, get over here.
   ▶Ayase
Maki! You don't have to take it so hard!
It was all Kandori's fault anyways!
   ▶Maki
No... that's not it...
  ▶Maki
Please don't be nice to me...
I understand everything now.
▶Maki
I was jealous of everyone...
▶Maki
Wearing cute clothes, walking
around town...
▶Maki
Gossiping about each other's
boyfriends...
▶Maki
Laughing and joking...
▶Maki
I envied everyone who went to school
and had fun with their friends...
▶Maki
I wished... that school and the town
would all be swallowed up...
   ▶Mark
Maki...
 ▶Maki
Even if I wanted to do something about it,
I couldn't... I cried and cried...
▶Maki
My jealousy and loathing grew... I made
up an ideal town to comfort myself...
▶Maki
Now do you understand? I'm hopeless...
▶Maki
I don't deserve to live!
▶Maki
*sniffle*... Y-You!?
▶Maki
It's all over for you, too.
Kandori is gone.
▶Maki
Erusaer Tsymmom.
▶Maki
N-No! Noooo!
▶Maki
Now this quiet town will go back to how
it was... Thank you, mister.
▶Maki
You're... You're going to keep living
there!?
   ▶Maki
Yes... If I don't, I'll feel sorry
for myself...
▶Maki
You're going back, too. I want you to
keep acting as my ideal self.
 ▶Maki
No! I don't want to go back there!
  ▶Maki
Erusaer Tsymmom.
▶Maki
No!
<FirstName>...!
   ▶Maki
Hm... You like this boy now...
▶Maki
Okay. I'll make him, too.
▶Maki
It's easy... Bye bye, mister.
▶Mark
Maki!
Makiiii!
▶Maki
Yes, it's all over! Everyone should
just disappear!
▶Maki
Disappear, everyone!
 ▶Mark
Maki! Come over here, okay?
 ▶Maki
I... I can't be with you all anymore...
 ▶Maki
Please... send me back into my heart!
   ▶Mark
Maki!
   ▶Mark
You... you idiot! Why, dammit!?
 ▶Mark
<FirstName>! Let's go back into Maki's
heart!
 ▶Nanjo
...Wait, Masao. Do you know the story of
the foolish girl named Pandora?
   ▶Mark
Huh?
▶Nanjo
The legend says she opened the gods' box,
releasing all sorts of evils...
▶Nanjo
It applies to Maki. This town owes its
miserable condition to her wishes.
▶Nanjo
Rather than save her, we should focus
on destroying the Deva System.
   ▶Mark
Y-You asshole... How can you talk that
way about a friend!?
▶Mark
If we destroy that thing, what's gonna
happen to Maki?
   ▶Nanjo
From the looks of it, the system is
keeping Maki alive...
▶Nanjo
If we destroy it, Maki will most likely
die as a result.
▶Nanjo
But as long as the system is intact, the
fundamental problem remains unsolved.
▶Nanjo
Don't let your personal feelings sway
you...
▶Nanjo
A small sacrifice for the greater
good... The choice is obvious.
▶Mark
I hope you're ready for this!
   ▶Mark
I had you all wrong... I didn't think
you could really be that cold.
▶Mark
Maybe what you're sayin' is true.
It's the kinda logic an adult would use.
▶Mark
But dude... Maki might've made us suffer,
but she also tried to save us all...
▶Mark
I believe in Maki. I know she has what
it takes to break away from that machine.
▶Elly
Yes... We need to let Maki know that
she isn't alone.
   ▶Brown
You said it, man. If this'll help Maki
make peace with herself, I'm in.
▶Ayase
I'm gonna go, too. I borrowed her
handkerchief, y'know...
  ▶Reiji
I'm going in... if that girl in white
is Maki too, I owe her for rescuing me.
  ▶Nanjo
Heh... You believe in her, eh?
Yamaoka said he believed in me, too...
▶Nanjo
Man is an emotional creature, I suppose.
We can split hairs all we like...
▶Nanjo
But the ultimate decision is made by
one's heart.
▶Nanjo
I'll go in as well.
 ▶Mark
Sheesh, you and your arguments. You coulda
just come out and said so...
▶Mark
Wouldn't a clever, mature adult stay here?
   ▶Nanjo
Unfortunately, as a boy of 17, I'm not
legally considered an adult yet.
▶Mark
Heheh... When will I learn? You always
got some kinda comeback all ready...
 ▶Nanjo
Good deeds should be done swiftly.
Let's dive back into Maki's soul.
   ▶Elly
What the--Something's in the mirror!
▶Brown
H-Hey! Something appeared in the mirror!
   ▶Ayase
Huh!? Something's in the mirror now!
   ▶Reiji
Look, the mirror! There's something
there now...▶Agastya Tree
Young ones... Your presence is welcome.
 ▶Agastya Tree
Will you inscribe your story on me? 
   ▶Agastya Tree
Take care on your journey, young ones...▶Agastya Tree
Young ones... Your presence is welcome.
 ▶Agastya Tree
Will you inscribe your story on me? 
   ▶Agastya Tree
Take care on your journey, young ones...▶Agastya Tree
Young ones... Your presence is welcome.
 ▶Agastya Tree
Will you inscribe your story on me? 
   ▶Agastya Tree
Take care on your journey, young ones...▶Mark
H-Hey... it disappeared!
▶Mark
Now what!? We can't get back like this!
 ▶Nanjo
Something must have happened at the town
inside Maki's heart...
▶Nanjo
With Kandori gone, she's the only one
who could do something like this.
▶Reiji
What about Kandori's mirror? Let's just
have it send us back.
  ▶Elly
Mark! If we make a wish to Kandori's
mirror, can't we get back to that town?
▶Brown
Oh yeah! We still got Kandori's mirror!
▶Brown
We just have to make a wish, and poof!
We're back in business!
 ▶Ayase
Oh hey, what about Kandori's mirror!?
▶Ayase
Let's just like, wish for it to send us
back there!
  ▶Mark
Oh yeah, we could still do that, huh?
   ▶Mark
Whoa! I-Is this for real!?
  ▶Nanjo
Is Maki resisting us...!? It seems
that way to me...
   ▶Mark
Dammit! What're we gonna do... Hm?
  ▶Mark
Maki must've dropped this. But it won't
do us any good on its own...
▶Nanjo
What is it, Masao?
 ▶Mark
It's Maki's compact...
  ▶Nanjo
Hm. There's no mirror inside...
▶Reiji
Hey, the Maki over here has a
compact, too.
▶Elly
Hey! The original Maki has a
compact, too!
  ▶Brown
Hey, the real Maki has a compact, too!
 ▶Ayase
Look! The real Maki has a compact too!
 ▶Nanjo
Let's see here...
▶Nanjo
The real Maki's compact and the ideal
Maki's compact...
▶Nanjo
The real one has a mirror. Hmm...
▶Mark
Gimme that, Nanjo!
  ▶Mark
Please! Send us back into Maki's heart!
▶Mark
......
   ▶Nanjo
The compact couldn't possibly have such
powers in the real world.
▶Nanjo
If only the ideal Maki's compact was
complete, then maybe...
 ▶Mark
Maki... Everyone wants to see you,
y'know? There's no need to suffer alone.
▶Mark
Just call on us, please... I'd go
anywhere for you...
▶Nanjo
The ideal Maki is the manifestation of
Maki wanting to change herself.
▶Nanjo
But if her ideal self denied its own
existence...
▶Nanjo
Maki... have you really lost hope?
▶Nanjo
If there's even a fragment left,
call out to us...
 ▶Reiji
Quit sticking your head in a hole,
Maki! It's the easy way out...
▶Reiji
My mom was Kandori's dad's old mistress.
She got thrown away like an old rag.
▶Reiji
But even knowing that would happen...
She still gave birth to me.
▶Reiji
Know why she did that?
▶Reiji
She told me she couldn't neglect her own
child's life...
▶Reiji
You have a mom too. No parent alive
doesn't love their child.
▶Reiji
You're gonna see your mom again, so hurry
and wake up!
 ▶Elly
Maki! Please wake up! Please...
▶Elly
You're not the only one who suffers from
having multiple aspects of yourself...
▶Elly
Everyone says how elegant and beautiful
I am, but it's not true at all.
▶Elly
I've always acted like someone I'm not.
I hate seeing boys talk to other girls...
▶Elly
That's why I always wear a fake smile.
It was so stifling... I'm no good, am I?
▶Elly
But I understand now.
▶Elly
What I really needed are friends I can
trust. The ones I have with me here...
▶Elly
I like someone now. You probably like
him too, Maki... Please wake up...
▶Elly
I wish I could talk to you again, about
things like him. Okay? So wake up...
 ▶Brown
Rise and shine, Maki, and I'll tell you
the funniest story I know!
▶Brown
Y'know how they call me Brown? It's a
nickname I picked up in middle school...
▶Brown
People think it's about my brown hair...
But really... իIt's 'cause I crapped myself.
▶Brown
See? Isn't that funny? Man, it was
embarrassing...
▶Brown
I spent most of middle school as the
butt of every joke in the class...
▶Brown
I was sick of myself. I came to Hermelin
'cause I couldn't take the local schools.
▶Brown
So when I got to high school, I did my
best to act like Mr. Cool...
▶Brown
But I was lying to myself all this time.
▶Brown
No more, though. I realized how dumb I
was being from watching you...
▶Brown
So there it is. Now c'mon... give us
a smile...
  ▶Ayase
Wakey wakey, Maki!
▶Ayase
I still have your handkerchief. Anything
you wanna talk about, I'll listen...
▶Ayase
I get how you feel. I used to think the
same way...
▶Ayase
I would like, wish there would be no
future...
▶Ayase
I worry about the future a lot. I think
that's why I party so hard...
▶Ayase
'Cause the future's too depressing to
think about, right?
▶Ayase
So I made up my mind to live only for
now, and ran away from the future...
▶Ayase
But it doesn't work like that.
▶Ayase
It's my future. I have to come up with
it myself... So I've made my choice.
▶Ayase
I'm gonna snag a great guy so I can live
on easy street! So, Maki...
▶Ayase
I wanna hear your dreams for the future,
too. Please, Maki... please...

Is that a shard of Kandori's mirror!?

This size and shape... I think it may
fit Maki's compact!
   ▶Mark
Seriously!? Maybe we can use this to
go back!

Lemme see that, <FirstName>!

It's a perfect fit!

My name is Igor... I am delighted to
make your acquaintance.
▶Igor
This place exists between dream and
reality, mind and matter...
▶Igor
It's been quite some time since we last
had a guest.
▶Igor
This is a room that only those bound by
a "contract" may enter...
▶Igor
From this day forth, you will be our
guest in this Velvet Room.
▶Igor
Your destiny will require you to hone
your power...
▶Igor
And for that, you will inevitably
require our help.
▶Igor
The Velvet Room is also known as the
room of Personas.
▶Igor
A Persona is a side of you that shows
itself when you face the world...
▶Igor
Think of it as a facade of protection
you wear to face hardships in life.
▶Igor
Hm... Perhaps that may have been rather
difficult to understand...
▶Igor
To battle opponents that cannot be
dealt with by human strength alone...
▶Igor
We in this room will lend you inhuman
power... The power of demons...
▶Igor
Now then. Allow me to explain my role
here...
▶Igor
I will assist you in giving birth to
new Personas.
▶Igor
The demons contained within the |ԏspell
cards|  you hold will be fused as one...
▶Igor
Thereby creating a new Persona.
▶Igor
Should you find yourselves with these
cards, please do bring them here.
  ▶Igor
Welcome to the Velvet Room...
   ▶Igor
What is it you desire?
▶Igor
Well then, what would you like
to know?Ԡ
   ▶Igor
I'm afraid you don't have enough |ԏspell
cards|  to give birth to a new Persona.
▶Igor
Alas, we cannot look after any more
Personas.
   ▶Igor
What would you like to do?Ԟ
▶Igor
Well then... Farewell...
▶Igor
If it's new Personas you want, I shall
fuse and create them for you.
▶Igor
First, though, I must summon demons to
fuse together into a Persona.
▶Igor
And for that, a certain type of card
is necessary.
▶Igor
You see, these cards are inscribed with
demon-summoning spells.
▶Igor
They are known as spell cards, and all
demons carry one.
▶Igor
Thus, in order to perform a fusion, I
will need you to gather spell cards.
▶Igor
Go forth, negotiate with demons,
and bring these spell cards back here.
▶Igor
Combat is not the only way to deal
with demons... Do you understand?
▶Igor
And not all demons are necessarily
wishing for a fight...
 ▶Igor
It isn't enough merely to fuse a new
Persona in order to make it your own...
▶Igor
There is rather more to it than that,
I'm afraid.
▶Igor
You must take a Persona onto yourself
in order to use its power.
▶Igor
Each of you is capable of holding up
to three Personas.
▶Igor
A newly-fused Persona will be entrusted
into my care.
▶Igor
By all means let me know when you
would like to take on new Personas.
▶Igor
But I can only look after 16 Personas
at a time, mind you.
▶Igor
There are as many Personas as there are
personalities... an infinite variety.
▶Igor
Each has its own form and substance,
to be used according to the situation.
▶Igor
If you can master that principle,
you will make a fine Persona-user.
▶Igor
Each of you can take on as many as
three Personas at once.
▶Igor
Of the three, only one can be actively
invoked during battle.
▶Igor
To invoke a Persona is to summon it
in combat.
▶Igor
The remaining two will remain on
standby...
▶Igor
Ready to be assumed at any time
during battle.
▶Igor
Different active Personas will grant
you different abilities.
▶Igor
Without the power of Persona, you are
no different than an ordinary human...
▶Igor
You will be powerless before the arcane
might of the demons' spells.
▶Igor
If by chance you were hit by a spell in
that state, you would be struck down.
▶Igor
But by taking on a Persona, your defense
against spells is considerably enhanced.
▶Igor
For some, it may also confer strength,
or increase luck for others.
▶Igor
This, too, is the power of Persona.
▶Igor
Though they are called Personas, each
is a hidden side of yourself.
▶Igor
I suggest you examine your status
carefully after assuming one.
▶Igor
That way, you can see which of your
qualities have changed.
▶Igor
At first, you will be unable to harness
your Persona's powers to the fullest.
▶Igor
But the more you invoke a Persona,
the more powers it will grant you.
▶Igor
As your Persona learns new skills, you
will have more options in battle.
▶Igor
Even if your Persona learns a powerful
skill, the SP required remains constant.
▶Igor
You will grow in combat, but do not
forget that your Personas grow as well.
▶Igor
Pardon me for being nosy, but...
▶Igor
Personas have eight levels of growth.
You should try to develop them fully.
▶Igor
I'm sure that there will be an ample
reward for doing so...
▶Igor
You might also be interested to know
about various factors in fusion.
▶Igor
For example, even when creating the
same Persona...
▶Igor
The combination of spell cards, the
affinities of the demons used...
▶Igor
The position of Terra and Luna, and any
essences added into the mix...
▶Igor
All of these factor into the resultant
Persona. And one more thing...
▶Igor
You may also add an item into the
fusion to trigger a change.
▶Igor
There are some items for which the
result is easily predictable...
▶Igor
But sometimes, even I will be unable
to guess at what may happen.
▶Igor
Should that come about, I do hope that
you'll pardon me.
▶Igor
But make no mistake, I do believe it
is worth trying...
▶Igor
I suggest gems for obtaining a higher-
or lower-ranked fusion within an order.
▶Igor
As for the other items' effects, you
should experiment for yourself.▶Agastya Tree

You kids!? Are you all right!?
  ▶Mark
Owwww! Ugh... Huh?
▶Mark
I get it... The compact brought
us here...
▶Nanjo
Ngh... Where are we!?
  ▶Reiji
Looks like it worked...
▶Reiji
This looks like the forest where that
girl in white was... the child-Maki.
 ▶Elly
Bingo! This is child-Maki's forest!
 ▶Brown
Hey, it worked! Isn't this the forest
where that little Maki was!?
 ▶Ayase
Wow, talk about luck! Isn't this that
little Maki's forest!?
   ▶Setsuko Sonomura
Why have you all come back!?
What about Kandori!?
   ▶Mark
Same to you, lady! Why're YOU here?
 ▶Setsuko Sonomura
I... don't really know...
▶Setsuko Sonomura
After I transported you all, I thought
I heard Maki's voice again...
▶Setsuko Sonomura
And when I came to, I was here...
But why have you all come back?
  ▶Nanjo
Allow me to explain. You should know
the truth...
  ▶Setsuko Sonomura
No... That can't be...
▶Setsuko Sonomura
What about Maki!? What's going to
happen to her!?
 ▶Nanjo
If we leave her be, she'll stay that way
for the rest of her life. Or worse...
 ▶Setsuko Sonomura
No... Can't you do something!?
My Maki...!
  ▶Mark
Cool it, lady! That's why we came back.
 ▶Reiji
Don't worry... We won't let it end
like this.
  ▶Elly
Don't worry. We definitely won't leave
Maki hanging!
▶Brown
Relax! Just have fate in us--you can
forget all about it!
  ▶Nanjo
That's "faith," you cretin!
▶Brown
Yeah, faith, exactly! It'll be fine!
Hahahahaha!
   ▶Mark
The dude shows his true colors. After
all that stuff about pretending...
▶Nanjo
Indeed. He's innately imbecilic... not
a man to be ashamed of soiling himself.
 ▶Brown
Mwahahahahahah!
▶Ayase
Don't worry, Maki-Mom! I'm more
competent than I look, y'know!
 ▶Setsuko Sonomura
Thank you, everyone...
  ▶Mai's voice
Waaah... *sniff*
 ▶Setsuko Sonomura
Was that Maki's voice!? She must be
just past here!
 ▶Mark
Let's go! That li'l Maki might know
something!
  ▶Setsuko Sonomura
Wait! Please... take me with you!
▶Setsuko Sonomura
She's my daughter! I can't leave her
suffering like this!
  ▶Nanjo
...Very well.
▶Nanjo
However, this forest is hazardous.
Your survival is far from assured.
▶Setsuko Sonomura
I don't care about that!
▶Nanjo
Then that settles that. Come on,
<LastName>.
▶Nanjo
Let's reunite a mother with her child.
 ▶Mark
Heh... She's one super mom.
Good looking, too!
▶Mark
My mom... she's just a loud nag.
But she better still be alive!
▶Mark
I don't think she'd die that easy...
   ▶Mark
C'mon! We gotta hurry, or we'll be in
even more hot water!
  ▶Nanjo
That woman is a true mother...
▶Nanjo
I don't even know my own mother's
birthday...
▶Nanjo
At home, everyone other than Yamaoka
was like a total stranger to me.
▶Nanjo
All I received from my parents was
money and material possessions.
▶Nanjo
<FirstName>... We must reunite her with
Maki, even at the cost of our lives.
   ▶Nanjo
This whole ordeal has made me think.
▶Nanjo
I never considered the multiple sides of
myself... but now they're irrefutable.
   ▶Reiji
That's how mothers really are inside...
Their kids just don't know it.
 ▶Reiji
How long do you intend to stand around
here? Aren't we going to the shrine?
▶Elly
<FirstName>...... Is it weird to hear me
talk like this?
  ▶Elly
Did you... like the way I used to talk
better? 
▶Elly
I see... Then I'll speak more politely.
 ▶Elly
Good! I was worried you would think
it was weird!
▶Elly
<FirstName>... Thanks...
 ▶Elly
Quickly! We must hurry and get to
the shrine!
   ▶Elly
Hurry up! We need to move it and get
to the shrine!
 ▶Brown
Hey, <Nickname>! If you think I'm the
same me I always was, you're dead wrong!
▶Brown
Now that I've matured a little, call me
Brown Mk.II!
▶Brown
Huh? Whaddaya mean, that sounds lame?
So what should I call myself, then?
   ▶Brown
We're going to the shrine next, right?
Well, "more haste, less speed"!
▶Brown
Huh? That's not what that means...?
Well, it is when I say it!
  ▶Ayase
Huh... Y'know, up close, you're a 
pretty good-looking guy, <FirstName>!
 ▶Ayase
Want me to put you down on my list
of potential husbands?ԧ
▶Ayase
Beep! Got it! Okay, keep working
yourself to the bone for me!
  ▶Ayase
What!? Are you saying I'm not good
enough for you!?
▶Ayase
Fine! Like I care! I'll dump even more
of my share of the work on you now!
 ▶Ayase
We're going to the shrine, right?
▶Ayase
I wonder if all this trudging around
counts as a workout.
▶Setsuko Sonomura
I'm... such an awful mother.
▶Setsuko Sonomura
My daughter is suffering, and I can't
do anything for her...
▶Maki
The next one's the real me, huh?
I wonder how many mes there are...
 ▶Elly
Little Maki... She's all alone in
this desolate place...
▶Elly
Child-Maki... She's all alone in
such an isolated place...
  ▶Ayase
Hey <FirstName>, that teeny Maki's all
alone here, huh?
▶Ayase
I couldn't stand it, if it was me.
   ▶Ayase
Hey <Nickname>, that teeny Maki's all
alone here, huh?
▶Ayase
I couldn't stand it, if it was me.

   ▶Maki
Waaaaaaaah! Mommy!
  ▶Setsuko Sonomura
I'm sorry, Maki... I'm so sorry...
  ▶Maki
Mommy! Mommy! Waaaaaaaah!
   ▶Mark
Are you calming down...?
▶Maki
...Uh-huh.
  ▶Mark
Maki... We want to help you.
The real you.
▶Mark
I know that sounds weird, but is there
anything you can do?
   ▶Maki
Nuh-uh... Nothing.
  ▶Nanjo
Why not? Aren't you also one aspect
of Maki?
   ▶Maki
Aki wants to make this world go away...
She went to where the really bad me is.
 ▶Mark
There's ANOTHER one of her?
 ▶Maki
The really bad me is called Pandora...
Aki broke Pandora's seal.
▶Maki
Pandora swallowed Aki, and now she's
trying to make this world go away.
▶Maki
But if she does that... We'll...
I'll... die...
  ▶Reiji
Then where can we find this Pandora?
   ▶Elly
Is that true!? Then where is this
Pandora!?
 ▶Elly
Is this true!? Then where would one
find Pandora?
   ▶Brown
What!? Then how do we get to Pandora!?
 ▶Ayase
No way! Seriously!? Then, uhh, where
do we find Pandora!?
  ▶Nanjo
The school...! She must be beyond that
door we found in the library.
▶Nanjo
Am I correct?
 ▶Maki
Uh-huh.
▶Maki
But you'll need the three compacts...
and my energetic self's help.
  ▶Nanjo
Energetic... You mean the ideal Maki?
▶Nanjo
We have the three compacts, don't we?
▶Reiji
I remember you had two of them,
<FirstName>.
▶Reiji
Red and green... We're missing one.
 ▶Elly
<FirstName>, aren't you carrying two of
them already?
▶Elly
One red and one green... We only need
one more.
  ▶Elly
You have two of them, right <FirstName>?
▶Elly
Red and green... We just need one more.
   ▶Brown
Didn't you have two already, <Nickname>?
▶Brown
Red and green, huh...? We're still
missing one.
▶Ayase
Hey <Nickname>, didn't you have them?
▶Ayase
One red one and one green one?
So we're still missing one...
  ▶Ayase
Hey <FirstName>, didn't you have them?
▶Ayase
One red one and one green one?
So we're still missing one...
  ▶Nanjo
Where's the final compact and the
ideal Maki?
  ▶Maki
Please save the energetic me first...
It's all my fault...
▶Maki
My energetic self is crying deeper
in the forest...
   ▶Setsuko Sonomura
There's another Maki behind this door?
Then I'm coming with you all!
▶Mark
You guys okay with that? I mean, she's
come this far... Let's go, <FirstName>.
▶Maki
I'm sorry, me.
  ▶Maki
That's all right... I'm the one who
should apologize. I'm sorry, me.
▶Maki
I'm the ideal Maki Sonomura. It's not
like me to be so down.
▶Maki
Now, can you tell us where the last
compact is?
 ▶Maki
Uh-huh. The real me has it.
 ▶Mark
The real you? Isn't that where we
got the green one?
▶Mark
<FirstName> already has that one.
 ▶Maki
Nope. That's the one from the real
world.
▶Maki
The real me's consciousness is at the
Alaya Cavern now.
▶Maki
She has the last compact.
   ▶Maki
The Alaya Cavern?
   ▶Maki
It's behind the shrine.
 ▶Setsuko Sonomura
I'm--
   ▶Maki
Mommy... would you please wait here
with me?
▶Setsuko Sonomura
Why? Why can't I go too!?
   ▶Maki
I want to deal with this. It'll be
okay... I have friends to help.
  ▶Setsuko Sonomura
Maki... All right. But you'd better
come back, do you hear me?
  ▶Maki
Hey, me? Look after Mom, okay?
  ▶Maki
Yep! I will. Be careful... me.
▶Maki
When you have all three compacts, chant
the spell in front of Pandora's door.
▶Maki
That should open it.
 ▶Nanjo
Then let's be on our way to the
|ԏAlaya Shrine| .
  ▶Maki
Mai's me, too...
▶Maki
I just realized... I was pretty cute
when I was little.
▶Maki
Huh? Heehee... maybe that was just
a little bit conceited.
 ▶Mark
Man, I'm confused. How many Makis are
there, anyways?
   ▶Mark
Heh... She's been cute ever since she
was a little girl, huh?
   ▶Nanjo
Deeper in the woods... We should hurry,
<FirstName>.
 ▶Nanjo
Hm... a genuine conversation with one's
inner child. A strange sight to see...
 ▶Reiji
What? My "face looks gentle"?
▶Reiji
You keep joking around, and that
won't be true for long.
   ▶Reiji
Huh? I'm smiling!?
▶Reiji
Don't get the wrong idea...
It's just my cavities acting up.
▶Elly
Haha... Kids calm down quick when they
can have a cry in their mom's arms.
▶Elly
What do you think, <FirstName>? Do you
like domestic girls?
 ▶Elly
Ahah... Children feel most at ease
crying in their mother's arms...
▶Elly
<FirstName>? Do you prefer domestic
girls yourself?
▶Elly
I was really cute too, at that age.
Want to see a photo sometime?
   ▶Elly
I was quite cute myself, at that age.
Would you like to see a photo sometime?
   ▶Brown
Little Maki's so cute... But if it was
like, Little Nanjo or Little Mark...
▶Brown
They wouldn't be cute at all. Hell,
I'd probably punch 'em!
▶Brown
I was really cute as a kid, too. The
neighborhood ladies were all over me!
▶Brown
No, really! I'd be walking around and
they'd wipe my nose for me.
   ▶Ayase
Hey, <FirstName>, what kind of kid were
you when you were little?
▶Ayase
I was a little cutie, but isn't it gross
to imagine Hidehiko and Nanjo like that?
  ▶Ayase
Hey, <Nickname>, what kind of kid were
you when you were little?
▶Ayase
I was a little cutie, but isn't it gross
to imagine Hidehiko and Nanjo like that?
  ▶Ayase
Um, okay, so there's teeny Maki and
ideal Maki, right?
▶Ayase
And then real Maki... Ugh, it makes my
head hurt.
   ▶Ayase
Um, okay, so there's teeny Maki and
ideal Maki, right?
▶Ayase
And then real Maki... Ugh, it makes my
head hurt.
   ▶Maki
My ideal self is crying deeper inside...
▶Maki
Only my ideal self can save the
real me...
  ▶Setsuko Sonomura
I never would have imagined that girl
was the ideal Maki...
 ▶Setsuko Sonomura
Hm? Erusaer Tsymmom?
▶Setsuko Sonomura
Oh... it's something I taught Maki when
she was little.
▶Setsuko Sonomura
With her father dead and me busy with
work, Maki was always alone...
▶Setsuko Sonomura
So I taught her this spell to chant
when she was lonely at the hospital.
▶Setsuko Sonomura
I told her that wherever Mommy was,
I could always sense her presence...
▶Setsuko Sonomura
And she remembered it all this time...
Try saying it backwards.
▶Setsuko Sonomura
That girl's still my treasure...▶Setsuko Sonomura
Maki, it's me! Your mother! Let's go
back together!
▶Setsuko Sonomura
Look! These people came all this way
because they were worried about you!
▶Maki
Don't come near me! Why...
Why did you all come here!?
▶Maki
Don't you know what kind of girl I am?
▶Mark
Maki... I know you feel like you can't
just let it go...
▶Mark
But doesn't everyone get jealous now
and then, one way or another?
▶Mark
I know I do.
▶Mark
And on top of that, you were just being
used. It's Kandori's fault, not yours.
▶Maki
How often did I try to kill everyone!?
How can you be so nice to me!?
▶Maki
I don't want pity. It just makes me more
miserable... I deserve to die!
▶Mark
That's not true!
▶Nanjo
What a petulant child...
   ▶Reiji
......
 ▶Elly
Maki...
 ▶Brown
Dude, Maki...
  ▶Ayase
Aw, Maki...
▶Maki
You know it, don't you, <FirstName>!?
 ▶Maki
You know I'm the worst girl alive!ԛ
▶Nanjo
Get a grip! You've sown these seeds
and now it's time to reap them!
▶Nanjo
If you want to die, then why sit around
and mope about it?
▶Nanjo
Don't make empty threats if you don't
have the courage of your convictions!
 ▶Maki
......
  ▶Nanjo
You spoke of pity? Don't make me laugh.
▶Nanjo
We came here of our own will because
we could sympathize with you.
▶Nanjo
But even before that... Did you think
you were alone in this world?
▶Nanjo
We live at the sufferance of others.
Each is responsible for each.
▶Nanjo
Your careless decision would have left
behind wounds that would never heal.
▶Nanjo
If you still want to die, even now,
go ahead. Put it all behind you.
▶Nanjo
But you're our friend, and we can never
put you behind us.
  ▶Nanjo
Now let's get back. We still have to
rescue Maki on our own.
▶Nanjo
I don't leave things undone.
  ▶Maki
Wait!
▶Maki
I'm sorry, everyone... Please...
Please let me come along.
 ▶Mark
Hehe... Of course you can come!
Welcome back, Maki!
 ▶Reiji
Heh...
 ▶Elly
Welcome back aboard, Maki!
  ▶Brown
Woo-hoo! Good to have you back, Maki!
  ▶Ayase
Yay! Welcome back, Maki!
   ▶Maki
I'm back, guys!
 ▶Setsuko Sonomura
*sniffle* Thank you, all of you...
Thank you so much...
 ▶Maki
Mom... I'm sorry. I've been bad...
I remember it all now.
▶Maki
I was so lonely being by myself...
It hurt... I wanted to see you...
▶Maki
I forgot you were working for my sake,
and held a grudge... I'm so sorry.
  ▶Setsuko Sonomura
It's okay. It's all right, Maki...
I'm sorry, too.
  ▶Maki
I'm sorry, Nanjo, and you too,
<FirstName>...
▶Maki
Thank you very much...
   ▶Nanjo
...I should apologize, too. I said
some harsh things.
  ▶Mark
Nanjo? Dude... are you blushing!?
Haha, I get it!
▶Mark
You're so stuck-up, this is the first
time anyone's ever thanked you!
  ▶Nanjo
S-Silence, Masao! Honestly...
Let's get back, <FirstName>!
   ▶Nanjo
<FirstName> is right! You've sown these
seeds and now it's time to reap them!
▶Nanjo
If you want to die, then why sit around
and mope about it?
▶Nanjo
Don't make empty threats if you don't
have the courage of your convictions!
 ▶Maki
I've finally come to my senses.
▶Maki
Even if I'm a dream, or an illusion,
or a shadow, I'm still me...
▶Maki
Plus, I have <FirstName> and the rest of
you with me! That's all I need...
▶Mark
I guess Nanjo's harebrained arguments
do come in handy once in a while.
 ▶Nanjo
Hmp. It's nothing unusual for people
to thank me, I can assure you.
▶Reiji
A touching scene, but we can't stick
around here forever, you know.
▶Elly
Whew, it all worked out. But <FirstName>,
if that had happened to me...
▶Elly
Oh, I shouldn't act so weird. Sorry.
I'm sure you'd come and rescue me...
▶Elly
I'm glad everything worked out. But if
it had happened to me, <FirstName>...
▶Elly
No. I'm sorry for acting so strange.
I'm sure you'd come to my aid, <FirstName>.
  ▶Brown
*sniff* That was so touching, even I
couldn't help but tear up...
  ▶Ayase
That was pretty harsh, <FirstName>.
I was worried about what might happen.
   ▶Ayase
That was pretty harsh, <Nickname>.
I was worried about what might happen.
   ▶Setsuko Sonomura
I don't know how to thank you all...
▶Setsuko Sonomura

friends. Thanks again...▶Agastya Tree

It's that butterfly again!▶Mysterious butterfly
Young man, only two may enter the
cavern. Are you fully prepared?
▶Mysterious butterfly
Are you fully stocked with the
weapons and items you require?
  ▶Mysterious butterfly
Will you enter the cavern? 
▶Mysterious butterfly
I see. Then I shall open the path
to the sea of consciousness.
  ▶Mysterious butterfly
I see. Then prepare yourselves and
return here.
 ▶Mysterious butterfly
Are you ready now?
  ▶Mysterious butterfly
Would you like to go elsewhere?
Then rejoin your comrades.
  ▶Mysterious butterfly
Will you rejoin your comrades? 
▶Mysterious butterfly
Return when you are ready.
  ▶Mysterious butterfly
If you're considering going outside,
don't forget to rejoin your comrades.
  ▶Mark
...I'm putting Maki in your hands, man.
 ▶Nanjo
We'll be waiting here. Don't take any
silly risks.
 ▶Maki
Then we'll be off.
Let's go, <FirstName>!
 ▶Mark
Yo, <FirstName>! Don't try any funny stuff
just 'cause you and Maki are alone!
▶Maki
What are you two chatting about?
▶Mark
Uh--Uh, nothing! Right, <FirstName>?
▶Mark
Heheh, it's, you know, guy talk.
  ▶Maki
Sounds dirty. But never mind that,
let's go, <FirstName>! C'mon!
  ▶Mark
Maki seems... pretty psyched about this.
▶Elly
......
  ▶Mark
Dammit! How come YOU get to go?
 ▶Nanjo
Careful. There's no knowing what may
happen inside.
▶Nanjo
Where are you going? We don't have
much time to spare, you know.
   ▶Maki
I'm happy not to be alone... Having you
and the others all here with me...!
 ▶Reiji
...You better not die in there. I still
want to spar with you sometime.
▶Reiji
You still ain't going?
 ▶Elly
Where're you going? I'll go wherever
you go, <FirstName>, but...
  ▶Elly
Where are you off to? I'll follow you
wherever you go, <FirstName>, but...
▶Elly
Watch yourself, <FirstName>...
I'll be waiting for you...
 ▶Elly
Please be careful, <FirstName>...
I'll be waiting for your safe return.
   ▶Brown
Say hi to the real Maki for us!
▶Brown
Huh? You haven't gone yet? Ohhh,
I get it... Got cold feet, huh?
   ▶Ayase
You haven't gone yet, <FirstName>?
Don't tell me you're chicken!
 ▶Ayase
You haven't gone yet, <Nickname>?
Don't tell me you're chicken!
 ▶Ayase

quick!
  ▶Ayase

quick!▶Agastya Tree

<FirstName>! This one's still alive!
Gimme a hand here!
 ▶Nanjo
We haven't time to waste here, <FirstName>!
It's too late for her, but not for us!
   ▶Mark
Yo, <FirstName>! The monsters are just
around the corner!
 ▶<Nickname>'s voice
Remember this? You left the poor woman
to die...
▶<Nickname>'s voice
"I'm looking out for number one"... Are
you sure that wasn't your reasoning?
  ▶<Nickname>'s voice
Remember this? You saved this woman,
heedless of your own safety...▶Maki
I've had enough! I don't want any
more deaths...
▶Maki
No one wants to die, right?
▶Maki
We can catch Kandori anytime. This man
needs our help!
   ▶<Nickname>'s voice
And here, you tried to abandon an old
man, though he was only a pawn...
▶<Nickname>'s voice
And here, you chose to save an old man
at the risk of losing Kandori...▶Harem Queen
I'll give you, and only you, one last
chance, <FirstName>...
▶Harem Queen
Which is better? My breathtaking
painting, or Maki's piece?
▶Harem Queen
And I want an honest answer!
  ▶<Nickname>'s voice
Did you really think that Chisato's
painting was superior...?
▶<Nickname>'s voice
Say, "I wasn't afraid of being turned
to stone." Can you say that honestly?
  ▶<Nickname>'s voice
Asserting one's beliefs in the face of
danger... it isn't easily done.▶Mark
But that voice... That's Maki's mom,
I'm dead sure...
▶Mark
Isn't it?
▶Mark
I don't know why she'd look like that,
but what if it really is her mom...?
▶Mark
Put your weapon away, <FirstName>!
   ▶<Nickname>'s voice
You lacked the vision to see through
to the truth...
▶<Nickname>'s voice
You judge only with your eyes, and fail
to see with your heart...
 ▶<Nickname>'s voice
You had vision enough to see through
to the truth...
▶<Nickname>'s voice
You see not only with your eyes, but
also with your heart...▶Kandori
You, boy... I haven't heard your answer
yet. What are you living for?
▶<Nickname>'s voice
This man's soul was sick with doubt...
▶<Nickname>'s voice
But you could not give his soul the
salvation it yearned for...
▶<Nickname>'s voice
And the cause was the doubt gnawing at
your own soul.
   ▶<Nickname>'s voice
This man's soul was sick with doubt...
▶<Nickname>'s voice
But you were able to soothe his soul's
torment...
▶<Nickname>'s voice
You could do this because your own soul
was free and clear of doubt.▶Maki
You know it, don't you, <FirstName>!?
You know I'm the worst girl alive!
  ▶<Nickname>'s voice
And what did you say to that?
▶<Nickname>'s voice
You couldn't tell her not to run, for
you too were running, weren't you?
▶<Nickname>'s voice
Can you look me in the eye and deny
that, self?
 ▶<Nickname>'s voice
You answered well. It's easy to run
from one's problems, yes...
▶<Nickname>'s voice
But the further you run, the more you
resent yourself. You know all too well.▶Trish
Hi! I'm Trish and this is my fountain
of healing!
▶Trish
This world runs on give-and-take! Give
me money and I'll take away your pain!
▶Trish
What do you say?ԙ
 ▶Trish
Okay!
  ▶Trish
Umm, with the going rate for healing...
And all of you put together...
 ▶Trish
It'll be ࿌,000 yen.
That's okay, right? 
  ▶Trish
Great! Then here goes!
Pain, pain, go away!
▶Trish
Phew... That should do it!
You're all good to go!
▶Trish
Need anything else? 
▶Trish
You don't have enough!? Boo to that!
There's nothing I hate like poor people!
▶Trish
Come back when your wallet's fuller.
Bye-bye!
▶Trish
Boo to that! You mangy, dirty bum!
Don't blame me if you wind up dead!
 ▶Trish
Well, come again. I'll be waiting!
Bye-bye!

I think you can handle it.

be fine. You're one strong guy.

......
  ▶Maki
Hold it right there! Where do you
think you're running off to?
▶Maki
There's nowhere left to hide!
 ▶Maki
Those countless bubbles... Each one,
a different person's consciousness...
▶Maki
People's minds are nothing more than
fragile bubbles born from this sea...
▶Maki
I was a consciousness that should never
have been born...
▶Maki
If you'd been born first, my life would
have turned out much differently...
▶Maki
Stop that! I don't want to hear that
kind of talk from my own mouth!
▶Maki
Did you ever try to change? How?
▶Maki
All you did was hide under the sheets
and cry!
▶Maki
But now's our chance! We can change
along with Masao, Kei, Reiji...

Now then, let's head to the school
and meet this Pandora.
  ▶Maki
They seem to have been pretty bored
while we were gone...
   ▶Mark
Yo <FirstName>, you didn't try anything
funny, did you?
   ▶Nanjo
What's the matter? Did something happen
inside?

Looks like you made it back in one
piece. When this is all over...

Oh, <FirstName>! It's good to have you
back... Are you hurt anywhere?

 ▶Mark
Hey Yosuke, what happened here? There's
no one around but you guys.
 ▶Yosuke
I'm not sure...
▶Yosuke
It was like this when we got back.
The east side of town's vanished, too.
▶Yosuke
I want to know what's going on just as
much as you do!
▶Nanjo
This must be the work of Pandora...
▶Chisato
Pandora?
 ▶Maki
I'm sorry, both of you...
▶Maki
I'm at fault for all of this... It's the
real reason behind everything...
  ▶Chisato
......
   ▶Yosuke
So that's it...
   ▶Maki
I promise I'll return everyone to their
original world.
▶Maki
I know there's no forgiving me for what
I did... but I'm really, really sorry.
▶Maki
If you want to hit me, Chisato, I'll
understand. Go right ahead.
   ▶Chisato
You're such an idiot, Maki!
▶Chisato
You're just as thick as you've always
been...
  ▶Yosuke
Hey, Chisato, c'mon...
▶Chisato
It's me who needs to apologize.
▶Chisato
You called me to this world because you
thought of me as your best friend, right?
▶Chisato
And I... I betrayed you...
▶Chisato
You've got it backwards, Maki. It's me
who needs your forgiveness...
  ▶Maki
Chisato... Thanks...
▶Chisato
Now go on. We'll wait here so we don't
get in your way.
▶Chisato
Once things settle down... let's all go
to an amusement park together!
▶Chisato
Sound good?
   ▶Maki
...Yeah.
▶Mark
An amusement park, huh? Heheh... Might be
fun to act like a kid again for a day.
▶Mark
So let's hurry up and get this done!
▶Nanjo
Maki, please open the door for us.
 ▶Maki
Will do!
▶Maki

Alright, let's go!

It's open! Let's go, everyone!

Alright! Time to do this thing!

Woo! Let's get going!
  ▶Maki
All my worst qualities are through this
door... I refuse to let them win!
   ▶Mark
This is finally it... Let's give it
everything we got, <FirstName>!
   ▶Nanjo
Hmm... These compacts may represent the
three primary colors of light.
▶Nanjo
One's heart can be any color, I suppose.
▶Nanjo
Which color all depends on one's self...
Perhaps that's the reasoning behind it.
   ▶Reiji
Hurry and go. I'll take out the small
fry for you.
 ▶Elly
It comes down to this... Let's end it
quickly and visit to the amusement park.
  ▶Elly
So this is it, huh? Let's hurry so we can
get to the amusement park quicker!

I want to ride the ferris wheel with you,
<FirstName>...

faceful of my Persona power!

ride the freefall!

much, but I'll be rooting for you guys.▶Agastya Tree
Young ones... Your presence is welcome.

Will you inscribe your story on me? 
   ▶Agastya Tree
Take care on your journey, young ones...▶Trish
Hi! I'm Trish and this is my fountain
of healing!
▶Trish
This world runs on give-and-take! Give
me money and I'll take away your pain!
▶Trish
What do you say?ԙ
 ▶Trish
Okay!
  ▶Trish
Umm, with the going rate for healing...
And all of you put together...
 ▶Trish
It'll be ৎ,000 yen.
That's okay, right? 
  ▶Trish
Great! Then here goes!
Pain, pain, go away!
▶Trish
Phew... That should do it!
You're all good to go!
▶Trish
Need anything else? 
▶Trish
You don't have enough!? Boo to that!
There's nothing I hate like poor people!
▶Trish
Come back when your wallet's fuller.
Bye-bye!
▶Trish
Boo to that! You mangy, dirty bum!
Don't blame me if you wind up dead!
 ▶Trish
Well, come again. I'll be waiting!
Bye-bye!
▶Trish
You called me out for no reason!?
Boo to that! Get outta here!▶Bizarre-looking man
My name is Igor... I am delighted to
make your acquaintance.
▶Igor
This place exists between dream and
reality, mind and matter...
▶Igor
It's been quite some time since we last
had a guest.
▶Igor
This is a room that only those bound by
a "contract" may enter...
▶Igor
From this day forth, you will be our
guest in this Velvet Room.
▶Igor
Your destiny will require you to hone
your power...
▶Igor
And for that, you will inevitably
require our help.
▶Igor
The Velvet Room is also known as the
room of Personas.
▶Igor
A Persona is a side of you that shows
itself when you face the world...
▶Igor
Think of it as a facade of protection
you wear to face hardships in life.
▶Igor
Hm... Perhaps that may have been rather
difficult to understand...
▶Igor
To battle opponents that cannot be
dealt with by human strength alone...
▶Igor
We in this room will lend you inhuman
power... the power of demons...
▶Igor
Now then. Allow me to explain my role
here...
▶Igor
I will assist you in giving birth to
new Personas.
▶Igor
The demons contained within the |ԏspell
cards|  you hold will be fused as one...
▶Igor
Thereby creating a new Persona.
▶Igor
Should you find yourselves with these
cards, please do bring them here.
  ▶Igor
Welcome to the Velvet Room...
   ▶Igor
What is it you desire?
▶Igor
Well then, what would you like
to know?Ԡ
   ▶Igor
I'm afraid you don't have enough |ԏspell
cards|  to give birth to a new Persona.
▶Igor
Alas, we cannot look after any more
Personas.
   ▶Igor
What would you like to do?Ԟ
▶Igor
Well then... Farewell...
▶Igor
If it's new Personas you want, I shall
fuse and create them for you.
▶Igor
First, though, I must summon demons to
fuse together into a Persona.
▶Igor
And for that, a certain type of card
is necessary.
▶Igor
You see, these cards are inscribed with
demon-summoning spells.
▶Igor
They are known as spell cards, and all
demons carry one.
▶Igor
Thus, in order to perform a fusion, I
will need you to gather spell cards.
▶Igor
Go forth, negotiate with demons,
and bring these spell cards back here.
▶Igor
Combat is not the only way to deal
with demons... Do you understand?
▶Igor
And not all demons are necessarily
wishing for a fight...
 ▶Igor
It isn't enough merely to fuse a new
Persona in order to make it your own...
▶Igor
There is rather more to it than that,
I'm afraid.
▶Igor
You must take a Persona onto yourself
in order to use its power.
▶Igor
Each of you is capable of holding up
to three Personas.
▶Igor
A newly-fused Persona will be entrusted
into my care.
▶Igor
By all means let me know when you
would like to take on new Personas.
▶Igor
But I can only look after 16 Personas
at a time, mind you.
▶Igor
There are as many Personas as there are
personalities... an infinite variety.
▶Igor
Each has its own form and substance,
to be used according to the situation.
▶Igor
If you can master that principle,
you will make a fine Persona-user.
▶Igor
Each of you can take on as many as
three Personas at once.
▶Igor
Of the three, only one can be actively
invoked during battle.
▶Igor
To invoke a Persona is to summon it
in combat.
▶Igor
The remaining two will remain on
standby...
▶Igor
Ready to be summoned forth at any time
during battle.
▶Igor
Different active Personas will grant
you different abilities.
▶Igor
Without the power of Persona, you are
no different than an ordinary human...
▶Igor
You will be powerless before the arcane
might of the demons' spells.
▶Igor
If by chance you were hit by a spell in
that state, you would be struck down.
▶Igor
But by taking on a Persona, your defense
against spells is considerably enhanced.
▶Igor
For some, it may also confer strength,
or increase luck for others.
▶Igor
This, too, is the power of Persona.
▶Igor
Though they are called Personas, each
is a hidden side of yourself.
▶Igor
I suggest you examine your status
carefully after summoning one.
▶Igor
That way, you can see which of your
qualities have changed.
▶Igor
At first, you will be unable to harness
your Persona's powers to the fullest.
▶Igor
But the more you invoke a Persona,
the more powers it will grant you.
▶Igor
As your Persona learns new skills, you
will have more options in battle.
▶Igor
Even if your Persona learns a powerful
skill, the SP required remains constant.
▶Igor
You will grow in combat, but do not
forget that your Personas grow as well.
▶Igor
Pardon me for being nosy, but...
▶Igor
Personas have eight levels of growth.
You should try to develop them fully.
▶Igor
I'm sure that there will be an ample
reward for doing so...
▶Igor
You might also be interested to know
about various factors in fusion.
▶Igor
For example, even when creating the
same Persona...
▶Igor
The combination of spell cards, the
affinities of the demons used...
▶Igor
The position of Terra and Luna, and any
essences added into the mix...
▶Igor
All of these factor into the resultant
Persona. And one more thing...
▶Igor
You may also add an item into the
fusion to trigger a change.
▶Igor
There are some items for which the
result is easily predictable...
▶Igor
But sometimes, even I will be unable
to guess at what may happen.
▶Igor
Should that come about, I do hope that
you'll pardon me.
▶Igor
But make no mistake, I do believe it
is worth trying...
▶Igor
I suggest gems for obtaining a higher-
or lower-ranked fusion within an Arcana.
▶Igor
As for the other items' effects, you
should experiment for yourself.▶Maki
This school and the people in it are
figments of the real me's imagination...
▶Maki
I'm not sure how to feel about that.
   ▶Mark
Sure is quiet here. I don't think
anyone's around.
  ▶Nanjo
The entrance to Avidya World is at
the library.
▶Reiji
My business with this school, this town,
was through when Kandori died...
▶Reiji
Or so I thought.
 ▶Elly
Do you like school, <FirstName>?
▶Elly
I... used to think it was boring.
But I'm getting to like it.
▶Elly
It's much easier now that I've met
you all...
▶Elly
Do you like school, <FirstName>?
▶Elly
I... used to consider it dull. But not
anymore, I don't think.
▶Elly
That's thanks to my friendship with you
and the others...
   ▶Brown
I actually really like school.
I'm a crappy student, though.
▶Brown
But hey, studying isn't everything!
   ▶Ayase
Do you like school, <FirstName>?
'Cause you know, I kinda do.
▶Ayase
Most of the time, I get to do whatever
I want here.
▶Ayase
Do you like school, <Nickname>?
'Cause you know, I kinda do.
▶Ayase
Most of the time, I get to do whatever
I want here.▶Gargantuan monster
Shh... Sssshhhhhhhrrrr...
 ▶Maki
Another me!? So... this is Pandora!
 ▶Nanjo
Look! Is that the core of the
Deva System behind it!?
  ▶Pandora
It was inevitable, I suppose, that
you'd make it here... Sss... Hhhrrr...
▶Pandora
This... is the gate to paradise...
And I won't... ssshhrr... give it up...
▶Pandora
I'll use it to create my paradise...
A place where nothing exists...
▶Maki
No! That's no "gate to paradise"
at all!
▶Maki
It's a Pandora's box that will bring
evil to this world!
▶Pandora
Fsshhhrrr... Everything is useless...
Utterly useless. You... me... useless.
▶Pandora
These things... I do not need...
Now begone from me... Fsssshrrrraaaa!▶Agastya Tree
Young ones... Your presence is welcome.
 ▶Agastya Tree
Will you inscribe your story on me? 
   ▶Agastya Tree
Take care on your journey, young ones...▶Pandora
Why won't you give in? How...
How can you be so strong!?
 ▶Maki
You already know, don't you?
▶Reiji
It's 'cause we're not alone.
   ▶Elly
Because we work not as individuals,
but as a team.
  ▶Elly
Because we're not here alone...
We're all here together.
▶Brown
It's because we work together.
 ▶Ayase
We're not alone!
   ▶Mark
Heheh... That, and we believe in
ourselves.
 ▶Nanjo
People can't live in isolation. If
things are hard, just look around.
▶Nanjo
We'll be there for you.
  ▶Maki
You and me... We're both part of
Maki Sonomura. These are our friends.
▶Maki
Let's end this... together.
   ▶Pandora
Thank you...
 ▶Nanjo
At last... it's over.
  ▶Mark
Yeah...
 ▶Maki
Thank you... all of you. We have to
part ways now...
▶Maki
But I'll never forget you all.
  ▶Mark
Hey! Whaddaya mean, part ways...?
   ▶Maki
I'm only a shadow of Maki Sonomura.
I can't go with you...
▶Maki
It was fun... Really, it was.
 ▶Mark
Hey! Maki...! That's not fair!
Whoa!
▶Maki
I'll send you all back to the real
world...
 ▶Maki
But first, could I borrow you for a
second, <FirstName>?
  ▶Maki
Thanks... I hope you'll think about me
sometimes...
▶Maki
But I have to go... I love you.
  ▶♁⏞⛋碏
......
  ▶Maki
Goodbye, everyone...
Goodbye, <FirstName>...▶Maki
Guess what? <FirstName> is...
Or at least that's what I heard!
▶Elly
Is that so? Oh, my... Hee-hee!
  ▶Elly
Really? No kidding! Hee-hee!
▶Nanjo
Tsk... People do like to talk, but
nothing's noisier than girls gossiping.
 ▶Maki
Oh! Speak of the devil.
▶Maki
You're late! We were getting tired of
waiting around.
▶Mark
Sorry, guys... Man, that was hell.
▶Mark
<FirstName> and me lost our second buttons
on the way here!
▶Mark
Those girls were all over us... We had
to surrender the buttons to survive.
▶Mark
There was a bunch of people looking for
you too, Nanjo.
   ▶Nanjo
"A wise man never courts danger."
Use your head, man.
  ▶Mark
Yeah, yeah, if you say so...
▶Elly
It must be difficult for you all,
being so popular...
   ▶Elly
Wow, being popular seems rougher than
I thought.
▶Maki
Well, I hate to break it to you, but
you're hanging out with us next!
   ▶Elly
Let's go! Time waits for no man,
you know.
  ▶Elly
C'mon! We're not getting any younger!
   ▶Mark
Aw, man, there they go...
▶Mark
Heheh... Looking at Maki now, that
mess before seems like a bad dream...
   ▶Nanjo
Heh. Pandora, eh...?
   ▶Mark
Man, you're still stuck on that?
▶Nanjo
Oh, it's nothing. I only just remembered
the last thing in Pandora's box...
▶Nanjo
Well then, Mark, shall we go?
  ▶Mark
What do you mean?
▶Mark
Wait a sec, did you just call me Mark?
Hey!
▶Ayase
Seriously!? <Nickname>!?
That's totally awesome!
▶Ayase
Seriously!? <FirstName>!?
You really think so?
   ▶Ayase
Huh... <Nickname> I could see,
but Masao?
   ▶Ayase
Huh... <FirstName> I could see,
but Masao?
   ▶Ayase
Remember the promise, <Nickname>?
We're gonna ride the freefall 10 times!
▶Ayase
Over and over until we hurl!
  ▶Ayase
Remember the promise, <FirstName>?
We're gonna ride the freefall 10 times!
▶Ayase
Over and over until we hurl!▶Mark
Huh? After all that bitching, you
decided to show up anyway?
▶Reiji
Heheh...
   ▶Nanjo
What in the... You're behaving rather
strangely today.
 ▶Reiji
Masao... They tell me you hate heights.
▶Mark
Wh-Who told you that!?
  ▶Reiji
Hidehiko was telling anyone who'd listen.
Something about this being the last...
▶Reiji
I came to get a good look at you,
screaming in terror.
▶Nanjo
Indeed? That does sound like something
worth witnessing...
▶Nanjo
I believe I'll stay around to observe
as well.
  ▶Mark
That dick! He's always doing stuff
like this!
▶Mark
What're you laughing about!?
▶Mark
Look, there's no way I'm going!
Forget it!
 ▶Maki
Sorry to keep you waiting! Huh...?
What's wrong, guys?
  ▶Nanjo
Ah, Maki, <FirstName>.
Perfect timing.
▶Nanjo
It seems Masao's cancelling today's
plans. Such a pity...
 ▶Maki
Huh!? How come? I was really looking
forward to it...
   ▶Mark
Nanjo, you evil...!
 ▶Reiji
Heh heh heh...
 ▶Maki
Is he telling the truth, Masao?
 ▶Mark
N-No way... Um... I'm... I'm goin'.
 ▶Maki
Yay! Chisato and the others are waiting
outside! C'mon, everyone, let's go!
 ▶Mark
Nanjo... Reiji...! You guys are gonna
pay for this!
 ▶Reiji
Heh... Looking at Maki now, what
happened before is like a bad dream.
  ▶Nanjo
Heh. Pandora, eh...?
   ▶Reiji
Don't tell me you're still thinking
about all that.
▶Nanjo
Oh, it's nothing. I only just remembered
the last thing in Pandora's box...
▶Nanjo
Well then, <FirstName>, shall we go?
 ▶Reiji
Hey, what did you mean by that?
▶Maki's voice
Hurry up, <FirstName>!
▶Mark
Hey, looks like Mr. Smellypants
is here.
▶Brown
Heheh... Laugh it up, chump. Today's
the last day you get to call me that!
▶Brown
You're not too fond of heights, are you,
Massy? Or should I say, Mr. Dampcrotch?
▶Mark
What the--Who told you that, you
bastard!?
  ▶Brown
Mwahaha... Your mom gave me every last
detail!
▶Brown
My, my, how shameful for a sixth-
grader...
 ▶Mark
That stupid cow!
▶Mark
Can it, okay? It's better than crapping
your pants in junior high!
  ▶Brown
Well technically, sixth grade's part
of junior high, too... Heheheh.
▶Brown
I'm gonna get a good look at a return
performance by Mr. Dampcrotch today!
▶Nanjo
Those nitwits... Where do they think
they are!? Ugh, they give me a headache.
▶Maki
Sorry to keep you waiting! Huh...?
What's wrong, guys?
▶Brown
<Nickname>! Maki! Perfect timing.
▶Brown
Mark here wanted to tell you how
excited he is to ride the freefall!
  ▶Maki
Ooh, really? Then let's get going!
  ▶Mark
Hidehiko, you dick...!
  ▶Brown
Heeheehee...
   ▶Maki
What's wrong? C'mon, let's go! Chisato
and the others are waiting outside!
  ▶Mark
Hidehiko...! I'll get you!
  ▶Brown
Man, I can't wait to see this.
▶Brown
But check out Maki... Makes the stuff
that happened seem like a bad dream.
  ▶Nanjo
Heh. Pandora, eh...?
   ▶Brown
Sorry, what?
▶Brown
Man, you're bringing that up now?
Cruel as ever, huh...?
  ▶Nanjo
Oh, it's nothing. I only just remembered
the last thing in Pandora's box...
▶Nanjo
Well then, <FirstName>, shall we go?
 ▶Brown
Huh? What's that supposed to mean?
Hey, wait up!▶Agastya Tree
