   I can't do much for you, but I promise
our time together will be exciting.
So c'mon, lend me your strength!
Humans live the way they want, right?
It would be nice if you could put aside
our differences and help me out.
 Ahahahahaha!
I can only do so much on my own.
So I'd like your help!
   Many artists have been captivated by you.
I don't see why, though!
 Hey, how can I get power like yours?
I really, really want it...
   Are you Maki Sonomura?
I could tell right off! You have a unique
aura about you...
 Hmm... I think your mother's grandpa is
your guardian angel. He's really strong!
   Want to know the truth? The ones behind
all this... are really aliens. Or not!
 If you do what I say, by some miracle
a bronze statue of you will be erected!
  I got lost and wandered here...
Please forgive me!
 A-A human! D-Don't come near me!
   Ahahahahaha!
Please... spare me!
   So you're a human? So what! C'mon, baby,
let's play a symphony of love!
Bullshit!
  Oh no... oh..
 Heeheehee! You and me could have some
good times together!
 Alright, what's the difference between
a rottweiler and a poodle? They're two
totally different breeds! Get it?
Hell no, Hidehiko! You're not going to
make me mimic something that awful,
are you? Have a heart!
  Sheesh... You're really going to make me
mimic a weapons-grade joke like that...?
  What do you do if you're on a horse and
you see a giraffe and lion next to you?
Get off the carousel! C'mon, laugh!
How've you been? I heard you're on
a roll. Not me, it's been pretty slow.
  Man, it's hot out! I like summer, but
not this kind of... Ugh, screw this!
 So, got any crushes? Yeah, there's been
someone on my mind, too. Heeheehee...
.. Urrrrgh... *puke*
That surprised you, didn't it!?
 BOO!
Heh, you fell for it.
...Just kidding, moron!
 Dude... I can't possibly mimic something
like that... What should I do?
This is just a down payment. Do you want
land? Stocks? Hmph! I'll give you a photo
of myself!
  I refuse!
  I'll give you a coin whose front and back
are reversed. I even signed it.
  Are you happy with your station in life?
That way is the epitome of foolishness!
I'll grasp true happiness on my own!
  Hell no!
   The masses must act, or their station in
life will never change!
   You're an utter imbecile!
But don't worry about it.
I've never known such a dunce!
You think you're a match for me!?
   Hmph... What a cretin...
   Your egotism is... stunning.
   There's definitely no comparison between
demons and your kind.
 I know...

 I'm actually a prince of the human world,

   Ah, my dear child... Masao Inaba!
Ugh, va te faire foutre!
 I'm in this amazing demon form 'cause I
got cursed!
If you see 11:11:11 on the clock on three
straight days, the door won't open!
  Oh my God...
   Heheh... I know that's not true.
   > <Name> sang a chic, touching
American bossa nova.
 I'm not as bad a singer as you!
How rude!
  Oh, this is wonderful! Thank you for
singing that lovely song just for me.
 There, there, little Eriko... Play nice.
   Yes? Would you like some milk?
...I can't keep this up!
Heehee...That's a dear.
You're a very capable human. Won't you
take on a job as my bodyguard?
  What did you just say...?
I refuse.
Ahahah... What should I do?
I may have a smart mouth, but I'm really
a good girl!
  It smells kind of funny around here!
And that style is like, PRE-prehistoric!
What a dork!
 You're seriously willing to be seen
outside looking like that?
 Ooooh, my chest is sore...
Maybe if you gave it a little rub...?
   Hey! Don't make that face!
 Y'know... I'm usually really innocent...
But today? I'm feeling daring.
My daddy was abducted by a UFO... My mom
joined an evil cult...Now I've been taken
apart and put back together as a cyborg...
  Won't someone buy my matches...? If I
don't sell any, Papa will beat me...
 I'm the oldest of 23 brothers and
sisters... I have to eat them all...
 I'd watch out if I were you... I'm nice
and calm now, but I go nuts in a snap.
 You're not gonna do what I say!? Don't
make me blow your brains out!
   My hobby is collecting severed demon
heads...
  Hmph! It's true what they say...
A human's bark is worse than its bite!
You'll be calling ME a demon soon.
 Who the hell do you think you're talking
to? I hate rudeness worse than anything!
  Y'know, I've been thinking about the
difference between humans and demons...
And it's useless. There isn't any.
It's better to stay in bed than to go
through life half-assed. There's too
many people like that already.
  Your actions have no worth.
I'm so smart!
  Stay quiet for once and listen to what
others have to say! And don't you make
fun of them, or I'll make you regret it!
 Stop whining... No one likes it...
 Haha... who knows?
 ......
 .........
 ......
 This isn't your lucky day... I'll take
your eyes last... So go to hell!
Sounds like you wanna die!
 Leave me alone...
  Rrrrrwwaaaaaoooarrr!
   Grrrwaaaaaaaaaaaah!
   Wow!
   ...So what?
I spin the top with the power of my
chi alone...
   You're exceptionally talented. I'm going

 You already have my card... I have no
further interest in you.
 Take this...
   ...I see...
You can't use it...
You're too weak to have it...
  Then take this, at least...
Well then, it's time for us to part...
 This is good for you. Take it...
   I'll be going now...
   It doesn't seem right, giving you a
double's card, but feel free to make
a Persona or whatever...
  It seems I still need more training...
Let us meet again after I've had more
training as a double...
   I'll be going my own way now. There's
someone else whose double I have to be!
  I'm off to be someone else's double...
Here, take this and keep on trying!
 I enjoyed that. It would be a waste for
you to come away with nothing...
So please accept my card as a memento!
   If you weren't satisfied, feel free to
throw the card away! I won't mind at all!
   I'm not allowed to fight you...
It's because I'm your double...
And you are mine...
It's natural for doubles to merge
together as one... I'll give you
my card...
  I can't fight you... I'm your double,
after all...
 Here... a gift from your alter ego...
I'd like you to take it...
   Ironically, as your double, I know all
too well that I cannot escape...
I also know that you'll spare my life
if I give you my card...
 Yo, ข! How's it goin'?
Let's get down to negotiations!
 Yo ข, how you been? You got
anything for your alter ego?
  For a guy who's my double, you don't
stand out much... Shall we settle for
good which of us is the true self?
  So you're my alter ego...? I'll make you
pay for being a killjoy!
 How ominous to encounter my own double...
  I had a bad feeling about this...
but then, you are my double...
   I never thought I'd meet my alter ego.
It really is a small world...
   If you're my double, I don't need to be
shy! Gimme something!
 The moon shall be our witness... Let us
determine who is the true ข...
So if you're me, you should be able
to grant this request of mine...
 The new moon is in the sky, and you're
not afraid... That's the difference
between you and me...
  You're trying to negotiate with your
double? Well, give me something, and
maybe I can put my feelings aside...
   Hello, ข!
I am ขtoo!
It's amazing, but true!
  Hello, ข!
I am ขtoo!
Give me a memento of our meeting!
   Ah! I had an uneasy feeling about this...
So you were my double. I wonder if this,
too, is fate...
I'm in a very foul mood... As my double,
couldn't you give me something?
 You certainly don't stand out much for
someone who's my double. Let's see once
and for all who the true self is!
  If you're my double, then there's no need
for modesty! Give me a gift!
   You're my double...? I don't know about
this... How is it going to end...?
If you're my double, I may as well ask...
Give me something.
 ...I thank you, as your double, for the
chance to experience something so rare...
Tell me what you desire.
 ...Absurd! I don't want to share my
experiences as a double with you!
Of all the nerve!
You're a dreadful thing... Not even I,
your double, can understand...
  ...It was pleasant, the time I spent as
your double. I quite enjoyed it!
   It wasn't so remarkable an experience,
being your double... but oh well.
Tell me what you want.
You're a dreadful thing... Not even I,
your double, can understand...
Still... you did pique my curiosity...
Tell me what you desire...
   ...It was pleasant, the time I spent as
your double. I quite enjoyed it!
I thank you for the chance to experience
something so rare... If I can grant you
anything, I will.
   ...I've never felt this way before in my
time as a double... What could it mean?
   On the whole, that was delightful...
But it was so childish, I question
whether it was even worth it!
  My encounter with you gave me a small
taste of the unknown... I'm in awe.
  I request... <Amount> yen...
  I appreciate your understanding of
a double's needs.
   I have no intentions of becoming a
poor person's alter ego!
...What did you use all that money on?
I'm not impressed by your wasteful ways.
I have no intentions of becoming a
stingy person's alter ego!
  You don't understand the terror of a
double... But you'll realize it someday.
  Well then, my request is...
one life stone.
I appreciate your understanding of
a double's needs.
   I have no intentions of being the alter
ego of a fool who doesn't even carry
any life stones!
  What did you use the life stones on...?
I'm not impressed by your wasteful ways.
   I have no intentions of becoming a
stingy person's alter ego!
  You don't understand the terror of a
double... But you'll realize it someday.
  Well then, my request is...
a ...
 I appreciate your understanding of
a double's needs.
   You don't have any.
You'll come to know the terror of
a double!
What a strong will! You're truly worthy
of being my double!
Well then, my request is...
some of your energy.
   No one knows how delicious your energy
is more than your alter ego...
  You're rejecting me? Me, your double!?
You fool of an alter ego!
   You're rejecting me? Me, your double!?
I don't understand...
   You're rejecting me? Me, your double!?
I don't understand...
