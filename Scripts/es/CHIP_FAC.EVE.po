"> Krypto Chip Specifications\n"
"Certification No: 00345KU808BJ\n"
"Ver: 2.5\n"
"{FF03}{FF02}The Krypto Chip is a new CPU Chip designed\n"
"by Kadokura and Algon Soft.\n"
"{FF03}{FF02}It boasts tremendous processing power and\n"
"reduced power usage, but its key feature is\n"
"the ability to accumulate souls.\n"
"{FF03}{FF02}The Krypto Chip's ability to harvest souls\n"
"and the accumulation cycle is as follows.\n"
"{FF03}{FF02}Inside the Krypto Chips are living elements\n"
"called \"Spores\".\n"
"{FF03}{FF02}These Spores spawn images with the ability\n"
"to capture souls. They are known as\n"
"\"Carriers\".\n"
"{FF03}{FF02}Carriers are a lifeform with both\n"
"electromagnetic and spiritual properties,\n"
"allowing them to travel through the net.\n"
"{FF03}{FF02}When a Carrier captures a soul, it will\n"
"instinctively return to the parent body\n"
"through an internet connection.\n"
"{FF03}{FF02}Spore -> Carrier -> Net -> Parent.\n"
"This is the soul accumulation cycle the\n"
"Krypto Chip uses.\n"
"{FF03}{FF02}The following set-up appears to be the most\n"
"optimal way of implementing the\n"
"soul accumulation process.\n"
"{FF03}{FF02}Supply every household with a machine with a\n"
"Krypto Chip and have all of them connect to\n"
"the internet.\n"
"{FF03}{FF02}Humans using the PC will eventually have\n"
"their souls harvested by the Carriers, and\n"
"those souls will be taken to the parent body.\n"
"{FF03}{FF02}This plan will allow the parent body to\n"
"absorb a massive amount of souls with\n"
"minimal time and effort.\n"
"{FF03}{FF02}Humans who have had their souls harvested\n"
"will end up in a catatonic, lifeless state.\n"
"{FF03}{FF02}This concludes the summary of Krypto Chip's\n"
"specifications and our plans for it.\n"
