Raidou felt the presence of a strong demon from beyond the door.  Go inside? Yes Raidou opened the door and went inside.  Raidou decided not to go inside.  Raidou left. Looks like we need to do something about that seal. According to that voice, we need  inside the Matrix Labyrinth.  The power of the jewel has melted the seal away...  Raidou found himself in a strange world. Is this that Matrix Labyrinth the voice was yammering about? We might have walked into his trap on purpose, but we'll still need to stay on our toes.  A strange wall is blocking the way.  The gate cannot be entered from this side.  Raidou was unable to pass through the gate.  Unearthly lights are swirling around...  Touch them? Yes Raidou passed through.  Raidou decided not to touch them.  It's a mysterious switch that seems susceptible to fire attacks.  Destroy it? Yestemp message temp message temp message  It's a mysterious switch that seems susceptible to force attacks.  Destroy it?  It's a mysterious switch that seems susceptible to ice attacks.  Destroy it?  It's a mysterious switch that seems susceptible to lightning attacks.  Destroy it?  It's a mysterious switch that seems susceptible to power attacks.  Destroy it?  There's something on the ground.

You can get through this way. It's a one-way entrance, though. There's some sorta trick to this wall... Oh, fiddlesticks. I can't find my glasses anywhere. Every one of these darn passages looks the same to me. I just can't see a thing without my glasses... Ohh, this is the living end! In all my years, I've never seen anything so frustrating! Everywhere I go, it's walls, walls, walls! Who designed this tacky labyrinth? Honestly! If you ask me, somebody needs to be disciplined. Whoa! You're a normal joe, right? Naw, man, I didn't mean it like that. I just saw this weird red guy zip past at warp speed. That red cape of his was far out, though. I'll gank it next time he comes around. Whoa! Oh, wait... it's just a black one. You just ran by me a little while ago, but it was a red you. Are you like, the rare black variant? Hey, did you see a far-out red guy? I dunno if he's a man or a demon, but he looked wicked cool in that red cape. He's made himself scarce, though. Is he your bud or something? Hee ho... Have you seen-ho my friend, hee ho? We're playing hee-and seek, ho. But, I can't find my friend, ho... D-Did they go hee-home without me, hee-ho!? I'm lonely, ho... Hee ho!

We're after Kiyoshi, the younger one. Got it? That's right. Good detective work, . I certainly hope this is a dumb joke I don't get. There's no way a Kuzunoha could be this loopy. This is Kiyoshi's cane, which means... ...he's probably in the factory. Let's check it out.  Raidou obtained . *gasp* ...! ...Don't scare me like that, Raidou! I didn't expect to see you here. ...Huh? What I'M doing here? Didn't Shouhei tell you? This is going to be my big cover story! Remember I asked you to look into that Red Cape mystery? Well, guess what! He's been seen near this factory, too. Actually finding the monster who's been spotted all over town... What a scoop! Don't worry, I came prepared. ...Except maybe I got a bad tip. I've been here for a while; so far, I haven't seen hide or hair of Red Cape. It was awful nice of you to come all this way just to help me though, Raidou. Wh-What!? Those dolls... They're f-f-floating! Ohhh......  Tae collapsed on the floor. *sigh* Kind of hard to cover the story when you're unconscious, Tae... ...All that aside, don't these dolls look familiar, ? You're that detective from the Daidouji Residence, aren't you? If you're looking for Kiyoshi, he's in the back room. However, I obviously won't let you get to him that easily. The key to breaking that seal is hidden inside my Matrix Labyrinth. If you want to meet Kiyoshi, you'll need to find all ! This time you'll get a taste of my power, along with the teachings of Kimon Tonkou!  A strange pattern appeared on the door. Should you fail to get out alive, I'll take care of the lady for you. Heh heh heh...  The voice can no longer be heard. It's a trap. What do you suppose he meant by labyrinth? ...And what's the scoop on these weird dolls? Whatever's gone on, we need to find Kiyoshi. Let's go, .  Tae is unconscious. ! It's a Red Cape! ...M-My wife's pregnant... I've got three kids... N-No job... No m-money... Can't... go on... I've GOT NOTHING LEFT! ...What are you doing here? This place is off-limits to non- employees... Ugh... What gives? Ugh... I'm achin' all over... I guess he doesn't remember being the Red Cape. Oh, I get it! You were playing detective and snuck in. I used to do that when I was younger. But, stay out of the warehouse. The company president is in there and you'd get into trouble. Why don't you run along home and help your dad around the house? I need to get back to work. See ya, kid. Sounds like we're heading for the warehouse, .  The Red Cape reverted to his true, human form. ...B-But, all I wanted to do... ...was save the factory... ...You're that detective! Did you come here after me? ...It's about time. I'm going to tell you everything... About my brother... and my niece... ......!? I see you made it through the Matrix Labyrinth relatively unscathed. Not bad at all, detective... I mean, Devil Summoner. But, you're still no match for me! ...As I am the great Dark Summoner, ! I trust that you've heard of me before... Of course.Ho ho ho... It is good to be famous, yes? That was the correct answer. So, allow me a moment to answer some of YOUR questions... What!? ...And you call yourself a Devil Summoner!? ...Tch. Children today are so ignorant of history. Well, putting that aside, I'm sure there are things you've been wondering about for some time. ...A pity you'll die without any answers. All right, here's everything I know about Kiyoshi Daidouji... ...his transformation, which you refer to as Red Cape... ...and the object that was expelled from his body. . It's a monster that grows by feeding on a person's fears and anxiety. As the Hiruko grows, it slowly alters its host's body. So you see, the monster you call Red Cape is just a Hiruko in an advanced state! Once it grows stronger, the Hiruko moves to the next step. ...Which is what you just saw. A fully grown Hiruko leaves its host and enters the next phase of the project. I'm sure you'd like to know what project I'm talking about... But, I can't tell you anything more about it. There's something to be said for following a client's orders. I'm not at liberty to give away much just yet. But, there is something I can tell you about Kaya, the girl you've been looking for. She also plays an important role in the project. You can try as long as you like, but we won't let you have her. ...I should stop, though. Wouldn't want to say too much. I'm a busy man; I need to be on my way. Don't worry, I'll leave someone behind to keep you company. Farewell, Raidou Kuzunoha! ...Aaarrrgghhh! Talk about tragedy... He can't even die as a human. ...Mr. Daidouji! Are you alright, Sir? ...Ohhhh... If it wasn't for you, we never woulda had money to feed our kids! We'd rather the factory never went bankrupt... but we all appreciate the opportunities you gave us! You've gotta hang in there! ...Y-You guys...! Mr. Daidouji! Can you hear us!? We're taking you straight to the hospital!  The factory workers rushed Kiyoshi to the hospital. He'd gotten to know his employees so well that they actually saved his life... This case seems just about closed for the moment, . , don't you have something for him?  Raidou handed the cuff link to Kiyoshi... ...Th-This is... ...It's my brother's. Why do you... have this?  Raidou explained the situation to Kiyoshi. My brother and I fought over this... a long time ago... You're giving it... to me, Takeshi? You forgave me...? ...Raidou. I'd thrown my life away, but... thanks to you, I can have hope. I don't need this anymore... I want you to have it.  Raidou obtained an . I did something terrible to Kaya... Please... You have to help her... ... About that Rasputin piker... ...and his Hiruko business. We can't really ignore something that serious. Besides, it sounded like he knew where Kaya was... Think maybe we should run all this by Narumi? I don't know what came over me. Why didn't I press the shutter that time? Well, I'm still young. Even the  great Kichou Asakura makes mistakes now and then. Discontent regarding one's environment manifests as the self yearning to meld with idolized objects. Discontent is not a priori a bad thing. By channelling it in a positive direction, it can be transformed into sublimation. People warring over territory... Past, present, and future; some things will never change. Disputing one another's claims will get them nowhere. Don't you want to see what that boy will do? Abandoning one's desire for the sake of others... Life imitates the means used to overcome the obstacles before one's eyes. The child's decision is a folly that can be viewed as the abandonement of life itself. Ever since that weird doll showed up, I can't leave the factory. ...I've gotten used to it. Too bad I'm gonna die here, though. Don't give up!...Mr. Daidouji always used to encourage me when I made a mistake. ...And if you got here from outside, there must still be hope. Alright. I'll keep at it. Say what you want, it doesn't matter. Go ahead, keep yelling at me until we're both dead if that makes you happy. I'm going to die here...  The factory worker walked off with hope sparkling in his eyes. Th-The doll s-s-spoke... And then, I... I started going around in circles... You can get out of this.B-But, that doll! Th-That talking doll! ...You're right. Mr. Daidouji always said not to panic in times of trouble... You came here from outside, right? Okay... Then, there has to be a way out! Y-Yeah! I'm all right, now! How long must I keep wandering this place...  The factory worker regained his composure and walked away. Dammit! What's with that stupid doll!? It's driving me crazy! How about a stiff drink?...Yer still just a student. You aren't old enough to think about stuff like that. Heh... just like Mr. Daidouji, who used to take me to bars even though he wouldn't drink himself. Yeah, blowing a gasket won't do me any good... I should take it easy. What!? I AM cooled down! Don't go around judging people! What the hell am I supposed to do!?  The factory worker walked off with a smile on his face. Nobody warned me about that odd doll... I just came here to pick up my things... Let's think of a way out.Look, this isn't my problem. I just want to pick up my things and go. ...You remind me a bit of Mr. Daidouji. He's always willing to help, even when he's swamped with work. I can't take favors from someone so much younger than me. I can manage it myself... I knew coming here was a mistake...  The factory worker walked away with a confident grin. If I don't save us all from that demon doll, who else is going to do it!? It's too difficult for you.I won't know unless I try! ...I'm the only hope this factory has left! ...But, what am I supposed to do? ...Mr. Daidouji said something like that when he asked us to leave the factory... But... I like it here! How could anyone sit back and watch as something they love is taken away!? I won't die... ...and neither will this factory! I'm going to protect this factory!  The factory worker skipped off in high spirits. Hey there, Raidou. Looks like you've been busy lately. The Daidouji Residence, Ginza-Cho, this here factory... Incidents just follow in your wake, huh? You're a regular walking crime scene. There's no hard evidence... Ya can't trust those workers's testimony. I got no clue what to do about this...  Detective Kazama's spirit was rekindled. Don't get any ideas about outwitting the police! We're the ones who're gonna protect the Capital! Not some private eye! I hate doing busywork. I've gotta run all over the place, for no reason at all... Maybe I should just throw 'em all in the slammer. You too, for good measure! ...... ...Wha--!? Oh! It's you, Raidou! Hey, you really look different. You look like a man now. ...I used to be the leader of the local gang of punks. But, now I'm sporting this cherry blossom crest, workin' on the side Even though I'm using cuffs instead of my fists, I still hate crooked people. I decided to become a flatfoot cause I can be myself... with what little brains I got. You've got the same eyes I did when I was young: reckless, yet straightforward. ...Take this, will ya? When you get to be my age, make sure to keep that sparkle in your eyes.  Raidou obtained the . I went to Fukagawa-Cho to ask around the neighborhood... At Daikoku-Yu, the men of the Kantou Haguro-gumi just glared at me... I was scared to tears! When talking to the Kantou Haguro- gumi men, I didn't catch half the jargon flying out of their mouths. It felt like I was talking to foreigners. The lady reporter that was unconscious there went home, if that's what you're asking. She must've slipped on those high heels and hit her head, right? Those things are dangerous. When I helped that reporter up, she gave me her business card. I tried to politely decline, but she wasn't having any of that. She forced it into my hand. I took the testimony of the incident from the workers inside, but... Every last one of them said a doll began speaking to them. I can't write that on my report. I'd be a laughingstock. This whole area is our base. I found it the other day! Look, I'm just like Satake! I don't need Dad... Look, I'm just like Satake! I can't wait to show Dad... A base! We have a base! Hip hip, hooray! I've got a lackey too, so I don't get lonely in this huge place... I don't get it... I have a base, so why am I so lonely? My lackey and that lady are watching me! I have to be strong, like Satake... What's up with him...? This is our base! I'm finally just like Satake... So, would Satake do at a time like this? ...It stinks, but I gotta scram now. I don't know what that guy is gonna do. A Boss has gotta protect his lackeys. I know that's what Satake would do...  The wannabe kid's spirit was rekindled. I got a base AND a lackey! Now I'm just like Satake! My place is bigger than Satake's bathhouse! Ain't it great!? I'm a Boss now, so I don't need any grown-ups--not even Dad! I don't give a rip if Dad's not around! I'm a Boss now! I have my lackey! That lady is watching? Hey lady, ain't I just like Satake!? Everything here is part of our base! It's bigger than Satake's whole bathhouse! Grown-ups are so selfish! This is OUR base! ...On the other hand, my lackey is getting scared... In a situation like this, what would Satake do? I could take that guy in a fight, easy! But, Dad told me real men don't fight... I'm Lackey #1. ...What's a lackey? A lackey is there to obey the Boss. ...I don't get it. The Boss looks out for his lackeys. That's what Boss said. ...What's a lackey? Boss keeps looking at that lady... The scary man over there shouted at us. Shut up! he said. Boss... I'm scared...  The pure and innocent girl's spirit was rekindled. What's lackey? I don't know what that word means! I don't know, and I don't care! As long as Boss plays with me! I don't like stuck-up people, but I'll obey him if he plays with me! I'll obey every order! I don't know what boss or lackey even means! But, being a lackey is fun! Being with Boss is fun! Hey, what's with Boss? He's been staring at that lady all day! When I grow up, I'm going to be as pretty as her too! That man shouting was even louder than us! ...So, I was scared. Whooer you? I claimed dis joint first. I finally founda place ta get outta da rain. I ain't budging an inch. What're you, homeless too?  Sorry mac, but dis's my place. Aww, I ain't heartless.

A battleship transformed and is stomping all over? Ya mean, transform like this...? ...Feh, it's no good. I ain't had a bite to eat... Dat battleship can get up, but not me. Huh!? You're launchin' a rocket? That thing by da river? Whaddaya gonna do about fuel? Can't move onna empty stomach, ya know... Where dere's a will, dere's a way, eh? If you don't gotta place to come back ta, come on down 'ere. I'm tireda sittin' around all by my lonesome, y'know.  The resting bum's thoughts can be heard... ...The poor girl was in tears. Perhaps I was being excessively childish... Well, they do have a home to return to... I hope they don't resent me for this. Now that I think on it, when I was a lad his age, I made an abandoned storefront my base. Mother yelled at me because I was absorbed in my play and didn't come home for dinner... When I was at that tender age, I never dreamed of riding the train unsupervised... I was always with Mother, then. Children today are so bold... Martial law... Oh dear, are those children unharmed? I should never have sent them on their way... But, bygones are bygones. My apologies, children. This is most out of hand! A-Are the children all right? I should never have sent them on their way... But, bygones are bygones. A thousand apologies! Reflecting on it now... It was more cheerful with those children around... Should they grace me with their presence again... Perhaps I shall feign sleeping.  The factory worker walked away.  It's a Dragon Cave.

A cat has needs...  It's a break room for the servants.   senses something from the cabinet in the back...  Check the cabinet?   obtained  x1.   left. ... do you feel that? There's a funny draft in here that I didn't feel anywhere else. Let's check every nook and cranny in here. I think we're on to something.  Originally the Volt-order demon uses the skillInspect here. However, since the game is underdeveloped, assume the Inspect is done beforehand. But make sure to have a Volt-order demon before you proceed.  Inspect is a skill which glows a place where's suspicious. Assume that the Inspect is done, in addition, the book shelf and the wall in the back are glowing.  It's a big bookshelf.  Classic literature is lined up on the shelves.  There are antiques placed on the floor.  There are drawings and antiques placed on the floor.  Raidou examined the wainscot.  There are scrape marks on the side of the wainscot. . Looks like this wainscot is hiding something. Let's use  to find the trick to moving the wainscot.  demons can Inspect things. Let's use a Volt-order demon's power.  First, summon a Volt-order demon.  Press the R1 button to open the menu, then choose Inspect.  When the Volt-order demon Inspects, it'll turn up hard-to-find places or things.  Or, just press the L1 button to Inspect.  Try using Inspect to investigate suspcious places.   found scrape marks by the side of the wainscot!  There are scrape marks on the wainscot...  to figure out the trick to this thing. Your  demons can Inspect things. Let's use a Volt-order demon's power. Your demon's found a likely spot, . Let's check it out.  The demon has found some suspicious books. You notice there's no dust in this place? Pretty suspicious for a storeroom. Five will get you ten that shelf is the trick to the wainscot, .  Take a book? Take The Lost and the Motherless Raidou left the books on the shelf.  Raidou took A Feng Shui Handbook.  It was an interesting read, but nothing happened.  Raidou took The Lost and the Motherless.  It was an interesting read, but nothing happened.  Raidou took Demons of this Earth.  As Raidou pulled on the book, the wainscot began to slide away.  Raidou took The Father of Shugendo.  It was an interesting read, but nothing happened.  The path leading underground has opened.  There's nothing suspicious to investigate.   inspected the area.  Use the demon's Inspect skill?  Take a book? Looks like a bust. Try another one, maybe? So, Miss Kaya's little ditty was actually directions to the basement area... If that's the case, then what did In the depths of the abyss, the demon's blood must be slain mean? Anyhow, let's check out the underground, .  A huge demon is loitering here. Huh? What's a demon like that doing beneath the Daidouji place? It doesn't look like it's about to attack... But, we can't just leave it be. For one thing, it's blocking our path. Maybe you can reason with it, .   tried to negotiate. Ehhhhh... Don't mind me, sonny. No dice. This geezer doesn't want to talk to us. No skin off our nose. He doesn't want to spill, we got ways of finding what we want to know.  The demon calmed down.  Raidou tried negotiating again. Garr....  Raidou couldn't understand the demon's speech. , you dope. How are you supposed to understand demon talk? If you want to negotiate with a beast like this, you gotta have your demon speak its language.   tried to negotiate with the demon. ...... Don't mind me, sonny.  The demon stopped speaking to Raidou. This geezer doesn't want to talk to us. No skin off our nose. He doesn't want to spill, we got ways of finding what we want to know. What am I doing here... Sitting around, letting some whippersnapper keep me locked up in a basement... I wonder if my last master's store is doing all right... Haaaahhh... I'll never forget the wonderful tastes of that place. That one in particular, mmmm... Dagnabbit, I have a powerful hankering for that taste. It sure wants whatever its master used to serve it again. , maybe if we fired it up a little, it might come clean about its master. Gaaar! Grrraaaaar! Hrnh, hrnh, hrnh! Now you've made me hopping mad! Your life won't be worth a plugged nickel when I'm done with you, sonny! Brace yourself, Raidou... I think we made him angry. Garrr... garr... Graahhhhh... Go ahead and finish this geezer off, sonny... Eh? You're letting me live? Well, as creaky as my old bones are... ...that's awful decent of you. You're a nice boy, sonny. Was there something you wanted to ask me? YesOh, I'm in your way, am I? Eh? You want me to give you fellers a ride on my back to the other side? Quit fooling around! Although... It's true that you are some good boys. You let me live, anyway. I reckon I could take you across, if you need me to. I'm just missing one thing. That lip-smacking taste! I need some more of that before I die! I'll never forget that red wine my last master used to make... What!? Don't fool around, sonny! Ohh, the kids today... Anyway, was there something you wanted? Say, I've got a fine idea. Why don't you whippersnappers bring back some of that good red wine? You can't get that red wine anyway. It's gotta be ordered special. You'll have to go to my old master's store to get some. What's that, boy? Speak up! You want to know where the store is? Now, what was it called again? My memory ain't what it once was... Ah! Tawara-Ya, that's the ticket! Right, right, it was definitely called Tawara-Ya. I'm counting on you, sonny. Be a good boy and bring me my drink. The store's called Tawara-Ya. I'm counting on you to bring me my drink, sonny.   has cooled the demon's passions.   set the demon's passions ablaze.   read the demon's mind. Vodka*dook dook dook*  The Large Tarrasque took a swig of the drink.  Raidou didn't have any to give him. *dook dook*...Gaaarrhh!  The Large Tarrasque downed the whole thing in one shot. It better take us to the other side after all that trouble... Guuuurrr! Graaarrr!!  The drink contained only water... Large Tarrasque has lost all of its energy.  Go to the other side?  Raidou crossed over to the other side.  Raidou left.  Go back to the other side?  Raidou returned to the other shore.  Raidou left. Yeah, that's the one, by cracky! That color... that aroma... Ohhhh... Hurry! Give an old man his drink! ...Aaaahhh... Now that really hit the spot. That exquisite taste...  Large Tarrasque is in its own world... Now then, you wanted to get to the other side?  The negotiation with Large Tarrasque was a success. Garr.... Gaaa! I'm Large Tarrasque, the boss of the Daidouji Residence's underground. What do you want, sonny? You here for a reason, or just poking your nose into other people's business? What!? I'm in the way, am I!? You whippersnappers have the gall to ask for a ride across on my back!? ...... Huh. Well, in that case... I want to get liquored up first. Not just any ordinary stuff, mind. I want some . Nothing like a good bottle of the red stuff. I'm counting on you, sonny. Now go get me my drink. , y'hear? I'm counting on you to get me my drink, sonny. Yeah, that's the stuff! That color... that aroma... Ohhhh... Hurry! Give an old man his drink! Come on... Just a little closer...  Approach the Large Tarrasque? That's the ticket! Thanks for the drink, sonny! But... I'm not going to drink this on an empty stomach! Down the hatch, kiddo! Quick, give me my drink! I give! I give, sonny! Just lay off! I'll do whatever you ask! Please! Come on, I got no beef with you. Garrr... garr... Graahhhhh... Eh? Hey, kid. Is that another kind of liquor I smell on you? Come a little closer.  Raidou moved beside the demon. I thought as much! I smell the alcohol on you, kiddo, and don't try to hide it! Just give me a little of the ol' drinky and I won't tell your parents.  Raidou handed over the Red Wine.  Raidou kept the Pricey Beer to himself. You... What a rotten kid! See if I take you to the other side now!  Raidou handed over the Pricey Beer. Let's have a little taste... ...... Urgh! G... Gahh...  It didn't go down well with the demon. Urk! S-So bitter... what's this malty taste? This tastes like goat piss! Is this what the kids today are drinking!? These old bones are getting cold. I want liquor that'll warm me up. Eh? Hey, kid. Is that another kind of liquor I smell on you? Come a little closer.  Raidou kept the Vodka to himself.  Raidou handed over the Vodka. Let's have a little taste... ...... Whoa! Yowza! I felt that, kiddo! Whew! This is fantastic! I feel like my throat's on fire! Ahhh... That's great. Good job, kiddo. I'll pay you back with some of my treasure!  What will you give Large Tarrasque? Red WineRed WineRed WineWhew, no more. I'm about over my limit. Thanks, sonny. If only all the youth today was as kind as you...  Where will you go? The depths of the cave The Large Tarrasque can take you elsewhere.  Give the Vodka to Large Tarrasque?  Give the Pricey Beer to Large Tarrasque? Pricey Beer Raidou kept the alcohol to himself.  The chamber is elevated.   used the power of Flight.  Go down? This is no ordinary storeroom. Look carefully. See the way the room is covered with dust, ? Well, this spot here is completely clean. It looks pretty fishy. I'd say it's a cover-up job. See if you can use a demon to  this place and uncover whatever someone's trying to hide. A diary, huh...? Notice how the book fits exactly into the space where there wasn't any dust. This is clearly some important stuff. No time for privacy, let's open 'er up and take a read. March 28th Weather: sunny My uncle has seemed a little off lately. He sounded pretty steamed on the phone just now. I hope he's not letting those jackals get to him about the debt from the factory. April 4th Weather: rain Dad collapsed this morning. My uncle said we'd have to have a private talk soon. About the inheritance, I guess. I hate that he's saying these things while Dad is still alive. April 5th Weather: cloudy My uncle didn't want to talk about the property. Instead, he told me about the Daidouji curse. I'll be 16 in only a month or two... I don't know what to do. Someone, please help me... I woke up in this prison cell. How did I end up here? My uncle came in my room, and... I don't remember anything that happened after that. This must have been Kaya's. An uncle suffering from debt at his factory, a father in critical condition... And, didn't Rin say that the Daidouji daughters were cursed to be possessed by a demon? Whoever hid this diary wasn't just trying to hide it from humans. He was thinking about demons, too. We've gotta brace the uncle in the living room, whatever it takes.  Raidou obtained .  There was nothing that stood out.   inspected the area. Originally the Volt-order demon uses the skill Inspect here. However, since the game is underdeveloped, assume the Inspect is done beforehand. But make sure to have a Volt-order demon before you proceed. Inspect is a skill which glows a place where's suspicious. Originally the shelf will glow. This time, check the shelf first, after Gouto gave a hint, and having a Volt-order demon behind you.  A book is stuck between the bookshelf and the bureau.  Pick it up?  Raidou left it there.  It's a dusty bookshelf and a bureau.   ignored the object caught between the bookshelf and the bureau.  Torn up papers are scattered inside the jail. We can't get any clue with this... . Use your demon to do Inspect. There still might be some clues around. Continue the investigation. Seems like you collected the pieces of paper. If we connect these with the pages that were torn, we can read the diary.  It's a piece of paper that may have come from the diary. Garrr... garr... Graahhhhh... Oh, it's you, sonny.  Your sideburns seem a mite sharper today. Gaaar! Gah geh graaar!  Raidou couldn't understand the demon's speech.   couldn't understand the demon's speech.   carefully observed Large Tarrasque's facial expressions.  It seems to want to talk to a demon which can read minds.  Raidou spoke to it.  Raidou explained the situation. What's that? You want me to cross an ocean this time? ...... Well, I suppose I do owe you a thing or two. I can help you out, sure... But, don't forget that I'm a demon too, sonny. We need a contract if you want me to do anything more for you. How about it, sonny? You open to negotiating?  Negotiate with Large Tarrasque? YesLet's see now... Why don't we start off with the matter of my fee? Right! Let's get down to brass tacks. Good, good. Let's get down to brass tacks. YesYesI see. I'm a touch disappointed...  Large Tarrasque looks dejected.  Large Tarrasque somehow looks even older. Much obliged, sonny. So... Give me 100 yen. Give me 300 yen. Give me 500 yen. Give me 1,000 yen. I appreciate it, sonny.  Large Tarrasque grins wickedly, wondering if it can take all your money. Sorry, kiddo, that won't be enough.  Raidou gave Large Tarrasque 100 yen.  Raidou gave Large Tarrasque 300 yen.  Raidou gave Large Tarrasque 500 yen.  Raidou gave Large Tarrasque 1,000 yen. For shame, sonny, making promises you can't pay up on. I think we're done for today. Let that be a lesson, kiddo: there are some things in life that require cold, hard cash. Much obliged, sonny. ...... Although... this isn't enough, now that I think about it. YesWhat!? Why, you...! Don't mess with me, boy!  Large Tarrasque started to behave violently. Calm it down Raidou somehow managed to calm it down. Ah, well. Whatever you say, kiddo.  Raidou scolded Large Tarrasque. ......  Large Tarrasque suddenly calmed down. Sorry, kiddo. I forgot you're such a nice boy. I think that's enough negotiating for a nice, binding contract. Take this as a token of our agreement.  Raidou obtained the Flute of Rhone. Toot that flute anywhere in the Capital where you see a pier. I'll come along to help as fast as my aching bones will take me. Nicely done. Now we can enter  to the north of Harumi-Cho.  Continue to negotiate with Large Tarrasque? (Enter the battle with Grand Tarrasque) (After the battle, the negotiation fails)  A large demon is directly in front of you.  However, it isn't moving to attack you... That big lug is called a Tarrasque. We'll have to do something about it to move on. It looks pretty tough... Maybe we should try talking first. Yes Raidou spoke to the Tarrasque. Gar gar... Garrrr.  Raidou left. I have no clue what it's saying. If we had a demon that understands that beast's language...  (In fact, you talk to Tarrasque with Cerberus)  Cerberus began the negotiation with Tarrasque!  > ....... Tarrasque want drinky. If bring drinky, take you to other side. Tarrasque say so. Alcohol... Let's look for it starting from somewhere close...  should have some great quality alcohol!   began the negotiation with Tarrasque!  ...... No good. I can't understand the beast's language. someone who understands the beast's language. Gerrrr...?  Which one will you give him? Japanese SakeGurrrr...!  Tarrasque is sipping on it.  Raidou didn't have any. Garrrr!!  Tarrasque drank the whole thing in one shot. Seems like it can take us to the other side. Guuuurrr, Gaaaaar!!  Seems like water was in there... Tarrasque has lost its energy...  Ask Tarrasque to go to the other side? Yes Went over to the other side!  Decided not to ask.  Ask Tarrasque to go back to the other side? Yes Came back to the other side!  Decided not to ask. You a summoner? Want using my power? Show first your strength! Test your strength against Cerberus. If you defeat him, he'll join you as a demon. You strong! Me join you! Nice meet you... !  There's nothing here anymore.  The door is locked.  Use  to open it? Yes The demon was able to open the door.  Raidou decided not to open it.  It's a reading room.  There's nothing here.  The door is locked.  The door is locked. , use your demon's power to unlock the door.   squeezed through the keyhole...  It's a storeroom.  There's nothing useful inside.  It's a storeroom.   didn't see anything interesting.  It's a break room for the servants.  There's something inside.

It's no surprise that the Dark Realm is connected here. Stay on your toes! ! Can you hear those voices in the living room? , that conversation in there... Why don't you use a demon to eavesdrop?  Send the demon out solo.  will be able to move alone.  By having  examine the door to the living room, you can eavesdrop on the conversation. Sir, I believe I mentioned earlier that the living room is off limits to guests at this time. Please, if you need anything, one of the servants not in the living room will help you. .

Are you really a Devil Summoner? A long time ago, I was with a Summoner. I forget his name, though. He acted like I wasn't there, and never thought to heal me when I was hurt. I never had much fun being a demon after that... But, if I had a Summoner who'd never leave me helpless, I'd be his demon for sure!  In battle, you can bring the demon close to you.  Hold the L1 button to call the demon near Raidou, and it will stick close to him.  It's best used when dodging enemy attacks. You're riding around on Large Tarrasque's back?

I'll save my allowance and negotiate with Large Tarrasque myself! Y-You don't... *sniff* You don't have to lie... Golly! You're a demon after all. You scared me. I thought you were human at first.  Business dealings between Kiyoshi and an unknown man can be heard...  The conversation between Kiyoshi and the other man is still in progress... ...Pardon me, Sir. No one is permitted to enter without an appointment. I am sorry, but I must ask that you leave.  Mention the missing girl....You spoke with her? Is that true!? Sir, it isn't that I don't believe you... However, that could have been any number of young women. Do you have any sort of proof that the young lady you met was Miss Daidouji?  Raidou showed him the Butterfly Brooch. . I work here at the Daidouji Residence as a butler. Might I ask your name? Also, what business brings you here? ...... So, you've met young Miss Daidouji, have you? Yes... That's hers...! I must apologize for my rudeness. Please Sir, follow me. I understand that you met Kaya. I'm , her uncle. Can you... tell me what happened?  Raidou explained the previous night's events to Kiyoshi. Kaya... My god... Well, she... disappeared about ten days ago. Since then, my brother's illness has continued to get worse. We're an old, prestigious family, as I'm sure you already know. Kaya would have taken his place... if it... came to that. But, if something happens to her, what will become of the Daidouji family name? That's really my biggest concern. However, if you really met Kaya last night, then... You said your name was Raidou? I'd like you to track Kaya down. My brother isn't doing well. I was recently informed there is nothing his doctors can do. ...I want him to see his daughter's face one last time. Let me know as soon as you find out where she is. ...I'm really worried about her. We can only pray she's still all right. It's time, Sir... If you have any questions,  will be glad to answer them. Now, if you'll excuse me... I'm expecting company. Master Daidouji has already asked the police to search for Miss Kaya. I'm not trying to supercede Master Kiyoshi's words, but there's no need to trouble you. Besides, the Master would prefer this matter not be made public. Do understand. Now, if you'll excuse me, I should return to my duties. I'd say that butler doesn't like us very much. But, Kiyoshi did ask us to investigate, so what say we ? Ah, good day to you, Sir. Back again, I see... What might we help you with this time? I'm sorry, but we simply do not have anyone who can show you around. My apologies, Sir. ...I guess the servants are all tied up at the moment. That's good news for us; now we can . This is all wrong... How could I let it turn out like this? ...I just wanted to stop my brother from killing Kaya! I really believed she could be saved, and that I could as well... How could I be so stupid? My factory... My employees... I can't let them down, either!  Kiyoshi began to groan and writhe in agony.  Kiyoshi transformed into a demon and disappeared into the Dark Realm. ! I do beg your pardon, Sir. Master Daidouji instructed me not to let anyone enter his study without his permission. ...I'm going to have to ask you to stay away from that room. That's the door to her father's study, huh? Interesting. So you can't go inside, because the butler will give you an earful if he sees you... ...meaning you can't go. But someone could, as long as the butler didn't see 'em. . They're invisible to the human eye.  Open the menu by pressing the R1  button and select Solo.  This command will allow you to control a demon remotely.  Move the demon into the forbidden study. Pardon me, Sir. Master Kiyoshi has instructed me not to let anyone into the living room until his meeting is over. ...Please, stay away from that room. We don't have any reason to bother Kiyoshi, at least for now... Stick to sleuthing one thing at a time, big guy. We need to figure out if that song Rin told us about can lead us to Kaya... ...It's no bull session in there, that's for sure. You know what needs to be done. But, do it quickly. We don't want to get left holding the bag. I did think it strange you were avoiding the living room... How could you let this happen? It should be here any minute! I sent the new hire to Tsukudo-Cho for it! Aren't you the person I asked to handle this...? It's not my fault, though! I bet that new hire is just wasting time somewhere... ...Pipe down! This is insulting to our guest. This is all due to your utter lack of leadership ability. ...We will continue this talk later. DiDN'T yOU LeaRN iN ScHoOL tO nOt ToUcH OTheR PeoPLe's StUFf!? WE waTCHed yOU TaKe pEEk iNsiDE oF ThAT! YoU DiD! You're the Devil Summoner who's been sniffin' around this place lately, aren'tcha? I was told some weird kid's been investigating the residence, so be careful. I was hopin' to trash this before you managed to find it, but... ...looks like y'found it. Not sure if that's luck or un-luck, necessarily. I feel kind of bad, y'know? I mean, you're just a kid. ...But, y'did read the diary, so I gotta kill you! ...I thought that... ...hand Kaya over... ...the deal!? Hey, did you hear that? I guarantee whatever they're talking about in there is important. Maybe if we stood closer to the door... That butler is such a wet blanket. ...Normal detectives would probably have to leave and search for other evidence. Luckily, we have a Devil Summoner on our side. ...Right, ?   listened in to the conversation in the living room. Th-This is all a misunderstanding! I just wanted her to see him one last time. I was going to return her to you! So you hired a detective to take her to his death bed? I don't believe what I'm hearing. Takeshi's condition reflects only your own feelings toward him. ...And your hatred of your talented older brother is quite obvious. Wha--!? That isn't true! I was doing it for Kaya's sake! Don't worry, you'll still be paid the amount we agreed on, as long as everything goes according to plan. It will be more than enough to pay off that factory debt. Just make sure no one else intervenes! ...Otherwise, I will see to it that you end up just like your brother. And, I suppose that girl as well. ...Intriguing. But, even with the diary, that's circumstantial evidence at best. Wonder what Narumi would do. . It's no guarantee, but... hey, you're not offering up any ideas.  Torn-out papers are strewn  around the bookshelf.  Mokoi collected the papers and collated them to restore the diary. March 30th Weather: overcast My uncle's been a sourpuss lately. He's on the phone now, and I can hear him shouting from here. He's usually swell, but I guess worries about the future have been eating him. April 20th Weather: light rain Dad's delirious... He just says kill her, over and over. If I hear him say it one more time, I'll scream. I haven't even done anything, it's just my bloodline. What will happen to me if I become a demon? May 11th Eleventh, rain My sixteenth birthday is coming up. There'll be nothing sweet about it. If I had just been born a boy, none of this would have happened. I don't know what day it is anymore. The terrible stench of the mold woke me up. I'm covered in scars, and that iron grille... This is it, then. I'm becoming a demon...  The rest of the entry has been blotted out. My uncle came to visit me down here.  I don't know how long it's been since I've seen him. Don't worry, my dear, he said, but he looked so anguished that it wasn't much comfort.  It appears that the diary was Kaya's.  Raidou obtained . This is the end of the line, Raidou.  You didn't find anything useful. ...I make it a policy not to reveal family secrets. Slip him 100 yen...... I take pride in my work, sir. A bribe will not sway me. V-Very well, ask me anything. Ask about Takeshi DaidoujiHe's the master of this house. However, he's been sleeping heavily due to an illness. We do our humble best, but the doctor said there's little to no chance of recovery. I-Is there anything else you wanted to know? Master Kiyoshi is Master Daidouji's brother. You met him in the living room, I believe. I appreciate his concerns, but he's not suitable to lead the Daidouji family. Master Daidouji gave him a loan to start his own business, but it was a catastrophic failure. I-Is there anything else you wanted to know? He's been loyal to the family since Master Daidouji and Master Kiyoshi were children. He's very devoted, and Master Daidouji has unshakable trust in him. He's the quintessential butler. I do wish he was a little less... demanding. Working under him can be exhausting. I-Is there anything else you wanted to know? F-Feel free to ask me anything else. Wh-Why are you giving me that look!? I won't be bullied, no matter how long you stare at me... C-Come now, sir, let's not come to blows. H-Hello Raidou... can I help you? C'mon! Scram, before Mr. Nakamura sees me taking a break. Slip her 100 yen......  The servant snapped up the 100-yen bill and stuffed it into her pocket. ...Ask your questions, but make it quick. I'm on the clock here. Ask about Kaya DaidoujiShe doesn't look down her nose at us like the other fat cats. She makes time for us servants. But she never saw eye to eye with her father. She doesn't even come to visit him anymore. Frankly, I can see why, but I wonder if she isn't being a little too cold to the old man. ...Ask if you're asking. Time's a-wasting. That... incident... happened about 10 days ago. Miz Kaya came home from school and went right up to her room as  usual. We all saw her. That was the last anyone saw of her, though. Her room was still clean, and her clothes were all there, so she must still be in her uniform... ...Ask if you're asking. Time's a-wasting. Everyone's heard the rumors of the cursed family. Some say one of the family eats the flesh of women, and some say they breed terrible creatures. ...Ask if you're asking. Time's a-wasting. Hey... keep this on the down low, all right? I don't want Mr. Nakamura finding out. No, really, get outta here. They could dock my pay for this. ...If you've got something to say, spit it out already.  You don't have enough money... What are you trying to pull? Get outta here, will you? You'll get me in hot water. We were havin' a hard enough time tracking down Kaya, and now another Daidouji's gone missing. Lucky thing I'm on the job! They assigned me here for an emergency search of the premises. So much for my day off, though...  Detective Kazama's spirit was rekindled. Sheesh, if it's not one thing at this mansion, it's another. Don't get me wrong, pal. More work for the police department is swell by me! ...... ...Wha--!? Oh! It's you, Raidou! Hey, you really look different. You look like a man now. ...I used to be the leader of the local gang of punks. But, now I'm sporting this cherry blossom crest, workin' on the side of the law. Even though I'm using cuffs instead of my fists, I still hate crooked people. I decided to become a flatfoot cause I can be myself... with what little brains I got. You've got the same eyes I did when I was young: reckless, yet straightforward. ...Take this, will ya? When you get to be my age, make sure to keep that sparkle in your eyes.  Raidou obtained the . Detective Kazama is in a foul mood today. See how his smile doesn't reach his eyes? He loves to razz us rookies, and he's going to start any minute now... Detective Kazama is in a foul mood today. See how his smile doesn't reach his eyes? He loves to razz us rookies, though at least he's not as bad as the Kantou Haguro-gumi. Detective Kazama was transferred to another case. Probably another emergency needs his attention. Finally, I can take a load off! Detective Kazama should be in Ginza-Cho. My buddy over there is probably in for a rough time. I can't say it to his face, but I wish Detective Kazama would recognize that times have changed. None of these young turks will take him seriously if he preaches at them all the time. I absolutely didn't see anything... It's just my mind playing tricks on me.  The skittish policeman's thoughts can be heard... I-I didn't see anything... There wasn't any flying merman... And, I especially didn't see a huge turtle. That's crazy talk! Mr. Nakamura is the perfect butler. He takes his work to an almost nauseating level. He should show more concern for the staff under him. Mr. Nakamura never alters his ramrod-straight posture or his poker-faced expression. But, by his tone of voice and choice of words when he talked to her... I can tell that he's quite upset. Wh-What happened to Mr. Nakamura in the living room...? He's visibly upset, and that's a little scary! What on earth happened in there...? Mr. Nakamura is absent due to poor health caused by the stress he's been under. ...Not the best time to entertain guests here. ...Not an awfully good time to entertain guests here. By which, I mean you. Miz Kaya's schoolmate has been coming around, but she can't take the hint... When you're no longer served drinks, it's a sign that you've overstayed your welcome. Mr. Nakamura has returned, but he's eerily calm these days. He doesn't terrorize us as much now. Strange to say, but it seems more boring around here... Miz Kaya would sometimes be out until late into the night. She always dressed properly, so so I doubt she was out carousing, but... This wouldn't have happened if Master Kiyoshi was a little stricter. He's too soft on that girl. Mr. Nakamura's expression has been indescribable. He looks both sad and relieved at the same time. I've never seen anything like it. I've noticed that Mr. Nakamura keeps giving Miss Rin funny looks. He still looks sad, but I think he's really sorry for her too. Miz Kaya never gave Master Daidouji trouble because she was straight with him. But if you look at it another way, maybe he just gave up on her. Still, I've never seen her so happy. Mr. Nakamura's calmed down a lot. All he ever cared about was this place's owner. He never gave a fig for us. Mr. Nakamura has really calmed down lately. I guess he doesn't have it in him to worry about anyone other than the Daidoujis. From what you said to Mr. Nakamura, you've seen Miz Kaya, right? What is she doing out there? Why is she dodging the police investigation? I've seen Mr. Nakamura act interested in what's under your cape. I don't suspect you of anything personally, but I have to admit, I'm kind of curious myself. It looks like everyone's calmed down after the monster attack. I'll have to work pretty hard now. What with Master Daidouji, Miz Kaya, and all the other problems here... well, it'll never be boring. Go down the hallway and into the storeroom for a spot to pass the time reading books. I realize the books are thick and somewhat difficult; I apologize for our lack of comics or magazines. Gracious, I had no idea the storeroom was connected to the cellar. I wasn't even aware we had a cellar. There appears to be a disturbance in the foyer. I'd best stay put until things settle down. Mr. Nakamura is taking a sick day due to overwork. If you require assistance, let me know. It's my duty as the butler's substitute to provide aid. It may be time for Mr. Nakama to retire and pass the torch to a new generation. You wish to enter the trader's private property? I-I believe the Daidouji family has a connection which could be exploited, yes. But, I certainly couldn't... Well, why don't you ask Mr. Nakamura when he returns? Mr. Nakamura has returned. It's quite stressful for him. He suffers all the trouble of this manor in our stead. I've heard that the family is considering an adoption to replace Miss Kaya. I wonder, because of the turmoil... Is the consensus here that Miss Kaya is lost to us forever? Everyone here appears to be in the doldrums, but shouldn't now be a time of rejoicing? ...Something is missing, though, I will grant you. It's Miss Kaya's 16th birthday! ...Oh, dear, I suppose that's not much fun if Miss Kaya isn't here. We've been discussing the adoption, to prepare for the worst. Does Miss Rin seem like a suitable candidate? She is the same age as Miss Kaya, after all. I heard from the rest of the staff that Miss Kaya is still in Tsukudo-Cho. Running away from home... I understand completely. I did the same thing when I was a boy. I believe the young Miss Rin has been a good influence on Mr. Nakamura. Her concern for Miss Kaya may have caused him to fall into a May- December romance! Detectives are meant to search for people, not to simply leave a note and wander off. Perhaps investigating a disappearance inspired him to  disappear as well? What was that racket? Ah, the people in the upstairs rooms. I suppose one of them tripped and fell. What's causing all that shaking? Ah, the people upstairs again. They really should be careful of their footing. Odd, but I feel my sixth sense for detecting the paranormal has grown stronger during my service here. What about the others? Are they seeing anything untoward? Everyone must have a home to return to. Isn't this mansion where Miss Kaya should return? G-Good heavens... I've just remembered my mother, alone in her own home... If I knew this place was haunted, I wouldn't have even applied for this job! The help-wanted ad being tailor- made for me should have tipped me off that it'd be a nightmare. If I knew this place was haunted, I wouldn't have even applied for this job... Y-You are a... guy, right? A guy? I-I was too late... to notice... Th-This is a haunted... mansion... Haunted mansion... Why did I ever come back here... The plan was to quit this haunted mansion and never return... I'm so sleepy... so... sleepy. Just standing up makes me tired. But when I start to nod off, that voice from underground... Can't you hear that voice from underground? Either someone is there, or... P-People are buried when they die, aren't they? C-Can the corpses talk...!? Maybe the heebie-jeebies this place gives me are just my imagination. But, that voice I heard from underground at midnight... D-Did the man in that portrait just move!?  Wh-What am I saying...? Hey, don't you think the mansion is getting... noisy? Th-That's right... Today was the day... N-No wonder the voices are getting louder... By now I'm used to the voices, but something about them is different today... Sometimes they're almost deafening, and sometimes they're so quiet I can barely hear them... I saw Miss Kaya in Tsukudo-Cho... I think. Maybe it wasn't her. She had a different hairstyle, and she was too far away to be sure. Y-You can't hear it? That chorus of voices, calling out from underground? I used to hear the underground voice as just a groaning sound... But, now I can hear the words it's saying. I won't tell you any more... It could drive us both mad. A-Aaagh! It feels like there's a terrible pressure on my head. It's not just a normal headache, it's like... someone's gaze, drilling into my soul... H-Hey! The cat that follows you around, is it all right? Oh... I just wondered if the cat was okay, that's all. I don't think the voice underground will ever go away... it sounds so lonely. After hearing that voice for so long, I've decided that I also want to be buried underground when I go.  The horrified servant's spirit was rekindled. I hear it underground! A woman crying, night after night! I'm not making this up! See these rings under my eyes? If she keeps crying, I'll go insane! H-Hey! That voice, did it get louder? I'm telling you, it's not my imagination! Did I just hear laughter...? I can see the light... I hear a woman sobbing! And, it's coming from... you! What's going on!? That man in the living room is Master Kiyoshi, right? Isn't it? Please, tell me it's him! I hear it... the underground voice! Just when I thought my sleepless nights were over! I'm scared that if I fall asleep, the underground voice will take me. I won't let it happen! You hear me? You won't get me! I-I don't want to think about  what might be underground. I can hear them... I hear the voices down there! If I only I could pretend this mansion isn't really haunted... But, I know what I heard! The underground voice, every midnight! I think I saw that portrait's eyes move! I-I know it's not possible... But, once the idea of the eyes moving is in your head, you can't help but see it happen! That underground voice is so loud! I've never heard it scream this loud before! Tomorrow is... that's right, that rumor was...! N-No! Today is... fourteen, fifteen... sixteen! If that rumor is true, then... today is the day! It's happening! I-I can hear it! A young girl's voice, and a horrible roaring sound! W-Wait, what happened...? The v-voice... the voices stopped. A-A Daidouji family servant wouldn't mistake the face of their only daughter! I did see Miss Kaya! S-She had legs, and she wasn't glowing, so... The voices underground were out of synch, but then they all started to speak in unison... What's happening!? Please, don't interfere and wake the dead! I hear the underground voice...! Space... space... space... Space...? What space? What is it talking about? A-Aaagh! It feels like there's a terrible pressure on my head. It's no ordinary headache... The space that the underground voice was talking about was... Th-The sky? I can hear a cat yowling together with the other underground voices... I think! I can hear its suffering... hear its pain! How can you be so calm in your condition!? The cat that was with you... That cat, it's...! The underground voices just wanted us to notice them. Only I can hear them, but I'll always pay attention to the precious voices. You came from Tsukudo-Cho? Have you seen our cowork-- ...Oh, forget it. It's not important anyway. Mr. Raidou, weren't you going back and forth between the mansion and Tsukudo-Cho? Have you seen our cowor... Well, on second thought, never mind. It's not my fault... I have to remember, it's not my fault... Oh! Mr. Raidou. I-I didn't say anything... What? Wine!? I already sent someone to Tsukudo-Cho... N-No, please forget about it. Eh? The Tawara-Ya owner's turtle? The wine is for... the turtle!? I-I don't know about any turtles! Stop asking me about turtles! In the end, the wine didn't make it here in time. I'll get a talking-to from Mr. Nakamura. I'm not worried. I'll just nod my head at appropriate intervals and pretend I'm listening. What is Mr. Nakamura doing? That's... a rather vulgar dance. He was the one who told us to maintain our poise in front of the guests.  The irritated servant's thoughts can be heard... I wonder how far she went... Tsukudo-Cho isn't far at all. She shouldn't be out this long...! I should've done it myself! If only I wasn't too lazy to walk there. We really screwed the pooch this time! The guest's favorite wine isn't here! It's all the fault of that new girl! I had nothing to do with it! I asked the new girl to go pick up some things in Tsukudo-Cho, but she's not back yet! Sheesh, I can already hear Mr. Nakamura's interminable droning... It's painful just to think about... Turtle? I hope he's not talking about that turtle I found in front of the building. I threw it away... It was so shabby and dirty... It's not my fault! I didn't kill it! You heard the butler. Don't poke your nose where it doesn't belong, boy. If you don't behave yourself, I might have to lay down the law. Do we understand each other? I can't believe our superior is being so lenient with this guy. If it was me, I'd use these fists to give him a thrashing he wouldn't soon forget. So it's true that the Daidoujis hired a detective. Isn't that kinda expensive? Well, if Master Kiyoshi says so, I guess it'll be fine. Miss Rin...? Oh, her! That girl who brings us food from the dessert parlor! She used to come over pretty often, but not so much lately. Miss Rin was almost kidnapped? Miss Kaya did mention to me that she thinks she was being followed... Was that Master Kiyoshi I heard just now? It sounded like he was on the second floor. He sounded a lot more agitated than I'm used to, though. He's not usually that loud. Mr. Nakamura has been acting strange since he met with Master Kiyoshi in the living room. I think Mr. Nakamura is under a lot of pressure from all sides, and it's driving him batty... Oh, er... Mr. Nakamura told me that the other servants are currently undergoing training elsewhere... N-Never mind. Really, it's nothing. Y-You see that guy on the landing? The gangster wearing a jack... urk! N-Never mind. Really, it's nothing. You see that guy over there? That polic... N-Never mind. Really, it's nothing. You see that guy over there? That polic... N-Never mind. Really, it's nothing. The policeman who was just here until a moment ago... N-Never mind. Really, it's nothing. Master Kiyoshi is a wanted man now, isn't he? Where could you find a guy like that... Well, there is one place that I know he goes... Some people talk out of both sides of their mouth about  Master Kiyoshi... Not me, you understand... I mean the other servants. As soon as everyone came back here, Mr. Nakamura fell ill. I wonder... Miss Rin is here, isn't she? I guess she didn't bring any sweets today, though. How rude. I-I mean, to the guests. Miss Rin usually brings a bag from the dessert parlor and hands out... Er... Well, I suppose it's backward to expect the guests to cater to the servants. After the unfortunate incident with Master Kiyoshi, Miss Rin comes around more often. She always brings food... Er, I mean, she's a great girl who cares a lot about her friends. Miss Kaya is a bit of a shrinking violet. She doesn't have many friends. She's with the soldiers right now, but... hmm... I heard Miss Rin ordered a cake from the dessert parlor... Oh...! Now I get it. Miss Rin's cake was a little bit bigger this time... That's... so sad. Maybe I should tell Miss Rin about the rumor that's going around... On the other hand, if people are wrong, I don't want to get her hopes up for nothing. Maybe I should tell Miss Rin about the rumor that's going around... But, there's still no verified sightings. It could just be  someone's idea of a prank. I feel awful for Miss Rin, but... I don't think Miss Kaya is coming back. I mustn't say that in front of her, though. Miss Rin is so hopeful that she'll see Miss Kaya again. The solders are acting up... how odd. Oh dear, I can feel the itch again to turn into a gawker. What was that loud noise just now? I was so startled, I fell over. I'm fine, but I could feel the gawker in me coming right out. That sure was some earthquake, huh? It swept me right off my feet. Whew, I'm still rattled... but, I'm getting the urge to go rubbernecking again. Ahh, pardon me... Do you prefer dogs or cats? A dog is a man's best friend.Oh, really now? I didn't think you'd go to the dogs. If that's what you think, won't the cat with you be cross? Naturally! I'm also a cat lady, you know. I love the way you never know if they'll pay attention to you. I absolutely adore that black cat with you sooo much. It's like it's actually looking down on me! I've been working in the Daidouji mansion for a long time now. I think I'll be sitting around... I mean, working hard here for a long time to come!  The gossipy servant's thoughts can be heard... Kiyoshi's not the sharpest knife in the drawer. He can barely even pay us. This whole thing will probably give him even more white hair. Is this about the thing with Miss Kaya? How sad. How am I supposed to eat the dessert parlor's shortcake when I'm feeling like this...? Is it someone wanting ransom money from the parents...? Or is it just a pervert with a fetish for schoolgirl outfits? Usually, introspective people keep all their stress bottled up inside... Well, compared to Master Daidouji, he's not the sharpest knife in the drawer. Mr. Nakamura was acting equally hostile towards Master Daidouji and Kiyoshi... Is he stewing because Kiyoshi isn't as good as Master Daidouji? Actually, he told me that Kiyoshi was acting strange... Everyone else took the day off, but not me. I wouldn't miss excitement like this for the world! I can't believe a man who looks like that is a real detective. He's not really with Kantou Haguro-gumi? If his kids had to look at a face like that every day, they'd burst into tears. Excuse you, Mr. Policeman! I'm cleaning here! Get out of my way! indeed. Can't he see we're mere servants here? He only told me not to move, right? I'll just watch from over here, then. After all, he never told me not to watch. I don't care if you have to search the house, just put the furniture back in its place! Everyone else is taking the day off, so I have to clean up after these brutes! Kiyoshi didn't smoke or drink; he was always totally focused on his work. If he was going anywhere besides here, it would probably be... his factory in Senju-Ku. The servants call Kiyoshi the dullest Daidouji behind his back. They think he isn't very bright, but he's just so focused on his work that he can be rather tactless. Kiyoshi is in hot water, Master Daidouji is seriously ill, and Miss Kaya's missing... It's taking its toll on Mr. Nakamura. I think he's getting the sleep madness. I've been working so hard today... isn't it snack time yet? I live for the dessert parlor's shortcake. No... they couldn't have... Tell me they didn't forget the shortcake! I'm craving shortcake something fierce. I've gotta have it! The dessert parlor's shortcake is the berries. That delicately puffy sponge cake... The exquisitely fresh cream! Even if the soldiers aren't Miss Kaya's type, if one of them is carrying a torch for her... Middle-aged servicemen might be attracted to a pure type like Kaya. That's right, I'd forgotten. Tomorrow is Miss Kaya's... That poor little girl. I think she actually believes Miss Kaya is coming back. Today is Miss Kaya's birthday. Miss Rin must have brought a bigger cake because she thought Miss Kaya would be having a piece. I've heard a lot of people say they've seen a schoolgirl that looks like Miss Kaya... I heard a rumor that she's almost a different person now. That her eyes are sharper, or something. The rumor about Miss Kaya is cropping up everywhere. But, I haven't been hearing it much lately. It was probably a case of mistaken identity. Wouldn't she call home if she really was safe? Honestly, I doubt she's even alive anymore. That poor Miss Rin. Jeez louise, the gawker in me is showing its face again. I can't help myself. I want to go to Tsukudo-Cho so badly that I can't concentrate on what I'm doing here! Darn these impulses! I can't help it; that's just the way I get sometimes. I'm desperate to see what's going on out there! I'm so curious, I can't even eat. The quake was so big, the epicenter must be pretty close by. I've gotta see what's going on out there! Of course, if anyone needs help, I'll do my part. They say that dog people are devoted to others, and that others are devoted to cat people. This boy is definitely a cat person! I bet the girls just go wild when he passes by. Whatever problems this mansion has, at least it's never boring. There's some kind of incident every day. I never want to work anywhere else! What, do the agencies not have enough manpower these days that the pets have to help? If that cat isn't housebroken, you better believe you'll be getting our bill. Your agency must be pretty hard- pressed for warm bodies if they hired a schoolboy like you. Don't think I'll look the other way for a student. You break anything here, you bought it. For a mansion this big, elegance is paramount. Which is to say, don't go rubbing your greasy mitts on everything. You'll ruin the ambiance. Oh, you're still here. Having fun stomping all over our hand-woven carpets? ...Aren't you getting the message? We're busy, and we'd appreciate it if you'd scram. Master Kiyoshi seemed pretty bushed. He kept rubbing his shoulders and wincing. He must have been so tense in that business meeting that he pinched a nerve. We're all very impressed that you're still looking for Miss Kaya after the nonsense with Master Kiyoshi. Really. But, that doesn't mean you can leave smudgy fingerprints on the furniture at your leisure. The vases and the paintings are priceless imports purchased by the previous Daidouji masters. It all looks the same to me, but the important thing is: no touchy. You're probabably already aware that this mansion plays host to many soldiers. The Army soldiers were nodding appreciatively at the art, as if they weren't a pack of Philistines. Some things can't be done without great effort. If you try to blather about moral theory instead, people will just sneer at you. And, rightly so. The Army soldiers haven't been back since their last visit with Master Kiyoshi. They were humbled by the staggering luxury on display. This place didn't come cheap. What were Master Kiyoshi and the soldiers talking about? Say, wait a minute... were they discussing ways to raise money for the factory? Master Kiyoshi's not thinking of selling these paintings to Major General Munakata, is he!? Once the master buys a new piece of artwork, the older ones get dumped into the storehouse. ...Did the soldiers stop coming because we're not necessary, either? Nah, I'm overthinking it. That boss of yours was with a soldier? Doing what, I might ask? Accepting a bribe...? No, it couldn't be. No sense involving his agency when he could keep it himself. Master Kiyoshi isn't here, but he's contracted us to find Miss Kaya. You've been poking around here so often, and now we have the same goal... fate, I guess. Looks like martial law is in effect, from what I can see of the Army in Tsukudo-Cho. If you ask me, it's more like they're occupying the place rather than guarding it. I saw a plume of white smoke when I was staring out the window. Is the Army up to more tricks? Are they testing a new weapon or something? The earthquake shook us up pretty good, but all the paintings and vases are miraculously intact. It's as if it was all glued in place. I'd rather have a dog. A pet's got to be a good companion. Cats are lousy to be around. Cute when they're small, but who wants an old, fat tabby with a surly look? I used to be an art major, but now I'm just a run-of-the-mill servant. But the more I have to stare at all these paintings, the more inspired I got. Maybe I should go for it... Yeah, why not? Don't run around! Don't touch anything! Above all, don't talk to me! If you fail to comply, I'm taking you in! You there! Tell the lady over there to stop looking at me. How am I supposed to focus on the investigation with her staring at me like that? Is Master Kiyoshi all right? Lately, all he does is stare out the window. Before, when Master Kiyoshi was in trouble, Master Daidouji would always lend a hand. Mr. Nakamura warned me not to be careless. Who is calling on Master Kiyoshi today? What can I do to make their meeting more productive? I heard today's guest is a VIP. Will Master Kiyoshi be all right? Will he be able to handle himself in the meeting? Oh, I knew it. Master Kiyoshi's negotiations with the guest were a failure. I knew he wouldn't be up to the task. He can hardly do anything without Master Daidouji's help. After Master Kiyoshi ended his  meeting with our guest, he went up to the living room to brood. He seems to have upset the guest. If only Master Daidouji had been there... Since that incident at Toranomon, I give my watch duty everything I've got. If anyone looks suspicious, I won't hesitate to shoot. Even if it's a servant of the mansion. I can't believe our superior is being so lenient with this guy. If my men were insubordinate, I wouldn't hesitate to shoot.  There's a doll sitting on the floor.  It resembles a hooded woman.  There's a doll sitting on the floor.  It's about the size of an infant. ...... Why won't gramps open his third eye... disappointing, disappointing... he can't see me... A fine day to you, Sir. I apologize if I made things difficult for you earlier. I must admit I am concerned. First Miss Kaya, and now Master Kiyoshi has gone missing... ...Hm? Do I know where Master Kiyoshi might be? Of course not, that's why he's missing. So, you're looking for him as well as Miss Kaya? To be honest, Sir... There's not much I can tell you about Master Kiyoshi. ...Sorry that I couldn't be of greater assistance. If you don't mind, Sir, I do have a request to make. Master Daidouji's condition is rather critical, I'm afraid. Therefore, I have neglected to inform him of Master Kiyoshi's untimely disappearance. However, the other day while the Master was lucid, he told me... Give this to my brother Kiyoshi... I would like nothing more than to do as the Master wishes, but... Because of his illness, I cannot leave his side to deliver it to Master Kiyoshi myself. So... May I ask you to deliver this to Master Kiyoshi for me? That is... if you are able to find him, of course. Master Daidouji and his brother never did get along very well. But, as the end has drawn closer, Master Daidouji's shown interest in making amends... ...however late it might be. I understand this is a lot to ask, but... You are the only person I can trust with this.  Raidou obtained the . Miss Kaya is Master Daidouji's only daughter. If anything should happen to her... I'd be too mortified to show my face to Master Daidouji, or even the spirits of his ancestors. Miss Rin has been Miss Kaya's constant companion since they begun school together. If she interferes, do try to forgive the poor girl. Master Kiyoshi is your host rather than Master Daidouji, but... Do remember that the true master of the house is Master Daidouji. I regret to say, Sir, that Master Kiyoshi is still entangled in his business conference. If you had questions for him, perhaps I can be of assistance instead. I must speak with Kiyoshi....As I believe I mentioned, Master Kiyoshi is in a business meeting. If you have a question, I'd be happy to be of assistance. In that case, Sir, the door is this way. The servants are all occupied with the guests, Sir... Forgive us, but we haven't the time to look after detectives. M-Master Kiyoshi... Master Kiyoshi has become a...! I've had the privilege of serving in this mansion for many decades, b-but this... Wh-What... what should I tell Master Daidouji...? I must apologize, Sir, for the... unpleasantness earlier. Master Kiyoshi has not yet returned. Master Daidouji is bed-ridden at the moment... It seems we cannot escape the Daidouji legacy. Mr. Raidou, please save Miss Kaya. Mr. Iida? I believe Master Kiyoshi has mentioned his name, but I have not met the man myself. I suggest you try his home if you know its whereabouts. I apologize for the inconvenience. M-Mr. Iida was taken? Oh, my. Those connected to the Daidouji family do have a odd tendency to ill fortune... O-Of course it's simply an accident. A c-curse is out the question. You're asking if Mr. Iida has visited, Sir? No, Sir. At present, only the family and the police are within the mansion. Those cuff links are Master Daidouji's prized possession. Master Daidouji leaving them to Master Kiyoshi... I fear that Master Daidouji's health is in doubt. Master Kiyoshi presides over the factory, in addition to various smaller jobs here and there. He'd endlessly roam the factory to check on his workers, always rushing from place to place... His excessive work habits were rather hard on his legs. Master Daidouji once confided to me that he believes Master Kiyoshi is too kindhearted. In order to successfully manage a business, a cold heart is an unfortunate necessity. ...However, Master Kiyoshi's heart is much too warm for the task. I've been... neglecting my calisthenics. I must have fainted from overwork. I'd be too ashamed of myself to meet the spirits of the Daidouji ancestors now... As the butler of this house, I must always expect the worst. I don't wish to dampen poor Miss Rin's spirit, but I have my doubts... Master Daidouji is ill, and Miss Kaya is still missing. Perhaps it's meant to be a silver lining in our cloud of misfortune... That even in circumstances such as these, we can celebrate today... I fear that even if Miss Kaya were discovered unharmed, she may not wish to return... The story about the demon, right?When a Daidouji girl becomes 16, her personality is radically altered and she begins spouting nonsense. That nonsense is regardless treated as prophecy, and it has brought the Daidoujis wealth and status. It is the Daidouji custom for the Master himself to dispose of the girl, to maintain the family honor. ...Despite this, I believe Miss Kaya should return. The family's honor must be upheld, even at such a cost. Still, when I look at Miss Rin... I can't help but wonder what the right thing is. Dear me... In any event, this is a matter for the Daidoujis and the Daidoujis alone. You and I have no business interfering in such things. If Miss Kaya had been a boy, she would have led a very different life. I hope she doesn't resent the Master for the circumstances of her birth. Is there a problem, Sir? Good heavens, you don't look very well. I've been cursed.Oh, my... you always seemed too decorous to say such a thing. If you're speaking in jest about the Daidouji family's terrible curse... Well, I must say, I am rather unimpressed. Yes, well... I suppose I was worrying too much. Still, don't overexert yourself, Sir. I speak from personal experience. Mr. Raidou, what has happened? You're wearing a rather grave look... Tell him about NarumiI understand completely how you must feel. Whether an apprentice detective or a butler, one's feelings toward one's employer are the same. Yes, well... I suppose I was worrying too much. Still, don't overexert yourself, Sir. I speak from personal experience. Wh-What is that disturbance outside? The servants are saying that a mysterious sphere was launched into the sky... It might be related to Kaya...Miss Kaya was looking for the same crystal that foreigner was babbling about? ...At last, I understand the reason for this family's darker customs. I beg of you; save Miss Kaya. Not just for this family, but for everyone in the Capital. ...I thank you, Sir. Your words are somehow a comfort to me. Wh-What is that disturbance outside? That was an unusually violent shaking... This is no ordinary earthquake. It might be related to Kaya...Do you mean to say Miss Kaya was searching for the Soulless God's power source...? The terrible Daidouji curse... If this was the doing of that demon, then... O-Oh my God...! Miss Kaya... What will become of Miss Kaya...!? ...I thank you all. Your words are somehow a comfort to me. The demons are so kind... Wait... What am I saying...? I see... So, that's what happened at Harumi-Cho. Master Kiyoshi's request was for you to investigate the matter of Miss Kaya, was it not? Then you have done an admirable job, Mr. Raidou. We will take care of everything from here on. The case isn't closed yet.Mr. Raidou! This is unexpected, but very generous of you. I will speak to Master Daidouji about a reward upon Miss Kaya's safe return. I shouldn't be so set in my ways, eh? Am I not a butler? Ho ho ho... Well, if the possession of Kaya was the cause of all the Capital's troubles... Then, I shall compensate the citizens as a representative of the Daidouji family. Master Daidouji is still bedridden, you see, and cannot be bothered with such matters. I saw Mr. Kiyoshi in the news! I thought maybe... Kaya would have come home... Maybe she's stuck where she is. Please, mister, save her! You think that Rasputin guy might know something about Kaya? Please, mister, you gotta save Kaya! Please... So if you meet up with this Elfman guy, you'll find out more about Rasputin? And, when we find Rasputin, we'll be able to find Kaya, right? Kaya was at Kasumidai!? Th-That's baloney! People are just saying whatever they think sounds good! What's the connection between Kaya and Kasumidai? Th-That's nonsense. Mister, are you having me on? There was a rumor for a while that Kaya was spotted in Akasaka-Ku. But Kaya wouldn't let herself get caught by the soldiers, and she didn't come find me either... Sh-She'll be back... She'll come back.. O-Our promise... Every year on her birthday, we always hit up the dessert parlor to celebrate. We're gonna go this year, too... We have to... celebrate... K-Kaya, where are you!? Kaya's got short hair? No way, mister. When the modern style was getting popular in our class, we went to the beauty salon... But, Kaya wouldn't do it. She loves that long, black hair of hers. Kaya, where are you...? We were supposed to celebrate your 16th birthday together... Kaya is absolutely alive, no two ways about it! She'll come back! People can say whatever they want, but they're all wet. I'll never stop believing in her. Kaya's awfully sweet, but she's too kind. I bet she didn't leave a note because she didn't want people to worry about her. Kaya can be so bull-headed. She's way too responsible for her own good. She must have ditched the detectives to handle the possession on her own... That's... that's it, yeah... Whatever Kaya does, I'm with her one hundred percent. I'll wait for her... forever, if I have to! I'll wait for Kaya. After all, we're friends, aren't we? Kaya has become...No! Don't say it! Don't say Kaya's a demon! Kaya is Kaya! ...I'm sorry. I didn't mean to bite your head off. ...Thank you, Raidou. You're a pretty swell guy... Gotta check in with your client? Be my guest, but keep it quick. This story ain't gonna write itself. Oh, I'm sorry about that. My neck's been stiff lately... Usually I'd be able to make more time for you, but right now I'm too busy even to sleep. Excuse me, I have things to do elsewhere... Please, find Kaya for me. Oh, I'm sorry, my mind was elsewhere... It's that time already. I'd better be prepared... If you need anything, ask Nakamura. Please... find Kaya for me.  It's a Dragon Cave.

You should be able to tell if anything's nearby. ...He who breaketh my seal is fated to die... If thou wish to transcend death, thou must first transcend mine fury...  A small talisman is stuck to the back of the post box.  There's a mysterious inscription on the talisman... Yep, that's our talisman. Just rip it up, and the seal should vanish.  Break the seal talisman? Aww, man, you did it! But, that curse on you won't disappear anytime soon. Y'know why!? YesCause the great Hitokotonusi's curse is a helluva lot more powerful than our dinky seal! What are you gonna do, beat the great Hitokotonusi? Hah! Like that'll ever happen. Y'know why!? Cause you're gonna be our next meal! That irritating seal oughtta be gone now. How are you holding up, ? Can you still move okay? I'll make it.Attaboy! That's what I expect from Raidou the 14th. We're all counting on you. This is still a pretty dangerous place, though, so let's get a move on, . Yeah, I bet. You've been cursed for a pretty long time by now. But, you're a Raidou; you can't let yourself give up here. Let's go! , there's something there. Looks like there's a special delivery package waiting for us. Hyahaha! You suckers fell for it! They fell for it, brother! So long as us brothers keep this seal up, you'll never reach the great ! So, what you're saying is... the demon behind this curse is called Hitokotonusi, right? Wh-Wh-What!? How does this puny cat know about the great Hitokotonusi!? C-Careful, brother, they're dangerous! Let's send them somewhere else, quick! You suckers fell for it again! Hyahahahaha! You said it, brother! That talisman's powerful, huh? seal talisman or they'll find out that we're hiding it! So, the seal is powered by a talisman, eh? Interesting. Wh-Wh-What!? How does this scrawny cat know about the seal talisman!? C-Careful, brother, they're dangerous! Let's send them somewhere else, quick! Yet again, you suckers fell for our trap! Hyahahahahahaha! You're the man, brother! They haven't even found out where the talisman is! Shut up! Don't talk about the talisman! What would you do if they found out we hid it near the red post box, huh!? Aha... So, the talisman is near the post box. Got it. Wh-Wh-What!? How does this runty cat know where the talisman is!? C-Careful, brother, they're dangerous! Let's send them somewhere else, quick!  A suspicious presence is in the air... it's best to report it to Raidou.  ...! A trap has been activated.  Raidou ripped the seal talisman in two. Eeeek! Y-You're here! I-I-I'm s-s-supposed to guard here. Y-Y-You can't pass here. G-G-G-Go home, please!Eeeeek! D-Don't come any closer! P-Please, give me a break! M-My orders are to not to let anyone through. I-I know! You can't get past the southern pass, right!? Then, I'll let you in on something... The seal on the southern pass needs the talisman to support it. The talisman is really small, though... I hear you won't be able to find it with the naked eye. Only someone or something that specializes in searching for things could have a hope in finding it. How was that? Useful, right!? Come on, Boss, you're killing me here. C'mon, Boss, not this way. You should go through the southern road! You just need to do something about the talisman first. It's so small, you'll need an expert in finding stuff or you'll never find it. Isn't that enough to go on!? I'm trying to help you out here! Just don't pass this way... Eeeeek! D-Don't come any closer! Wh-What? The southern seal has been broken? Then, my job is done! If you could do me a favor, though, pass through the other side whenever I'm here, okay? Please, Boss, have a heart! If they find out I let someone go through, they'll dock my pay. I was going off to work, when all of a sudden these walls appeared and lil' old me was trapped inside. I may have wings, but they're just for show. I can't use 'em to fly out of here. It's awfully sweet of you, sugar. Thanks so much! It's not as rare as you might think for a demon to fall in love with a human. Tee-hee!  The demon isn't interested in ...  The demon has the hots for Raidou.  The demon is glancing over at .  The demon seems interested in . Ooh, what a lovely young fellow. I can feel my heart beating a mite faster! Here, hon, take this. It's a little memento of how I feel. I found this and I think it would be a darling little gift for you!  Raidou obtained   x1.   obtained  x1. You really are a lovely boy. You remind me so much of him... I was going off to work, when all of a sudden these walls appeared and lil' old me was trapped inside. I may have wings, but they're just for show. I can't use 'em to fly out of here. It's awfully sweet of you, sugar. Thanks so much! It's not much, but go on and take this, hon.  Raidou obtained  x1.  Raidou obtained  x1.   obtained  x1.   obtained  x1. By the way, hon, are you going to fight the demon that put up those walls? I plan to.I thought so. Well, I've got a bit of gossip that might come in handy. You know those Utai-gaikotsu brothers, hon? Well, I heard them talking to each other real loud. Their boss has , and they all have a different weak point. What are they specifically? Oh, dearie me, let's see: , . If you plan on getting into a tiff with that thing, don't forget what I told you. If you say so, hon... Just be careful, you hear?  The Herald of Yatagarasu has created a connection between the Real World and the Dark Realm.  It is possible to return to the Nameless Shrine from here. Return to the Real World?  Persons unknown have created a connection between the Real World and the Dark Realm.  It is possible to use it to escape the Dark Realm.  Return to the Real World? YesHoo hoo hoo... I'm Mokoi. But, I know so many things, maybe you should call me Professor Mokoi. I'm not sure there's anything I don't know. If there is, I don't know about it... Do you have a favorite lecture subject? I can expound on it at your leisure. Ask about Shikimi no KageShikimi means border. It's a roadblock, to put it differently. You knew already? Then you get a cookie. No cookie if you thought it had to do with the Sheik of Araby. You can't hurt Shikimi no Kage unless you , get it? Could be fire magic, could be gun attacks... There are lots of possible weaknesses, m'boy. So, Mr. Summoner, you should have lotsa different types of things... excuse me, demons... to summon. But, you should know about all that by now. They've been appearing all over the Capital lately. If you ask me, it's a big, deep conspiracy. Lots of branches and tentacles reaching all over. Investigating that stuff is your bread and butter, right, detective? Maybe I should hire your services. To tell the truth, m'boy, I'm not from the Capital originally. I'm from a land far, far to the south. The giant rock of Uluru is what I call home. One day I'd like to go back there, m'boy. I'm sick of home... I mean, homesick. Cloaks are the new hotness now, you know. Especially the red ones and black ones.  Personally, I like Yumeji's manteau designs. They're so modern. I better not see one on you, m'boy, or I'll know you're just a copycat with no style. Is that so? Call me Mr. Disappointed, then.  Raidou blew the Flute of Rhone.  However, the Large Tarrasque is not in the Dark Realm.  But, the Large Tarrasque didn't come... Hold this man here.  The red-clad soldiers left. So... Any idea why they would drag us into the Dark Realm? . Think they captured that guy, too?  A man is standing inside the show booth, looking worried. I can't imagine he has anything in common with Kaya. Maybe they're just nabbing people at random. ...I doubt they're out looking for devil summoners, either. ...No use waiting to be bumped off. Let's get a move on. Finish these guys off so we can look for Denpachi. Cripes, you're hard-boiled, son. I can't believe you beat those monsters... You gotta bust me outta here before the others come back!  The door is locked. ...Stupid locks. If we can't open it, we can't free him. What about a lock pick? Konnou-Ya might have one...   analyzed the lock.  It's an old-fashioned lock known as an Ebi-Jo.  It's a spring bolt lock where a key compresses springs inside.  Because of its simple design, a  could open it easily. ...Makes sense. Do you think  carries lock picks? Let's go have a look. This poor sap's been a prisoner long enough.  Raidou picked the lock which was keeping the door shut. ...Thanks for saving me; I really appreciate it. ...! Oh no! They've come back! ...You will not escape. . Let's beat feet before reinforcements arrive. I aM ThE God wHO PrOcLaImS EViL or GoOD In A sinGLe wOrD... I Am Hitokotonusi, GoD OF KaTsuRAgi! ThE GRUdge of tHE KunITsu reMaiNs...

There's a hand- written note stuck on it. This cannon is always kept ready to fire. Unauthorized personnel are forbidden to touch it. Keep open flames away from the fuse.  It's an Army cannon.  Given its position and angle, it seems unlikely that it's meant for defense.  The gunpowder and cannonball are already loaded. All that's left is to light the fuse.   lit the cannon's fuse! Hey, easy there. I don't know what you're trying to do, but didn't they teach you in school not to play with fire? Let's quit fooling around here and hurry over to the .  Raidou quickly extinguished the flame. Was that the cannon?

We fooled 'em into thinking it was time to rotate. That should take care of the guards.

Then maybe we'd get somewhere. As usual, the big brass isn't sweating the details. They're strictly big-picture men. They seem pretty keen on catching him, though. He must have gotten his hands on something pretty hot. Nothing that concerns us, I'm sure. Let's get back to our posts. Yeah, orders are orders. Well, we should at least act like we're looking for him.  The Army soldiers continued their complaints as they went back to work... , huh...  That might be Tae's contact. We should check it out. Let's go to the Guard Box. that deserter is hanging around the Guard Box. So, does that mean the soldier posted at the Guard Box... is the deserter? I can't remember if he had a mole or not.

I don't care if you have to force it, just finish the job.  There are deep tracks in the dirt, from a heavy object.  What should Raidou do? Push it It's not budging...  The statue moved... Okay, so the statues are in place. We've got more to do, though. We're detectives, not movers. We've still got to find a way into the Subterranean Shipbuilding Facility. Maybe it's a more complicated procedure...? Could be that statue's just to set off another contraption that wasn't working before. there should be another piece of junk to fool with somewhere. Let's look around, .  There's an engraving on the well. Two fish within the earth have lost their pearls of blue and red. When the pearls shine once more, two great men shall applaud the revival from their pedestals. The wayward fish shall swim the seas once more, taking the future with their fangs and eyes.  The water in the well has receded, revealing an underground entrance.  Go inside? Yes There's no reason to go inside the well anymore.    There's a sound coming from the well...  There's a booming sound coming from the well...  POINT 1 ON  POINT 1 OFF  POINT 2 ON  POINT 2 OFF  Moving to the Subterranean Shipbuilding Facility. ...And, we're here. Have you been to Kasumidai before, Raidou? This is the center of our country, where politicians and military brass get together. This is where he wanted to meet, but... I don't see him. Hmph! Nobody stands up Kichou Asakura... ...Could you be a dear and take a look around for me? The mysterious caller described himself as having . I'm sure he's nearby. There must be lots of people with large moles on their left cheek... I wonder, is it THAT big? If it's bigger than I thought, I'd better get a photo. Hey... Why are you staring at my face like that? This is the wrong guy. His skin is flawless. You don't think I'm that no-account deserter, do you? I'm here to nab that guy and win myself a promotion. ...I heard he was around this checkpoint not long ago. He's been through the same training as the rest of us, so he knows how to conceal himself. But, don't worry. As long as he's in Kasumidai, he's trapped like a rat. ...It's only a matter of time. The only other possibility is that he's collaborating with someone on the outside. Of course, we'd just capture and punish that person as well, so it doesnt make a difference. ...I think we're in a fix. If this deserter is the same mug who called the Capital Daily, Tae's going to be a suspect. We've gotta get Tae out of here, even if it means slinging her over your shoulder. *sigh* Dames are trouble, that's for sure. The deserter's a trapped rat. It's just a matter of time until we catch him. Unless he has help on the inside... ...Isn't this Tae's camera? I don't think a reporter would just leave her camera behind. ...I smell foul play. That doll's a live wire--I'd bet she's got a clue hidden in that camera. ...I'm no photographer, though. How are we going to get at the film?  Raidou obtained .  This is probably something Raidou should examine. I can't seem to escape the monsters these days... ...But, thanks to you, I'm still alive. I wish I could give you something to show my appreciation, but... Oh, that girl in the photograph! Look for her inside the subterranean military facility. If you get lucky, maybe you'll run into her. , just across from Harumi-Cho.  there which serves as an entrance to the base. Just enter the secret passcode and you're copacetic. . Subterranean military facility, huh? It's as good a place to check as any. Looks like we've got a phone call to make. The entrance to the Army's subterranean shipbuilding facility is the phone at Cannon Battery #4. By entering the correct code, the phone booth becomes an elevator. Confirm the codeThe passcode is: 49399221. I suggest you write it down, so you don't forget. It works like any other telephone; just rotate the dial. I'll take care of the girl, so don't worry about her. Leave her to me. I'm a soldier; no harm will come to her. You must go to the Subterranean Shipbuilding Facility and stop Munakata's scheme.  Tae is unconscious. A soldier doesn't need an identity. Unit and rank are more important than personality. With orders from his superiors, a soldier won't hesitate to pull the trigger on unresisting civilians. Those who claim to be a shield protecting the nation instead become a spear against the people. It's no laughing matter. ......  A faint mocking smile spreads across his face.  He has definitely noticed  the camera. ......!?  He can't take his eyes off the photo.  He is looking your way with knitted brow. ......  His lips are firmly closed.  He is sneaking occasional furtive glances at Kaya. ......  He is staring at Raidou as if possessed. ......  He seems to be lost in thought. ......  He is looking at Raidou and eyeing his saber cautiously.  He is looking straight up at the sky. ......  Rivers of sweat are pouring down his neck.  His gaze drifts between the sky and the direction of Koutou-Ku. ......  He wears a wide smile, with hope glittering in his eyes.  The Army inspector's thoughts can be heard... It's not my fault... There could be a shootout at any moment here. Not my fault if he gets hit by a stray bullet... H-Hey... He's not going to take my picture, is he? I'm so camera-shy... I get nervous when a lens is pointed at me. The guy in this picture is wearing our uniform, but... I've never seen him before. Was there someone like this in our unit? I feel like this schoolboy has the scent of blood on him... Not just from a brawl, either... It's like the stench of death... So, who was the spy...? Was there even a spy in the first place? It wasn't a surprise drill or something, was it? Ouran's uniform is pretty cute. Maybe that's why the Army seems to have a thing for Ouran girls... You know, I never noticed before, but this boy has an unlucky face... It's like he's carrying other people's misfortunes... Major General Munakata looked really excited today... I guess he got up on the right side of the bed this morning. Just standing here all day gets tedious... What a bore. Maybe I'll stab this kid for a change of pace. Hmm... So they launched the satellite. Didn't they say they didn't have a source of power? Well, there is that girl who's helping us. I figure it'll work out somehow. The commotion about that battleship monster is Munakata's responsibility, right? He gave all the orders... M-Munakata's the one to blame! ...Judging by that, Harumi-Cho won't last much longer... B-But, that's all Munakata's fault! They can't blame me! Wh-What was with that monster? It was over so fast. I mean, it just stopped all of a sudden. Was it just really weak? A big monster with no real power? Trying to escape from under the Army's watch... What a joke. There's nowhere to hide from my eagle eyes. What's that? A reporter disappeared? Do you think I'm blind!? There's no way that would've escaped my notice! What? That picture was taken here not long ago? Are you blind!? There's no one in front of the statue! Huh? The Dark Realm? ...Are your eyes even open? You sound like you're talking in your sleep. Th-That soldier and woman there... I thought I saw them come out of nowhere... Maybe I'm overworked. Was I watching too hard for others, ignoring my own health...? The officer at the square over there escorted the unconscious civilian home. Still, that smile on his face and the way he wore his uniform were unbecoming of an officer. About that officer who helped the civilian girl... The uniform and insignia were definitely real, but I've never seen his face before... Drop Sadakichi's nameOh? You know him? Sorry, I'm not good with assigning names to faces. Do you know what unit he's attached to? How could I forget such a big mole... That officer with the mole went to take the civilian girl home, but he's yet to report back. ...I feel sorry for the grunts in his unit, if they're under the command of a man like that. We heard the Admiral of the Navy is seriously ill, according to our intelligence officers. The Army's intelligence is far superior to the Navy's, you see. Looks like the Admiral of the Navy has recovered, according to our intelligence officers. The Army's intelligence is far superior to the Navy's, you see. It seems the officer with the mole was... Well, a mole. He's gone now, but our intelligence officers found him out. If I'd known then, I would've torn him a new one right in that huge mole of his. That Navy spy slipped through our fingers, but as far as intelligence goes, the Army has the advantage. People here still talk about the legendary intelligence officer who left a few years ago. The humanoid thing at Harumi-Cho... What is it? I-Is it alive? The humanoid thing at Harumi-Cho... Is it alive...? The way it howled... It was like it was releasing a long-standing grudge against the place... ...I see. So, the Soulless God fell to a civilian's rocket... I suppose that's the difference between your personal resolve and our blind faith in our leader. Are you here on a field trip? I wasn't notified of that... Well then, I admire your passion for your studies! Kasumidai's main buildings are the Army HQ, the Diet Building, and the Supreme Court! Ask about the Army HQIt's right there in front of you! Planning of national defense strategies, staff supervision and training, it's all done here! ...I guess a cadet like me has no business here, really... Simply turn to your left and you'll see it! That's where the Diet members sit around... I mean, where they debate over serious national issues! My duty is to protect the VIPs that bear the Capital's future on their backs! Simply turn to your right and you'll see it! It's the court where civil and criminal cases that are above the special and administrative courts take place. ...Just thinking of appearing before that court makes me sweat bullets! Oh... I-Is that so...? Coming all the way to Kasumidai at a dangerous time like this... Take my advice: leave, before you learn about things you're not meant to know... You're the one, aren't you? You've been spreading rumors of a disappearance at Kasumidai. ...Anyway, leave. Before you learn about things you're not meant to know... I see you around here a lot. I don't really care what you're doing here, but... Even if the troops are no longer on high alert, you shouldn't come to Kasumidai on a whim. Leave, before you learn things you're not meant to know... Even if the troops are no longer on high alert, you shouldn't treat Kasumidai like a hot date spot. Even if the troops are no longer on high alert, you shouldn't come to Kasumidai for no reason. Leave, before you learn things you're not meant to know... ...Count yourself lucky that I even bother to talk to you. Some units respond to a voice from behind by throwing knives first and asking questions later. You heard about the martial law, right? ...What? Who's in charge here? Didn't your teachers tell you about it? If you value your life... Don't make us angry. I got a message from a comrade in Sakuradayama... Koutou-Ku is half destroyed. If that monster comes here, we don't stand a chance, not with these paltry weapons! I got a message from a comrade in Sakuradayama... Harumi-Cho has seen a lot of casualties. E-Even if we combine the world's weapons... We don't stand a chance against that monster! I got a message from a comrade in Sakuradayama... Another giant like the Soulless God has appeared. I'm prepared for the worst. Bring it on, monster! I'll compensate for low firepower with sheer guts!  The tense Army soldier's thoughts can be heard... Civilians can't get enough of military scandals. ...There's no newspaper reporters around, are there...? I don't care what happens to civilians. Let them disappear. Our hands are full with the deserter. There aren't many hiding places in Kasumidai... We've searched everywhere and can't find him. Where is that deserter...? The order to capture the spy has been cancelled, but what if confidential stuff gets leaked? Depending on how things go... We might need to prepare a tombstone for this kid. I feel sorry for the girl, but we might need to prepare a tombstone for this kid. If the Admiral of the Navy dies, Major General Munakata will have the Diet to himself. At last... Major General Munakata's ideals will finally become a reality. The Zero Division, Special Guards in red uniforms under the direct control of Major General Munakata... I've never seen them before. A unit created to be second to none in battle, huh... The military controls the streets with martial law. We could kill this kid if we wanted, and it would just be seen as putting down rebellious forces. I'm surprised we have a deserter. That's a betrayal of Major General Munakata, y'know? And here I thought everyone in the Army felt the same way about Major General Munakata. He's so influential in the Diet, and he's very popular to boot. Come to think of it, Major General Munakata has been acting strange lately... Maybe the deserter was just fed up with him? Strange in what way?It really crushed him when his Super Military Project was rejected. He wasn't as talkative as usual... He also started praying to the gods. Well... I still don't think it's good to desert the Army. How can kappa who fraternize with foreigners protect our Capital? Kappa should act like kappa and go jump in the lake. Kappa should act like kappa and just go snack on some cucumbers. Kappa are just like demons. If you're having demon troubles, go talk to the kappa. I heard there were people swimming near Cannon Battery #4. Probably those Navy kappa. They need to refill the dishes on their heads, y'know. What? You're looking for a crystal? Go ask the Navy kappa. They'll help you search the bottom of the ocean. Someone out there is trying to kill our Capital's civilians? Don't worry about how weak the kappa are; the Army will never let that happen! I heard that some detective got nabbed by those Navy kappa. He should do whatever they say. Shouldn't swim against the tide, not if you're dealing with kappa. Those Navy kappa seem to think Harumi-Cho belongs to them. Well, we have Waden One at Sakuradayama. Koutou-Ku is ours. Us Army soldiers took our positions right after martial law was declared. And look at those Navy kappa... They haven't budged from their nest. Probably scared their head dish will dry up. Those kappa keep saying that the earth is 70% water... But, nothing beats the sky. We can look down on their puny heads. H-Hey... Is Harumi-Cho okay? Even if those Navy kappas are there, against a tornado like that... Even if the Navy kappa are invincible at sea, against a monster like that... H-Hey... The monster isn't entirely gone, right? If the time comes, I'll join forces with the Navy kappa. I-I'm not friends with them! It's just, y'know, we need all the firepower we can get. A photo of an Army officer on duty, meeting with a young lady... The soldier looks suspicious, it's true, but I also wonder about the cameraman who took this photo. If only Major General Munakata's dream could become reality now, when Kasumidai is in disarray... After all, the menace of the Western powers is staring us right in the face. I heard the Diet rejected Major General Munakata's Super Soldier Project. Little did they know we have the prophetess right in the palm of our hands... The prophetess?She's a girl about your age, from some rich family. Thanks to her prophecies, we've been able to exceed several technological barriers. She seems a little funny in the head, but prophets have always been strange people. Count your lucky stars you were born in the Capital. This way, you'll never have to deal with Major General Munakata as an enemy. We got word of an intruder at the Subterranean Shipbuilding Facility. It must be the work of that spy. What's his game? Collecting data, secret communications, preparing men... I can't pin him down. We received instructions from Major General Munakata to forget the intruder at Cannon Battery #4. Let sleeping dogs lie, in other words. An excellent policy. Major General Munakata's ideals will become a reality soon. We got a memo saying the transitional period of our project is complete. Project?All Japanese citizens will soon know the extent of the Super Soldier Project. It's a means to handle foreign threats, proposed by Major General Munakata himself. A project to create limitless power... In other words, an invincible unit! We won't be enslaved by another country! Major General Munakata's ideal is the happiness of the people! If you're a Japanese citizen, engrave today's date in your heart. It will become a national holiday: the day Major General Munakata's ideals become a reality! Did you see it!? The figure of our satellite Tai-itsu, signifying the passion of our Major General. Remember today's date forever: the day Major General Munakata's ideals become a reality! That's the whole scope of the Super Soldier Project? We worked only to build killing machines? Weren't we supposed to repel foreign threats and lead the people!? Was that all a lie!? Major General! Answer me! Major General Munakataaa!! The Super Soldier Project's objective was to destroy the Capital... Major General Munakata tricked us... I can't believe it! An impostor must've switched with the Major General. If not... What were we fighting for?  It's a Dragon Cave. Mysterious power is flowing out of it...  Here, Raidou can record his findings without being disturbed.  Save? Yes Recover health? Yes  and his demons were healed. *sob* *sob* ...Who are you? I've never seen you around here... I'm Nakisawame. I heal everyone... *sob* Welcome. *sob* Welcome. It's a full moon, so... Do you want me to heal you? Yes yen... Is that okay? YesThis may sting a little, but only for a moment...   and his demons were healed.   was healed. *sob* Don't die on me... Please... *sob* So... You're going to die, too... You don't have enough money... *sob* So... You'll die just like all the rest...  Leave the area? Yes It's an elevator.  It looks like humans are unable to reach inside and take the contents.  It's a glowing, red crystal.  The contents inside shift and warp. Take the contents? Yes  fished around for the contents... ......   obtained .  It's a glowing, blue crystal. Take the contents? Yes It's empty.  Raidou obtained .  Raidou obtained .   obtained .   obtained .  There's something on the ground. Pick it up?  Raidou obtained .   obtained .   found something. ......  Raidou obtained .   found something. ......  Raidou obtained .  The Shikimi no Kage has been destroyed. The way ahead is clear.  It's a Tainted Gate. A demon should be able to pass through.  Raidou paid  yen worth of streetcar fare and returned to the detective agency.  Raidou returned to the detective agency.  Raidou didn't have  yen for the streetcar fare.  Gouto covered the rest. ......  Raidou didn't have  yen for the streetcar fare.  The rest of the fare was paid out of Gouto's wallet.  Raidou used the  and returned to the detective agency. . It's about time you paid up for all the times I covered your streetcar fare.  Raidou paid Gouto back for all the times he borrowed money to pay his fare.  All the money Gouto lent to Raidou for the streetcar fare was returned to Gouto's wallet.  It's not that easy to escape from here!  There's still more to investigate.  The Mute ailment prevents the use of that ability.   felt it would be best if Raidou were here.   felt the urge to report back to Raidou.   wondered if Raidou should investigate here, too.  That cannot be used here.   began a solo investigation.   reported the findings of the investigation.   talked animatedly about the particulars of the investigation.   reported to Raidou despite its fatigue.   is eager to pick a fight.  The encounter rate went up.   played it hard to get.  The encounter rate went down.  The effects of Provoke wore off.  The effects of Intimidate wore off.  The effects of Repulse Water wore off.  The effects of the Attract Water wore off.  The effects of the Soda wore off.  The effects of the poison wore off.   tried using Ignite.   tried using Cool Down.   tried searching areas with spiritual energy.   scouted around the area.   returned from the scouting mission.  In this area...     ...were spotted lurking around.  ...no demons were spotted.  As for items left in the area...   have been confirmed.   told Raidou he'd have to to find any hidden items himself. ...none were spotted.   also found   while scouting.  Raidou obtained .   tried a good, hard strike.   tried using the art of mind reading.   filled the air with pheromones.   is spacing out.   looked at the human and was surprised.  It's no use!   is reminiscing about its home.  It seems humans are foreign to .   tried hard to make conversation.  Alas, it was invisible to the human.   hung back bashfully.  The human didn't notice.   winked!  The human didn't notice.   attempted intimidation!  But,  ended up as the one being intimidated.   tried singing a song.  Eventually, it got bored and stopped.   tried getting the first strike.  It was a futile effort.   asked for MAG.  Alas, it was invisible to the human.   asked for money.  Alas, it was invisible to the human.   was startled.  The human turned this way as  tried to make conversation.  ...Or so it seemed. In fact, it was just a coincidence; demons are invisible to humans.   bemoaned the rough treatment it received from .  The demon died and returned to the tube...  Raidou decided to come back and try again later.   is trying to demonstrate its expertise...  Watch the demonstration? Yes  recovered full HP thanks to 's magnificent acupuncture techniques.   recovered full MP thanks to 's magnificent acupuncture techniques.   pressed the wrong pressure point.   took major damage!   pressed a miracle pressure point.  's Strength went up by 1.   pressed a miracle pressure point.  's Magic went up by 1.   pressed a miracle pressure point.  's Vitality went up by 1.   pressed a miracle pressure point.  's Luck went up by 1.   pressed the wrong pressure point.   started to feel queasy.   pressed the wrong pressure point.   started to feel queasy.   was moved by its creative instincts.   turned .   looks sad...   was going to demonstrate its expertise...  But, no one was watching.  's mouth watered.  But,  resisted temptation.   tried acting snobby, so as not to be treated with contempt.   succumbed to the pressure and was unable to talk.   had a bad feeling about this.   stared at the voiceless thing.   stared at the voiceless thing.  You know the saying, Time is money? It means I don't have time to stand here talking. With Victor's contacts, I've been able to broaden my range of products considerably. That's the good part. The bad part, on the other hand... That constant rumbling, clanking racket from the basement... Can't he do anything about it? Eee hee hee... Thanks for the business, boy. Although, you're always buying up things like bullets and medicine... Is detective work really that dangerous? You know that Balm of Life I stocked up on the other day? The foreign trader I bought it from said it can resurrect the dead. It sounds unlikely, but... I'm certainly not testing it on myself. You've been such a good customer, my business is skyrocketing. What can I do for you in return...? Ah, I know. From now on, I'll give you a better price for the things you sell me. If you find rare goods or antiques, bring them here! You've been such a good customer, my business is skyrocketing. What can I do for you in return...? Ah, I know. I'll give you a special discount on your future purchases. Eee hee hee... Not that my prices before weren't eminently reasonable, of course. I was flipping through a crate of dime novels, and they all say that detectives are superior fellows. That's what they say, but then I remember that Narumi is a detective... Well, it's hard to reconcile the two images, don't you think? Eee hee hee... You're becoming a regular customer here, aren't you, boy? Just between you and me... I'll buy your stuff at an even higher rate from now on. A Cretan goddess statue... A Babylonian tablet... A Theban stone jar... A large stag beetle... If it's rare, this is the place to unload it. I mean, sell it. Eee hee hee... Eee hee hee... You're becoming a regular customer here, aren't you, boy? Just between you and me... I'll give you a 20% discount. How's that sound? Just keep buying, okay? I got a new shipment of the latest bullets and clips the other day from my overseas supplier. These have more stopping power than any other ammo you'll find in the Capital. I don't sell these to just any customer, y'hear? Only the ones I know can handle it. Be extra careful when you're walking around with these in your pocket. Trinkets from all over the world end up in Konnou-Ya, the Capital's finest antique shop! Say... You're the new guy from the Narumi Detective Agency. Well, no window shopping! You're in luck today, kid. I've got just the thing! It washed up near the Ushigome-gaeri Bridge, but... ...Looks to me like some kind of ancient relic. I'm afraid it's not exactly cheap, but it's a good buy, I assure you. Welcome to Konnou-Ya, where you can find an item to-- Eh? Say again?  Raidou asked the owner about the availability of a lock pick. Hyeh heh... Yer gonna use it to help someone, are ya? Well, it's none of my business once I have my money. The rest is your problem. I found this little number through the black market... It normally goes for about 5,000 yen, but I'll let it go for a cool 2,000.  Buy the lock pick for 2,000 yen? Yes Raidou obtained the . You don't even have 2,000 yen on you? Forget it, then. Come back with more money if you really want it. Opening old locks should be a cinch with that little skeleton key. ...Just don't cross any lines, young detective. Hyeh heh... Oh, it's you again... So'd you bring that money?  You may now enter . *huff* *huff* I heard... the bell on the door... But, if I knew it was... you, I wouldn't have... run here... ...You're welcome to purchase what I have here, but don't forget about Harumi-Cho, all right? Oh, Raidou! Thank you for handling my little problem. My merchandise just arrived, so I can set my prices back to reasonable levels. ...Thank you again, son. This is Konnou-Ya, a distinguished dealer of antiques. If you--bwah? ...Am I good with cameras? Why do you ask?  Raidou explained Tae's disappearance. Hm... Hmm... ...Hmmm. I see. So, you're thinking there might be a picture with a clue in this camera. Eee hee hee... Why didn't you just ask me to develop the film? As long as you're paying, I can do whatever you need. I'd say 3,000 yen should just about cover it.  Pay 3,000 yen? Yes Raidou paid 3,000 yen and handed over the camera. ...Sorry about the wait. Here is your photograph. It is an odd one, though.  Raidou obtained the  with a soldier.  You may now enter . That certainly makes it look like they wandered into the Dark Realm, doesn't it? ...Which means, of course, we're the only ones who can save them. Short on yen, eh? Then I'm afraid my hands are tied. Come back with more money and I'll be happy to help. So, you're back... Did you rustle up the clams, as you kids say? There you are, kiddo... Here's the merchandise. Tell Mr. Narumi it needs to be handled with care, all right?  Raidou obtained the . Geez... What on earth did he order, anyway?

This is anno 1980. Got an urge for the wayback? Null sweat. In the Akarana Corridor, you can slide back there in two picos. I'm pressing on ahead.I grok. Well, good lotto. I'll vox you this, though... It may be the future, but there's no surefire that you've got a hope, y'know? Grok that well. Let me surefire that I've grokked you right: you want to slide back to your hometime? Never mind.Scrug yeah! Visiting the golden wayback is... how did you teeps say it... the berries!   stares at the astral body. This is the anno 2030. It's a long way from your hometime. You've slid so far... don't you yearn for the wayback? I'm pressing on ahead.Well, I won't ice you. I've vidded the future, me. I don't know what you're expecting, but... Let me make sure I grok you. You wanna slide to the wayback, right? On second thought, no.That's the shiny of a teep's hometime. It's there for you whenever you need to slide back.   stares at the astral body. Dost thou see the contraption behind me? 'Tis known as an Hourglass. 'Tis said it presides over memories, and createth warps in space and time. None ken its true name, nor the logic by which 'twas constructed. A strange contraption indeed. 'Twould be best if thou went hence from here. Lots of things wash up here. Demons, astral bodies, even items. Every time I clean this place... Good thing for me, those things are lost in the space-time continuum. I don't have to straighten up for guests since quantum uncertainties make it all invisible anyway. It's hard to remember, since I can still see them, but it saves on the cleaning bills. Oh, dear. An inspection. I see, I see. Maybe I should go have a look-see. Heheheh... Sorry, pal, but you ain't gettin' by me. A frail in a sailor outfit? She went through that teleporter back there, the one on the left. That one had a glare that could curdle milk. So much for sugar and spice and everything nice, eh? We've been all over the world, and we've finally settled down in our own pad here. Give us items, sawbucks, whatever bribe you want, but we ain't movin'. They tell me there's a hidden stash somewhere past that teleporter on the right. I ain't movin', so if you want to check it out yourself, be my guest.   tried appealing to the two demons. Heeeey... This feels pretty good, don't it? Wow, yeah... This is the stuff! It's been building up lately, too. Amen to that... I haven't gotten any satisfaction in forever.  Raidou asked them to move. No prob. Just a little more... Just a little while longer, okay? Oh, yeah... Phew! I feel alive again. Yeah, going without that is no way to live. Anyways, we made a promise, man to man, and we're men of our word. Go on through. Whew...  Oni and Ikusa cast a withering glare at ...   lost its nerve and pulled back. There are a lot more whippersnappers nowadays who don't know how to respect their elders. They try to act big when they come here, but they can't fool a sharp buzzard like me. Young guys like that have just one thing on their minds: some good old- fashioned lovin'. Dammit! Dammit! Goddammit!! Why can't I get any further!?  He's so enraged that he can't hear anything you say to him.  Ukobach's anger begins to subside... Hey, sorry about all that. I get kinda hotheaded. I heard a tip on how to get past here, but it ain't going so hot.  *sigh* ...I cannot seem to make any headway. Am I such a simpleton that I cannot comprehend such base matters as these?  He is too downhearted to notice anyone else.  A small flame started burning in Oukuninushi's heart... I am in your debt. Thou hast filled my heart with gladness. Forthrightly, I have learnt a hint to proceed, but I have yet met with no success. Work together. Let your friend go last. What devilry is that? This is a special place: the left and right paths are infinitely connected. If you take the wrong paths, you'll never advance. I know which one is right, tee hee. Do you? No, tell me.It's a secret. Tee hee! Sure, but... does it work for humans? Doesn't it count as incorrect?  Nekomata's thoughts can be heard. The correct path is left, right, right, but that'll be my little secret.  BeYOnD heEEeeErrrRRrE!

I'm just saying, you know, it's impossible without... well... some kinda hint. Alright, that'll be... hmm... 30,000 yen? Yeah... 30,000 yen. Money makes the world... spin? No, it makes the world... go round. Yeah, that's what they say... If you don't have the dough... You're better off dead. Probably. Don't you think...? So, 30,000 yen, yes, that's it. Buy itGood move. It's a wise purchase you've made. You won't regret it... Oh. You'll... want the code.

Everyone else got a lame item, but mine turned out to be pretty cool. I wonder why... Maybe it was that funny feeling I got when warping. It went fine for everyone else, but   The atmosphere changed... Do you want to return? Yes......  A cold power of incredible proportions emanates from the space- time continuum beyond the light...  Face the final enemy? Yes Raidou obtained  x1.   obtained  x1.  Raidou obtained  x1.   obtained  x1.  Raidou obtained  x1.   obtained  x1.  Raidou obtained  x1.   obtained  x1.  Raidou obtained  x1.   obtained  x1.  Raidou obtained  x1.   obtained  x1.  Raidou obtained  x1.   obtained  x1.  Raidou obtained  x1.   obtained  x1.  Raidou obtained  x1.   obtained  x1.  Raidou obtained  x1.   obtained  x1.  Raidou obtained  x1.   obtained  x1.  Raidou obtained  x1.   obtained  x1.  There's something on the ground.

It is the pathway I traveled in order to possess the girl. I can imagine nowhere better suited for our final confrontation. Come, Fourteenth... If you truly wish to forge your own path... then prove to me your resolve! You claimed to accept your fate, yet you've come this far... ...You will regret it. Let's see how worthy you really are, Raidou Kuzunoha! If all had gone as planned, history after Taisho 20 would have taken a different path... But, because of you, no one will ever see the new future I dreamt of... Are you satisfied, judging right and wrong with your own eyes, blinded from the truth!? What you've done will result in a future ruled by vile fanatics... Society under total control... Freedom as seen from within a cage! Should they be the ones to shape the course of history!? No, I wish for a world created by my own hands--my own power! But, none of this makes any difference now, Raidou the 14th. You've managed to preserve Taisho 20 with minimal change... As I failed to alter history, I will wander forever as a lost soul-- banished from my own time. ...Yes, I lost everything. My dreams, my hope, my pride... That's why I'm here to let you know, I can really break it down. Y-You showed up in your skin? Frag, dude, that could be problemacious. You're supposed to transcribe yourself prior, you know? Unless you want to get unstuck in time... Comrades, gather...! Under... flag of... Imperial Way Faction... There are two modes of speccies in the Akarana Corridor... Us time tourists, who come here volitional to vid the sights... ...and those lost souls, who haven't even sassed where they are. ...have conferred and agree that Japan shall be given an... to end this war. Time tourism is where you skim off a person's psyche and send it kicking through history. You can't hitch your body for two gold reasons: One is to keep the tourist safe, and the other is to ice any roughage of official history. We will not walk in fear, one of another. ...remember that we are not descended from fearful men... ...not from men who feared to write... speak... to defend causes... unpopular... Us time tourists are here, but we're not in the skin. You're voxing with my psyche right now. Scrugs that we couldn't meet one-to-one. That's one small... step for man... ...one giant leap... mankind! Hail, good sir! Shall I melt you some diamonds to make a gem even larger and more exquisite? Or, perhaps you'd like my herbal tea that will cure you of hunger forevermore? I may seem to be in the prime of my youth, but I'm actually over 300 years of age. Who... are you?My good sir, allow me to introduce myself: people call me the Count of St. Germain. Well then, my work in this time period is accomplished; what era shall I enrich next? Well met, my good sir ! I pray we meet again someday. ...I have no memory of it, no. I don't recall accepting any 100 peanuts. ...no memory... Who is this Shadow Shogun you're referring to...? I heard there was some occult mode of time traveling in the wayback days. They'd vox really long strings like Tohokami-blah-blah-blah. Pretty turvy, isn't it? ...had it with... this wall... ...going west... nothing's... stop me... Secur... production quotas be... I'll cruise down... autobahn in an American...! I'd vade the next 20 years if our skins were flipped. It's just common sense. All the afterjuju of the Great Flood is still around, so it's bad lotto. Wh-What are you doing!? Hurry, take cover! The ambassador has launched the ICBMs! In under 30 seconds, Tokyo will be... Here it comes! You slid from Taisho year 20? What are you voxing? Taisho only lasted for 15 years. Didn't you vid your history holos? ...Ahh, I grok you. Now I catch it. What do you mean?The men upstairs won't brook any history that doesn't sync with canon. So they slid an operative down the Akarana Corridor to retcon it. Some tera-level Dark Summoner, name of Rasputin. The teep's been off the grid, though, ever since he last voxed with them from some church... Off-the-record history, huh? That's not something you vid routine. Only they who keep sacred their love of God will enter the kingdom of heaven. The Great Cataclysm of 30 years past is a test of faith from our God. I heard there was a teep who tried transcribing onto wayback relatives with DNA manips. The teep's black science was tight. Learned the ways of the devil something-or-other. I don't know what I'd do in the wayback, but that seems kinda turvy to me. Thank goodness for unification. My wife was a Messiah, y'know. We owe a lot to that schoolboy with the gadget on his arm, who defeated all the gods and demons... So your name's Raidou, too? I know a Raidou. The teep was a Templar Knight, with some tera-level skills. Could have gone upstairs someday. But no, not that teep. Just vacated the Center one day, said I have a task greater than this. The Center took mercy on the slow and the stunted. They were given a purpose in life: to work at the Factory. They will fulfill that purpose unto death. You! You're...! Don't you remember me? We talked at the junkyard by the river. I was the dog. I was foolish to have ever believed in your kind! Humans are full of empty promises! How many of our homes will they destroy before they are satisfied!? You're no better than the rest of them! Do you even remember the dream you told me that day at the river? Tell him your dreamDon't come back! I never want to see another human's face! It won't be easy, but... I'll try to have faith in humans once more. I'm still not comfortable with words, so I'll thank you with actions. Come with me! Follow himAs long as there are humans like you, my home forest will live forever, if only in my dreams. Dreams are what we live for, and humans are no different. Our dreams... Never forget them. ...You remembered it... As long as there are humans like you, my home forest will live forever, if only in my dreams. It won't be easy, but... I'll try to have faith in humans once more. I'm still not comfortable with words, so I'll thank you with actions. Come with me! I knew it! You're just like all the others! Dreams are what we live for! I thought they mattered to you, too!  It's a Dragon Cave. Mysterious power is flowing out of it...  Here, Raidou can record his findings without being disturbed.  Save? Yes Recover health? Yes  and his demons were healed. *sob* *sob* ...Who are you?

Phew, what a hassle. Let me give you a hand. Do you wanna know how many are left to find? Let's see how many you've got so far. Hey, you've got the full set! You don't need to waste your time here anymore. Whoa, just one more! You guys must want those reports something fierce! Hey, two more to go. You're almost there! Three more left.

An old man with a mole was playing hee-and-seek, ho. He-ho was hiding behind that hee-house, inside the tiny hee- hole, everywhere... But, they found him every time, ho. He's not very good at hee-hiding for an adult, ho. I'm better than him, ho! Hee ho! I want to meet-ho that hee-old man who was playing hee- and-seek, ho. I'll hee-show him how good I am, ho! Actually... There was a zombie shambling around with a piece of paper in its hand. You could try to pry it out of his cold, dead fingers. I heard this area is some important facility in the human world. You've got to watch out for the humans. They're always coming up with dangerous ideas. You want a piece of paper that the human dropped? I don't know anything about that... Nothing good comes from getting involved with humans.  It's a cannon.  It's an Army cannon.  Given its position and angle, it seems unlikely that it's meant for defense.  The gunpowder and cannonball are already loaded. All that's left is to light the fuse.  The cannon was ignited. (During the fadeout, the sound effect of the cannon) Was that the cannon? Is it lunchtime already? It seems kinda early for that. You're imagining things. I'm hungry, let's go eat lunch. All right, time to change shifts! Let's eat! No, let's turn on the radio! I love that announcer's voice...  The soldiers were fooled into taking their lunch break early.  It's an Army cannon used to signal the noon shift change.  The cannonball is gone, but there's still some gunpowder left.  It could still shoot another round if something was loaded into it.  This cannon seems to be a reasonable size... Load a demon Raidou has a demon that can ignite fuses... Light the fuse ......  The demon returned with cuts and bruises all over its body. It gave Raidou a withering glare.  The demon's HP has dropped, and its loyalty has decreased by 10.  The demon doesn't seem to be coming back...  The demon was in the Guard Box.  The demon retrieved an item from the Guard Box.  Raidou obtained ???.  The demon's HP has dropped, and its loyalty has decreased by 10.  How did the demon land in the Guard Box with that trajectory?  Raidou asked the demon, but it didn't know.  You can only go to the other side by controlling a demon. However...  In the actual game, you can change demons, but not go to the other side. We're Zombie Officers. We always patrol with a partner. You're looking for some documents, I understand? There was a human running all over the place... Now that you mention it, I did see him drop some pieces of paper. We're sworn to protect and serve the citizens of the Capital! We'll do everything we can to help. Everything we can remember, anyway. Sir! If you have any problems, don't hesitate to ask us! Salute! Which section of the report are you looking for? Page 1.Oh, you're short on MAG. Come back when you have more. Sir! Which report do you need information on? Page 5.You seem to be short on MAG, Sir! Feel free to come back later. Yeah, I saw that one by a weapon. Not just any weapon, Sir! A huge weapon! Be careful to extinguish any fire before approaching it! It was near a cool customer. He seemed pretty familiar, like I'd seen him somewhere before. Sir! Humans call it a snowman, though it is far from abominable, Sir! How should I put this...? It was in a common, everyday place. Sir, I saw it nearby! It's behind the bushes of the three-way intersection, Sir! That one I saw near a huge gate. The human tried to hide between the walls, but my keen vision spotted him anyway, Sir! I saw him in a small hole, Sir! In the bushes, to be precise. I remember being surprised he could even fit in there... only the smallest demons can do it. It's in a place with a good vantage point, Sir! The location is a complete dead-end. Oh yeah... There was a weird statue around there, too. Sir! I saw that one myself, on top of the tree! That human shimmied up the tree like he was being chased by a bear. Sir! That one... uh... Oh, no... you forgot again, didn't you? I apologize, Sir! The rot in my brain is advancing, and I can't help but forget things. Sir, perhaps if I had some kind of , it would jog my memory. Wow! You've really lit a fire in my mind! It's all coming back to me now, Sir! Hey, that was pretty refreshing! It's all coming back to me now, Sir! Yow! That shock sure shook some things loose. It's all coming back to me now, Sir! Now I remember, Sir! I distinctly recall someone stealing a document. What!? Well, he better not think he'll escape the emaciated arm of the zombie law. Sir, we must bring him to undead justice! A fellow officer stole that document. Don't worry, Sir! We'll lure him out somehow. Go to the gate on the east side, and wander around there. He's bound to show up, Sir! Roger that. Be aware that you won't find everything using only Inspect. Understood, Sir! Don't forget that you can't find everything if you just Inspect. Hmm... You've already got that one, it looks like. You're already in possession of that section, Sir! I've been serving on the zombie force for seventeen years now. It's a pleasure to meet you. Sir! Dark Kasumidai is all clear! Are you new to the area, Sir? I don't recognize your face. You new around here? I don't think I've seen you before. We are on patrol right now, Sir. We always patrol with a partner.  The Herald of Yatagarasu has created a connection between the Real World and the Dark Realm.  It is possible to return to the Nameless Shrine from here. Return to the Real World?  Persons unknown have created a connection between the Real World and the Dark Realm.  It is possible to use it to escape the Dark Realm.  Return to the Real World? YesBoooom... Over there...  over there... I'm too big... Can't enter it. So sad... Arooooooo! I'm leaving... Going on a trip.  The demon left. Don't follow me, please. ! Over there! We'd better grab Tae before they zombify her! You won't pry them out of our cold, dead hands! Wow, you really saved our bacon... What the hell is going on? We were just talking and... ...Just my luck, huh? I meet this doll of a reporter and monsters gotta ruin everything. ...You a friend of hers? She's on the ground, there. I can't tell her anything if she's unconscious. . I'm afraid I'm the deserter everyone's talking about. The stuff they were doing... I couldn't take it anymore. So, I decided something had to be done. ...I want the world to know what's really going on behind closed doors!  is heading up a suspicious project. He's stockpiling high-tech weapons to strengthen the military and enrich our country. The longer I worked on the project, the more my own actions disgusted me. Finally, I slipped away when nobody was looking, and contacted the media. ...You don't understand! They're not even human! It's an army of monsters--the Special Guards are the living dead! Being involved at all is enough to drive a man to madness... It was so terrible... I just had to get out. I... managed to grab some files as I escaped. You know... in case I needed some dough on the fly. I'd let you see 'em, but... At some point, I think I dropped them accidentally. You wouldn't mind going back to look around, would you? You make short work of all these monsters; it shouldn't be too hard to find the files. I need those to blow this thing wide open. I need your help to find them, okay? That didn't take much time at all. ...I'm ready to tell you everything I know, now. They're centering their horrific project right... here. It's called the Super Soldier Project, and Major General Munakata is in charge. It involves the construction of an unsinkable ship by remodeling some old battleship. They're going to fill it with the undead soldiers, the , and then send it abroad. That entire army of Red Soldiers is directly under Munakata's command... It's an army of corpses: a soulless army! I know I sound all wet, but it's true! Every word! ...Once you see their underground facility, you'll believe me. It's full of... unnatural things. The only humans involved are Munakata and that girl he always keeps nearby. *shiver* I can't stand it. ...A girl, huh? Why don't you show him Kaya's photograph?  Raidou showed Sadakichi the photo of Kaya. That's her! That's definitely the same girl! She's always next to Munakata, discussing who-knows-what. So, how do you know her-- ...I came in pursuit of the coward, but methinks new prey is afoot! ...How long has that guy been here!? None shall interfere with my Dark Lord's machinations! You shall perish here! I'll have more details once you've picked up all the reports I dropped. I'm depending on you.  Tae is unconscious.  It's a Dragon Cave. Mysterious power is flowing out of it...  Here, Raidou can record his findings without being disturbed.  Save? Yes Recover health? Yes  and his demons were healed. *sob* *sob* ...Who are you?

It seems no one is home.  There is a notice posted on the door. I've gone to visit my parents.  It's a house.  There's a woman inside doing her daily chores.  It's a wooden row house.  A man is lounging around inside wearing nothing but his underpants.  It's a wooden row house.   found out how vulnerable a man in his underpants really is.  It's a wooden row house.  The woman inside is trying to soothe her crying baby.  It's a wooden row house.   looked into the crying baby's eyes.  The baby giggled happily.  It's a Japanese-style house.  It looks so rickety, you're sure that it will fall apart if someone sneezes...  It's a Japanese-style house.   was baffled why anyone would hang a flower pot from the ceiling.  It's a Japanese-style house.  Various types of sandals are lined neatly near the door.  It's a Japanese-style house.   couldn't take all the sandals staring at it, and ran off.  It's a wooden row house.  The boy inside is practicing his penmanship on an empty orange box.  It's a wooden row house.   could smell a citrus-y scent coming from the crate the boy was using as a desk.  It's a wooden row house.  Old issues of the Daily Capital have been hung up to cover the broken glass.  It's a wooden row house.   discovered a swallow's nest under the canopy top.  It's a Japanese-style house.  Newspapers and flyers are piling up underneath the door.  It's a Japanese-style house.   doesn't need its sixth sense to tell that there's no one inside.  It's an old rickshaw.  It appears to have been in service for quite some time, but it's been well-maintained.  It's an old rickshaw.   could feel the owner's passion for his work infused into the cart...  It's a small hole.  It's a small hole, but this demon could probably fit inside.  Go inside? Yes Exit the hole? Yes There's no one here. temp message temp message temp message temp message temp message temp message temp message temp message temp message temp message temp message temp message temp message temp message temp message ExamineExamineExamineExaminetemp message temp message temp message temp message temp message temp message temp message temp message temp message temp message temp message temp message temp message Yestemp message temp message i'm going to be the star of metal gear solid 5 metal summoner yes, miss tron! doink Scram, kid, quit botherin' me!

I can't help myself-- I have to look! Heheheh... Huh...? Crap! My human form slipped off! Hey, you! You never saw this, okay? Please? Peeping on humans is the only fun I get in life! Look, here, I'll give you my prized possession! Just take this! And remember, you never saw this, okay?  Raidou obtained  x1. It's settled, then! But, come to think of it, usually humans can't see me in demon form anyway. So even if I am in demon form, I could still peep all I wanted... It's tempting, but on the other hand, it's kind of fun to live like a real human, too. Which is better...?  The demon left to ponder the question...  The store is closed. It hardly seems like the same shop that was so busy not long ago...  There's no one in the building.  The house is empty.  It's a wooden row house.  A man is lounging around inside wearing nothing but his underpants.  Right next to him is a sack full of his belongings.  The house is empty.  On further inspection, there's an Army soldier lying on the ground.  Right next to him is a broken flower pot.  Raidou blew the Flute of Rhone. You again, Kuzunoha? Who're you after this time?  Raidou showed Satake the photograph of Shizu. ...Denpachi's sister, huh? Did he ask you to find her? Cause y'see... She's kind of in . Her husband was attacked while on the job, and he got taken to the hospital, see? ...When I say husband, I don't mean to imply they were married. They were waiting to sign the papers until her brother finally saw fit to approve of them. But... After the accident... She said she needed a lot of dough for the hospital bill, and offered to take any job I had. She was prolly too embarrassed to ask her brother for the money, since he was sour on the whole thing. She requested a job where a woman like her could make some fast cash... ...She's one helluva girl. What, you're gonna go see her? Heh... A kid like you'd get booted out of there before he knew his boys'd dropped. ...Alright, look here. I'll call Shizu up and have her meet you at the edge of the Red-Light District. I'll let the gatekeeper know yer coming, too. So get a move on. They only went that far because they were protecting their turf. Go easy on 'em, will ya? You run into Denpachi? The guy's old-fashioned and hard- headed, but he's a good guy. Don't be too hard on him. I know eloping and turning to the bathhouse ain't what they teach you in finishing school... But, that's the answer Shizu came up with after thinkin' hard about it. Don't go preachin' to her, get me? She's just like her brother. If you want her to listen, y'better show some good faith. She comes on strong, but Shizu's still a dame. Maybe she wants someone to lean on. Fate must've brought you two together or something. I've got a request for you: help Shizu. I heard about Denpachi from Shizu. It seems like he caused ya some trouble. I owe y'one, Kuzunoha. They say Kiyoshi's a loser, but the workers loved him. I hear some of 'em ignored the eviction notice and shut themselves in the factory... Hey there, Kuzunoha! Workin' another case? So, you wanna know about Harumi-Cho? The other day it was Senju-Ku, and now it's Koutou-Ku? Detective work keeps you moving, eh? Don't worry about it. Here's what I know... Harumi-Cho is like a small town of merchants. This mug, Harada, used to be the big cheese of the trade industry in those parts. Then, there was this really good foreign merchant... Elfman, I think. Anyway, different race or not, those two worked together and helped each other out. Real touching story, right? Anyway, then Harada died... Elfman shut out all the Japanese merchants so foreigners could rake in the clams. Now, I don't know about this next bit, but I've heard rumors he's got friends in the military. So, Elfman kind of rules the roost down there at the moment. Eh? An illegal alien? ...... I dunno... But, it's a definite possibility. It ain't hard to sneak into the country... if you've got the right ship. For someone with Elfman's influence, it wouldn't be a problem at all. But then, how do you plan on proving he snuck someone in? You ask Elfman directly, you ain't getting a straight answer. Yeah, this Elfman doesn't exactly seem on the up-and-up. ? Give it a try anyway? I hope Elfman doesn't mind if we pay him a visit. *grin* Heard ya handled the trouble at Daidouji's joint. It was all because of my lack of supervision. I'm in debt t'both of ya. There's an ugly rumor going around that Elfman has teamed up with the military's top brass. Yeah, well, it takes one to know one. Be careful, ya hear? It might be private property, but that's one hell of a church. There has to be complaints from the locals. How much did he buy them off for? Hmmm, so you're goin' to Kasumidai. I can sympathize with Narumi. Nah, it ain't my place to tell ya. He'll fill you in when the time comes. Narumi's gun's an automatic, I hear. It's standard issue in the German military. He could at least lemme know his supplier... Sadakichi? I got a lotta dirt on the Army... But that's a name I don't know. ...Wonder if he's new. Hey, Kuzunoha... Who you lookin' for today? ...Ah, it's someTHING this time. You're certainly a busy man. So, what do ya need?  Raidou described the crystal to Satake. ...Irie Fudou, huh? Never heard of it. Sorry, kid. Afraid I can't help you out on this one. ...... Look, there's this guy in Senju-Ku... He's sort of an odd duck, but he's a real know-it-all. I'd suggest you pay him a visit. He lives at this joint he calls the Amazing Science Lab. Your guess is as good as mine. ...Wouldn't hurt to ask him, anyway. There's only one thing I can imagine Narumi ordering from Konnou-Ya. ...I'm not going to be the one to tell ya. When he's ready, he'll tell you himself. I don't give a damn about what the Army does. We're not some do-gooder reformist group here. But, if they intrude on our turf, that's another story. We'll crush 'em. Tsukumo's a strange guy, but he seems earnest enough. Otherwise, there's no way he coulda kept on making that strange thing. They say the Navy doesn't leave ya a single tooth when they're done interrogating you. Surprised Narumi made it back in one piece. How much did he slip 'em? I heard the Army and Navy are raising a ruckus... As the big cheese around here, I can't just ignore 'em. We're ready for battle. ...Narumi came by to say thanks. Thank you for your cooperation, he says. Boy had a gun under his jacket. ...He's planning to die. This haori isn't just for looks. It's proof of resolve for the man in charge. ...If they come at us, we'll respond with force. We ain't bright enough to know how to hold back, y'know. There goes a couple of ribs. It's been a while since I used my fists. Don't worry about Senju. I'll protect this place, no matter what! Kuzunoha, you've been fighting beasts like that all this time...? Leave Senju to Kenzo Satake. You have something else to do, right? So, what the devil happened? You show that monster what for? If that were the case, it'd be cause for celebration, but... ...things don't seem so copacetic on your end, Kuzunoha. I take it whatever's eating you ain't something you can share with the class. I won't ask what it is--cause that's not my business. ...I will say this, Kuzunoha. In difficult times, a man's gotta lift his head and keep moving. So you keep your head up and do what you gotta do. Hear me? It's what separates the real men from the saps. No question. And, I know you've got moxie, kid. So get out there and do it! We've got yer back, as always.  The Amatsu Kanagi began to glow in response to Satake's words. ...Don't die, Kuzunoha. The world needs more mugs like you. Anytime you need a relaxin' bath, Daikoku-Yu is the place, all right? Looks like the Amatsu Kanagi is gaining power. ...Still not enough, though. We still need more power, . Move on to another person. You'll need to perform the ritual at Ushigome-gaeri Bridge. The game's afoot, Raidou! Let's settle this once and for all! The red in this haori is a sign of my leadership. There was a time I worried about responsibility and all that noise. But, when I thought about how much these people meant to me, I got over it. ...What do you want, kid?  . It's no playground. Why the hell are you milling around here, anyway? I'm looking for someone. Raidou explained that he was looking for someone. ...What, so like, you a cop or somethin'!? ...Don't be a sap. The cops don't hire children. ...Lookin' for someone, huh? You understand, we can't have people sniffin' around our turf. If you want to look around here, you need to get permission from the boss. See that Daikoku-Yu public bathhouse behind me? Go inside and pay him a visit. If he says okay, then we won't give you the runaround. But, we'll understand if you get too scared to meet him in person. ...The Yakuza's involved in all kinds of turf wars. We don't have much choice but to cross that line. Let's go talk to this so-called boss, . Haw haw! Seriously? Try back again in ten years, kid! . I don't think they appreciate your joke. Just give 'em a straight answer. If you don't have no business, then scram! I am impressed, though. You're one tough nut, unlike most'a these goons. ...So, what brought you here to our humble bathhouse? ...A detective!? You work for Narumi, huh? Raidou Kuzunoha... Yeah, I'll remember that name. . Nice to make your acquaintance. ...So what are you here to investigate, Kuzunoha?  Raidou explained that he was looking for someone. I'll let you in on a little secret, Kuzunoha. We know all about the goings-on in the Capital. We'd be able to track someone down a lot better than some two-bit gumshoe, that's for sure. I gotta admit, you've got moxie. You come let me know whenever you need to find someone.  Ask about Kiyoshi Daidouji.That Daidouji chump? Yeah, I know that mug. He was doin' pretty well with that spinning mill of his, for a time. ...But, he's lost a lotta' money since then. Come t'think about it, I haven't seen him lately. ...Sorry, kid. I don't got a clue where he might be. Denpachi? ...Rickshaw runner? Oh, that guy workin' at Ryugu. If you leave here and walk down the road, you'll find his house in skid row. But... You'll stay away from there if you know what's good for ya.  have been through that area a lot these past few days. They've been causing their share of trouble, too. ...... But, if you're stuck on going, I'm not gonna stop ya. Just try not to attract any... unnecessary attention. We still don't have anything to go on, . Think we should ask him some more questions? That's a rickshaw, alright. ...Think this could be where Denpachi lives? It looks like nobody's home. Arrest the intruder. Hey, these are the same saps who kidnapped that girl at the Ushigome-gaeri Bridge... What are they doing here, and why did they send so many troops? ...Let's play along. It might lead us closer to Kaya. Phew... Thanks again. I dunno what would've happened to me if you hadn't come along. ...Who are you, anyway? A detective...? At your age? My, that really is something! Oh, how rude of me... My name is . I'm a rickshaw runner. Did... Did you come here looking for me? Imagine that! We stumbled across the same guy we were looking for. ...Ask him about Kiyoshi!  Raidou inquired about Kiyoshi Daidouji. The president of the factory? Yeah... I know him pretty well. So, you're looking for information on him? ...Sir, I'm afraid I can't reveal any information about that client. People expect a certain amount of confidentiality from their rickshaw runners. ...... But... Perhaps if you... did me a favor... If you can find my sister... I'll tell you what I know about Mr. Daidouji.  ran away from home some time ago. She eloped with a taxi driver, of all people. I can't agree with what she did, but... She is my only sister. Here's a picture of her. Please... I'm begging you. You have to find Shizu for me.  Raidou obtained the . Nothing is simple anymore. ...Oh well, guess we have no choice. ...In order to find one dame, we gotta track down another one. *sigh* Any idea where to start? ...Are you the person who wanted to see me? I received a message from Mr. Satake to... ...We've met before, haven't we? At Kurisu-zaka? You're a detective? I see... Did you need me for something?  Raidou explained the situation to Shizu. So you're saying my brother wants me to come back home. ...... ...I can't. I won't go home until the man who attacked my husband is found! I can't leave him right now... He's seriously injured. If you aren't going to back down, . ...Now if you'll excuse me, I have... work to do. Now we're looking for someone ELSE!? They certainly have a lot in common, don't they? We are not operating a charity organization here! *sigh* ...Better get back to the office and ask Narumi about this.  Shizu walked away. Were you able to track him down?  Raidou showed the rickshaw knob to Shizu. That's...! It's from my brother's rickshaw! I know without a doubt! But, he wasn't-- No, he couldn't... He's the one!? *gasp* Wait...! I-Is that a lucky charm?  Raidou showed Shizu the lucky charm. Did you find that in the same place? ...I'm sorry, but... would you mind letting me hold on to that?  Raidou gave Shizu the lucky charm. ...Thank you. Thank you for helping my brother before. He really is just like a child in an adult's body. I need to work to pay off the hospital bills for my husband and brother. I'll do it! Come to think of it, Kiyoshi knows someone in the military brass. My brother bragged about him being a regular customer. Kiyoshi's invited a high-ranking military officer to the Daidouji Residence before, too... Come to think of it, Kiyoshi is acquainted with Major General Munakata. My brother was proud to have carried such a famous person. ...Ouran's uniforms are so lovely. I wish I could've worn one, at least once... Well, it was impossible from the start, with my brother's low earnings and my lack of smarts. My brother's a proud person. He never complains in front of me. But, if I had been more considerate and listened to him... If I'd helped shoulder his concerns, he wouldn't have turned out like that... My brother says that his back hurts sometimes, with sweat dripping down his face. He gripes about how he can't beat old age. Mr. Narumi left a note...? ...He said for you to wait, right? Then you should do as he says. It's encouraging to have someone to come back to. Mr. Narumi will be okay, as long as you're here. Sometimes... I get jealous of the trusting relationship men have, like my brother and Mr. Kiyoshi. Everything will be fine; Mr. Narumi has you to back him up. My brother went through that to power the monster at Harumi- Cho...? That's unforgivable, using my brother's passion for rickshaws to make that monster! Suffering is a sign that you're trying to live earnestly, right? It's unforgivable to use such people to make a monster, no matter what it's for! I'm almost done paying off my husband's hospital bill. My brother's recovering fast, too. On my last visit, he was eating solid foods. ...Ever since I met you,  everything's been going right. Thank you so much. I'll keep at it! I know it's not fair of me to ask you this, but I'm getting desperate. Please look for Shizu! Find my little sister! She's innocent, like a child and a man has tricked her! Please look for Shizu! Find my little sister! Shizu told you that!? ...I'm embarassed to say it, but once she decides something, she sticks to it. I beg you, please catch him! Catch the guy who attacked that taxi! See that little girl on the bridge? When Shizu was that age, she used to follow me wherever I went... And now she's dating that dang taxi driver! ...The Soulless God stopped, so it's a happy ending for everyone, right? Why are you still trying to chase down that girl? Narumi asked me to.There's a difference between dark and light, but we Summoners have the same destiny... The boss is always right, huh? I feel for you, Raidou. ...Your words have touched my cold, cybernetic heart. I've been in this business for a while, but... an idea like that never crossed my mind. You win, comrade. I submit to your earnest sensibility. ...Don't be fooled by looks. If you knew what was inside her... Would you still be singing that tune? Ever since starting here, I've been losing weight. Taking so many baths every day is hard work! My old friends from high school would be in for a surprise if they could see me now. I wonder what kinda guy my next customer will be. It makes me nervous, not knowing what's next. They get to select which one of us they want, but we have no such privilege... I don't bother getting dressed on my days off. All I do is sleep all day anyways. ...What are you looking at me like that for? A foreign customer? That's rare. I wonder how a foreign man... Oh, my! I must be overworked. When that man says heart, I think he's confused Japan's traditions with its red-light districts... Oh well, I'm sure he learned plenty anyway. Stuff they don't teach you at school, y'know? Lotta military guys come here on their break. The only big thing about them is their egos! They're not exactly welcome here. Nuh-uh.  Not the face. You can take a photo of anything else, just not the face. This job's harder than it looks, both physically and mentally. But hey, it's a living. I don't even know what else I could do anyway. Now that the red guards and Red Cape are more scarce, we just keep getting more customers. I've been so busy, I keep losing weight. I've been pitching myself as the plump type here, but I'm so active that I've slimmed down. Maybe I should start billing myself as slender. Men like slender women, right? My plumpness was my selling point, but now I'm skewing slender. Check out this hourglass figure! My friends say I look great, but I've gotten fewer calls. I was so happy about losing weight, but then I stopped getting any calls... It caused me so much stress I pigged out, and once I was plump again, business increased! Just proves that you should always sell what you know. Waden One? In Sakuradayama? Ahh... So that radio tower has a name. When I'm walking home from work and I see that, I can't help but... well... I ran away from Tsukudo-Cho to come here. See, my gambling debts were getting pretty steep... I'm sure my old friends would be shocked to learn how I make my living now. Working to repay my debt... I like to concentrate on moving forward. It's better than pretending my foolish past never existed. Thanks to that monster, our flow of customers dried up. I don't blame them, though. I know it sounds weird for me to say, but I'd look down on anyone who came to the Red-Light District now. Thanks to that monster, our flow of customers dried up. I don't blame them, though. It's just, this gloomy atmosphere doesn't fit the Red-Light District. There's something I can do, right? I mean, I'm still alive. I want to make all the men in the Capital happy. After all, it's a woman's job to get a man back on his feet! Hmmm... You're still a student, and they let you into the Red-Light District? So did you win Satake's favor or what, kid? Fast is good in this world. Working fast, moving fast... Time goes by fast when I'm with a geisha. ...That's not so good. The key to health is to not let my worries get all pent up. If I'm feeling stressed, I go to the Red-Light District! All my worries wash away with the bath water! I was curious, so I tried sleeping with a foreign woman once. ...Turns out being able to communicate is pretty important. I couldn't tell if she liked it or not. That foreigner wanted to see the heart of Japan. So, I had that geisha over there show him the ropes. It's a kind of international relations. You know, cultural exchange. That foreigner wanted to see the heart of Japan. So, I had that geisha over there show him the ropes. It's a kind of international relations. You know, cultural exchange. That foreign college student is here almost every day now. He's hooked. Not that I really blame him, though. The women working here all come from complex circumstances. It's not polite to ask them about it. Being a geisha is a tried-and-true job. They suppress their feelings to entertain their customers. That's much more respectable than building some crazy military ship. You know what the saddest thing is? Not being true to yourself. Seeing a woman and being hit right in the heart proves you're healthy. It's nothing to be ashamed of. Men are all just babies at heart. In the end, we just want to cuddle up against a woman's soft skin. So, scrawny women are no good. You can't get comfortable on bony ribs. Men are greedy. They want the right girl for the right circumstance. For walking around, they want looks. For sleeping with, they go by feel. And that's the truth. A young whippersnapper like you wouldn't understand, but lately my little guy isn't doing well. I feel like my manhood is slowly dying. It's not like I wasn't prepared for this, but... Waden One? Ahh, the radio tower at Sakuradayama. My little guy's not doing well lately; maybe that could help me. The burden of the past you've been shouldering will follow you around all your life. There's no putting it down. But, it's easy to forget about the weight of that burden if you have someone to help you do so. You may be able to forget the weight of your burden for a brief moment... But, it'll follow you around your entire life. The only one who can deal with it is you. I'm not saying don't fight. I'm saying, if you're gonna fight, don't use weapons. If you're not involved, then there's nothing to stop you from doing sickening things without thinking. We could see it from here. Not too well, but we saw smoke... The reason they can do such despicable things is because they're depending on machines. If there's no blood on one's hands, he can be as cruel as he wants. I've made up my mind: I'm retiring as of today. It's not because of my age, though. I was thinking of leaving these times for the young to carry on their shoulders. I'm looking forward to what you'll do in a couple of years, boy. Become a new Red-Light Legend!  The frequent customer's thoughts can be heard... ...He looks like he's calm, but every inch of him is on guard. Satake didn't approve him for nothing.... He's good! I... I come to study Japan of heart. Tradition Japanese very interesting! Yes! Hee hee... Bubbles! So spinny! Spinny spinny... I-I'm back to study Japanese heart again today! I got hooked on heart-shaped assets of the geisha... That geisha-san said something interesting to me... ...I think I caught a small glimpse of the Japanese language's elegance. Being with geisha-san reminds me of being nursed in a hospital... ...Never mind. I want tell joke but it wasn't appropriate. I came to Red-Light District to formulate my thesis. ...Which I cannot tell. If someone stole my idea, I would be starting over from scratching. My next paper will draw from personal experience... ...you know, of the personal kind. I see that old man is talking about right place, right time. ...That's a good topic for my next thesis. Some Japanese men refer to their troopers as little guy. ...I can definitely understand why that old man is in mourning. Some Japanese men refer to their troopers as little guy. As you can see, these surroundings are helping me learn Japanese. That geisha-san has been through a lot... She compared her life to some Naniwa-bushi person. Hmm... Happiness will not walk toward you. That is why we must walk toward it, so much. One day, one step... Three days, three more... You take three steps forward and five steps back... ...wait, no. My things are at Harumi-Cho. I came on a regularly scheduled ship, but... Monster's weapon is like a hurricane. Even a non-direct hit would still damage the surroundings. With the monster gone, I can return home to my country. I enjoyed experiencing the uh... heart of Japan. Of all the memories I take home, that will be my favorite.  The foreign exchange student's thoughts can be heard... My professor said I could find the heart of Japan in Senju-Ku. ...So, this must be the feeling of a traditional Japanese town. How wonderful! Incredible! The ladies of the Capital have mastered so many different techniques! I'm leaning so much studying the heart of Japan! ...Yeah, I'm hooked. Nothing but geisha are spinning around in my head. The heart of Japan is unique. It crosses all international boundaries! The face is off limits, but she's okay with the body? ...Aha! This explains the Japanese proverb, Hide the head but not the ass! Geisha heal their customers. They're like self-sacrificing nurses. They're not angels in white, but angels in kimonos! Ahahaha! You can tell the strength of a nation's economy by looking at bustling towns. The subject of my thesis is The Economy of the Capital as seen from the Red-Light District. Girls who say they have a cute friend are lying. The friend they bring along is never even nice. My next paper will go in-depth on the psychology of females in regards to the circumstances of friendship. Right place, right time. Case by case. A supply for every demand, huh? My thesis this time is on the type of woman appropriate for different occasions. I'm sure it must be hard as a parent when your son has fallen ill. No matter what the country, a parent's love for his little one is the same! ...It makes me a little homesick. I've heard about science using electromagnetism in medical procedures, but... The Capital is using radio waves. Japanese medical science is light years beyond our own! I know Naniwa-bushi is like a ballad of the mundane, but... Wasn't Naniwa from Osaka? So what would that make this? ...Maybe a geisha-bushi? A bushy geisha? Hmm... So wait, three steps forward and five back would mean... I'd be two steps behind. ...Meaning happiness is waiting for us to turn around. The Japanese language has such depth... ...The scheduled cruise should be about ready to come in, right? Hopefully it doesn't run into the monster of Harumi-Cho. At least the monster is some distance from Harumi-Cho, I hear. But, a tornado as big as that... What's its radius of effect like? I called a geisha Mommy. Just like the Japanese idiom, it felt like fire was coming out of my face... The Red-Light District is a great place for studying life. I should tell my friends back home. That man is... ohhh copacetic. I've never felt like that before. He's the cat's pajamas and I want to be the cat with him all over my body. You're lookin' for Shizu? Oh, that's too bad. She quit... No one has a clue why. She wasn't one to flap her gums. You're lookin' for Shizu? Oh, that's too bad. She's booked solid today. I don't think she can come out now. She's gotten real popular lately. Girl took all my regulars, too. Wearing a cloak when the Red Cape's all over the papers... Well, I'm not accusing ya of anything. It's just... Y'know? ...Calm down, I gotta cool it. Looks like I react every time I see that cape of yours. H-Hey, can ya take off that ca... Er, well, I don't mean ta criticize your taste, but... ...Looking at your cloak, it reminds me of when I was a kid. Er... Never mind. It's nothing special. I've never seen ya take off that hat of yours. I hear ya even  wear it in the bathroom. Well, I'm sure you have your reasons.  I don't mean to  criticize ya. I wanted to tell ya this earlier, but... That cloak of yours is just screaming, I'm hiding something dangerous! Though, I'm in a similar profession. Ain't my place to criticize ya. That thing stickin' out of your cloak is a sheath, huh? That ain't real, is it? I'm not criticizin' ya, but I don't want fights breaking out smack dab in the middle of town. I been meaning to ask ya...  Ya been going to school? I flunked a grade by missin' too many classes, so I can't really criticize ya... A Yumizuki student and an Ouran schoolgirl, huh? This is the birth of a big romance! Don't forget ta invite me to your wedding. Good thing for you that you've got a dame in tow. You'll know what I mean if you go to the science lab, but don't say I didn't warn you... Good thing for you that you've got a dame in tow. Been to the science lab, eh? Then you know exactly what I mean. ...Looks like something's eatin' ya. Times like those, go take a bath. You'll feel refreshed. ...You all right? You gotta cold or somethin'? Don't go to the baths, then. It's no good when drying off makes you all cold.  The Haguro-gumi punk's thoughts can be heard... I thought this guy was the Red Cape at first. I mean, he's got a cape on. But... As long as he doesn't start anything, I guess it's okay. When you look close, he's not that different-looking from those Special Guards. When I was a kid these were popular... Student cloaks, they called 'em. I begged Ma to buy me one and she did. But, I was too short, so it was always dragging. Ya can't get through there; Special Guards in red capes have blocked it. Careful you don't make eye contact with them. They don't let up, even on honest citizens. If you're gonna go, you better be ready. Finish whatever's on your plate first. The Special Guard left. And all without saying a word to us. But, at least now honest people can walk the streets without worrying about a shakedown. The doodad on those red-caped Special Guard was the Army insignia! All that equipment just for sealing this little city... What the hell are they doing with taxpayer money? Still, those red-caped Special Guards were creepy... It's like there was no blood running in their veins. What's the Army's criteria for employment, anyway? I saw something fly outta the factory way over there. It looked like a red lump... Was it a balloon or something? In Harumi-Cho, people revere the Navy base. They're leaps and bounds more popular than the Army, but either way, I don't like the military. Looks like there's a buncha things going down at Harumi-Cho. It's by the naval headquarters, but that doesn't do any good if security's full of holes. The military facilities at Akasaka-ku are costing way too much money. The top brass just uses them for meetings. What a waste of the taxpayers' money... There's stuff goin' down at Kasumidai now, too. It's right in the Army's backyard, but that doesn't do any good if the security's full of holes. Think it's okay to trust a deserter that much? There's somethin' suspicious about that guy. I doubt he just turned over a new leaf, y'know? I haven't seen the red-caped Special Guard for a while. The Red Cape seems to be making himself scarce, too. Those red-caped Special Guards are under direct orders from Munakata, I hear. I wouldn't even want to sit at the same table as those freaks. The red-caped Special Guard didn't even touch the science laboratory. ...In a way, you'd assume they would hit that place harder than anywhere else. Boss tells us all the time not to cause trouble. Laying a hand on law-abiding citizens is just plain outta the question. The men of the Kantou Haguro-gumi look scary, but they're all nice people. They just retrieved some money that was stolen from me. I don't like those Special Guard guys. They don't even smile or say hello. Oh! It's Mr. Iida! Is he off work today, too? Mr. Iida is taking a break from work again today. That means he can play with me again! Yay! Mr. Iida's gone today. I wonder if he went to work. Mr. Iida's late. I wonder where he went. Where's Mr. Iida? He promised he'd play with me today. He lied to me... The ocean has more water than this river, right? I wonder if it has lots of fishies. It'd be fun to play there with all my friends. Mama told me there are shoals of shrimp, ships and seagulls at the seaside. She had trouble telling me, though... Won't anyone play with me...? I wonder if the man at the vacant lot in back wants to play...  The pure and innocent girl's spirit was rekindled. Liar, liar, pants on fire! Come back, Mr. Iida! It's no fun playing by myself! This town's alleyways are rather complicated. Even us locals get lost. ...By the way, sonny, do you know the way to my house? It's already been 20 years since my old lady died. Sometimes, I long to hold a woman in my arms again. ...Hey, sonny, have you seen my old lady around? I saw Shizu hanging around the Red-Light District. Naturally, I told Denpachi about it. Then, he called me a senile old man! I heard that textile factory over there is the property of some rich family at Yarai-Ku. ...By the way, sonny, do you know the way to Senju-Ku? The porridge I just had was too salty. I felt like I was drinking salt water. ...By the way, sonny, is dinner ready yet? There are records of all the foreigners who come to the Capital. Records are great, because they're never wrong! You just can't trust memory like you can a piece of paper. Sometimes there are things a man's gotta do, even if it's  dangerous. ...By the way, sonny, do you know what I was supposed to be doing? You may not believe it, but I used to be in the military. I was a highly skilled intelligence operative. ...Hmm, let's see now... Was I in the Army? Or was it the Navy? You may not think so, but I used to be in the military. Even now, I still remember the midday signal. ...Hmm, let's see now... What was that sound? A cannon? A bugle? ...A conch shell, that was it. What's that?  Goods, you say? Whaddaya mean, good riddance!? I'm still alive and kicking. I'm not senile, sonny! Huh? You're looking for a shiny object? ...Who you calling bald, ya whippersnapper! I've still got my hair! Can't you see the top of my head? What was that, sonny? Science...? Ahh, the science laboratory. Yep, that was my nickname when I was in elementary school. Now, how'd you know that? What!? Worse!? H-How rude! I'm getting better and better every day. I'll have you know I'm older than I loo... Huh? Curse? Radio tower? Radio waves come out of a tower? You can see radio waves? Sonny, I wish I had eyesight as keen as yours. You may not think so, but I used to be in the military. I was a highly skilled intelligence agent. ...But, those days were hard. I've tried so many times to forget them, but even today... I completely forgot about them. I was testing a combustion engine. What do they call them nowadays...? Somethin-ket? The science laboratory is bustling right now. They're going to launch something! ...Hm? What were they going to  launch...? My memory's lost in space... The science laboratory is bustling right now. They're going to launch something! What was it? A racket? No... A locket...? Some huge thing flew out from the science laboratory... It was incredible! My senility just went right down the drain. I feel young again! When I grow up, I wanna be like Satake. If I take a bath every day, will I become like him? A man's not supposed to cry, even if he's sad, he said. And, he said I have to become stronger. Satake is from the Kansai region. Even so, he's an important man in the Kantou Haguro-gumi, huh? I wanna be just like Satake when I grow up... I'm gonna become strong! I wanna be like Satake when I grow up. I'm gonna have a drawing on my back, like him. But, Dad got angry at me when I said that. Why? When I grow up, I'm gonna be just like Satake. I want to have my own base, kinda like how Satake has the Daikoku-Yu. I'm gonna be like Satake when I get bigger, and have my own base like his bathhouse. I just found a great place for my own base! When I grow up, I'm gonna be like Satake. I hafta go find lackeys just like his! I wonder if the girl on the bridge will be one of my lackeys... ...Dad hit me, yelling, Where have you been!? But now, he's smiling. ...He's so weird.  The wannabe kid's spirit was rekindled. Work work work! That's all Dad talks about! Is work so important!? How could it be more important than me!? Well, I don't need Dad! I'm plenty strong! I got a lackey, but I still don't have a good base! I'm not gonna give up until I find a base, just like Satake's public bathhouse. I'm gonna be a strongman like Satake! There's an unwritten rule in Fukagawa: don't investigate other people's pasts just for fun. I don't want to tell you how to do your job, but it's something you should remember. To work at the Red-Light District, you need to be prepared. You'll be handling a lot of business every day. It's hard physical labor, just as advertised. ...Since he's not here, I can tell you that Mr. Iida's concern for Shizu is just his ego speaking. She didn't fall in love with a taxi driver, she fell in love with a man. He just happens to drive a taxi. If you trip and fall, you have to get right back up. Everyone falls in life. The cuts and scars on your legs are like visible memories. People who come from overseas eventually go back there. They never give a second thought to those they leave behind... Keepsakes can be cruel. Whenever you see them, the things you've forgotten about come roaring right back. It'd be so easy if you could just throw them away. But, I don't want to forget the good times... I worked at a munitions factory for a short time. There was a magazine there... Never mind. It makes me sick even to think of it. Some people become successful by feeding off war. Running guns and raking in the cash... it makes me sick even to think of it. If a young woman doesn't want to go back home, she must be trying to avoid her parents, right? You shouldn't get involved. You wouldn't want to be dragged into it, would you? If a young woman decides to cut her hair... It's probably unrequited love, don't you think? A girl's really down right after a heartbreak, so if you comfort her now, she'll fall for you in a snap. That Doctor Tsukumo at the science laboratory... Seeing him reminds me of an old lover. Why are all men so... ...Some people are like lizard's tails. They can always be replaced by a new one, so they're desperate to keep from being cast off. A wanderer like me only settled down here because this is where Satake lives. ...We live in the same city, and yet he seems so far out of reach, y'know...? I was so naive to wait each day, believing in some scribbled note asking me to wait for him. If I knew it would turn out like that, I would've chased after him... You're probably too young to have seen a loved one die right before your eyes. It's hard to stop thinking about how helpless you are. What could I have done to stop it...? you think. It sounds tough to say, Go for broke, but it's really the coward's way out. Those who stand their ground till the end have it ten times harder. It's quite a gamble, getting a rocket to hit a satellite up there. Nothing for us normal people to do but relax and leave luck to the heavens. The gamble paid off, didn't it? I saw your rocket go up. That means everything will work out. Luck is on your side.  The woman with a past's thoughts can be heard... Love is blind, but I wish I'd been able to see that foreigner for what he was... He's probably living it up with his fiancee over there. It's so wishy-washy of me to keep a picture of a him. Why can't I forget him, even when I know he's living the good life at home with his lover...? That kid with the mutilated limb in the magazine... He wouldn't forgive us if we got on our knees and begged. I'm as guilty as the rest of them for helping to make those horrible things. Those bombs... Maybe I've never met 'em, but that doesn't mean I can't hate them. They get so rich off of suffering, they can afford to use bank notes for kindling. I once took pity on a man who'd been disowned by his parents, and he repaid me by running off with my money. Not that I was so innocent in that matter, hoping for a payoff from his doctor parents... Once, a man who comforted my broken heart only succeeded in breaking it again later... My heart's been broken so many times now, it's held together with glue and twine. The man I remember would tell the women he dated about his secret dream of being an actor. Not even a beautiful girl can sway a man once he's got his mind fixed on a goal. This boy reminds me of myself so many years ago. Love doesn't excuse the length of time I spent being that man's mistress, and all for nothing... I'll just have to content myself watching the great man from afar. A woman with a past as checkered as mine would never have a chance with Satake, anyway... I thought I had prepared myself for the possibility that a soldier would have to give his life, but... In the end, I couldn't let go of him... and I'll always keep the note he left me. I was only deluding myself if I thought I could handle it. There's a project underway to level the Daidouji Factory and turn it into a parking lot. But, we're having a hard time. Mr. Daidouji is being stubborn about the whole thing.  The scrutinizing man's thoughts can be heard... Does he seriously believe that his losses can be magically turned into profits? Just because his brother helped him start the company doesn't mean it'll last forever. I pity any worker who has to deal with that good-for-nothing Kiyoshi. You seen my boy? About 10 years old, buzz cut, looks a little like me. The empty lot around back? Thanks, kid, I'll check it out. Last I heard, he was going to play in the empty lot around back. Where'd he get to this time? ...I-I'm not worried about him! I just don't like not knowing where he is. You seen my boy? About 10 years old, buzz cut, looks a little like me. He went out to play and hasn't come back... He's never done this before. You seen my boy? About 10 years old, buzz cut, looks a little like me. He went out to play and hasn't come back.... I have no idea where he could be. You seen my boy? About 10 years old, buzz cut, looks a little like me. I don't know where he gets all this energy. He must take after his mother... There was a boy here, right? A kid about 10 years old, with a buzz cut? I've searched everywhere else. I don't know where to look now. There was a kid here, right? That's my boy. Where'd he go? I don't think he could have left Senju-Ku... The kid who used to play here is my son, but... He left without telling me what he was up to. I'm getting frantic here, trying to find him. What the hell was that!? Some fiery ball just flew up into the air! M-My boy... My boy's all right, isn't he...? H-Hey! I heard Koutou-Ku's in danger! You don't think...? My boy couldn't have made it all the way there on his own, could he? My boy seems like he's grown since the last time I saw him. Maybe I'm just so happy to see him, but he looks at least three inches taller.  The working man's thoughts can be heard... I wasn't able to play with him much because I was so busy at work. I thought maybe we could play catch on the days I get off early, but... He almost never leaves our neighborhood. Where could he be? I hope he's not starving out there. He's a growing boy, and he needs a lot to eat. That boy's a real live wire. Once he's out the door, there's no stopping him. I hope he knows better than to talk to strangers... This is worse than a treasure hunt. I don't even know where to start. Just like me, he does things without thinking, so I hope he doesn't take any wooden nickels. I thought maybe he went to the Daidouji factory, but there was nobody there but some old man. Where the hell could have have gone!? He rode a train once, but... I didn't think I gave him enough change to take the train to another district... Did I? I keep telling him to write down where he's going. Looks like he's as forgetful as I am. H-He's all right, isn't he? Please, let him be all right! This is just my luck! My boy's not at Koutou-Ku, is he? He's reckless enough to go there... He takes after me that way. I'm so proud of my boy! I better not tell him, though. He could get the wrong idea. I don't want him to think running away without telling anyone is a good idea. I may look like a man, but I'm a girl at heart. Unfortunately, boys like you just aren't my type. I prefer a man with a thick beard. I may look like a man, but I'm a girl at heart. Unfortunately, boys like you just aren't my type. I prefer a man with a big Adam's apple. I may look like a man, but I'm a girl at heart. That's just the way I am. It's not easy to look this way if you don't have the guts for it. A maiden's path is a thorny one. What is it, hon? Do you want to play with big sis? I dunno, you look awfully tired. You wouldn't last one round with me like that. What is it, hon? Do you want to play with big sis? I dunno, you look awfully tired. You wouldn't last one round with me like that. I may look like a man, but I'm a girl at heart. You've got a nice, pretty face on you. But, fierce-looking faces like Satake's are more my type. I may look like a man, but I'm a girl at heart. You're a nice- looking young man. But, I prefer men who look good in suits. When you've got your heart set on someone, you don't care about their looks, do you? I go for guys who think of nothing but me. How about it, kid? ...Just kidding. I can outmuscle any guy, but deep down, I get scared like any other girl... I'm terrified of those Special Guards. Y-You mean they're back...!? I may look like a man, but I'm a girl at heart. You seem like a nice guy, but you're not my type. Now you, on the other hand... You doing anything this weekend, kitty? I've been thinking about the difference between my muscular body and girlish spirit. I think having both manly and womanly aspects is why I worry about love twice as much as usual.  The muscular woman's eyes are glued onto Raidou... Wow... That silky skin of yours is so lovely and soft! I know it's not traditional for the woman to ask the man, but please, won't you marry me? Gosh... The way your neck is hidden under your cloak is so captivating! I've got an idea... Let's wear matching outfits and take a stroll through Ginza. Whaddaya say? Please, call me big sis! That's strange, I've suddenly got the urge to nurse you back to health. Looks like my girlish instincts are winning out over my manly exterior for once. I love men with the kind of life experience that Satake's earned. But, there's also something to be said for younger guys like you. It's so hard to decide! A gentleman in a suit is swell... But, maybe I've been overlooking the appeal of a school uniform. It's so hard to decide! All of a sudden, cute young guys like you are all I can think about! Can I follow you home...? They say your heartbeat's the same when you're afraid and when you're in love... Is this thumping in my chest fear of the Special Guards? Or could it be... I've fallen for you? You're a cat lover, aren't you? Mrroww... I'd like to curl up alongside you some night. I'll be the most obedient cat you've ever seen... Come on! Are you going to stand around all day or are we going to get to it? You just have to ask, and I can be your sis or your bro, know what I mean? If I had to lay odds on a fight between you and the Boss... You seem pretty strong, but... I'd hafta go with the Boss. That stiff tried to yell at us about some kinda martial law, so Boss showed him what's what. If he'd just have left, this wouldn'ta happened. May he rest in peace. Why don't you take a look in the mirror before speaking up? A boy like you needs to know his place. If you're gonna complain, at least show some respect. What you're doing shames that emblem on your hat. I-I don't remember... going easy on... them... Haha... But, those Spe...cial Guards... in red got me... Dammit... Don't they know... how to let up...? Man... One of 'em came right up out of nowhere and roundhoused me right in the breadbasket... Aah... It's just that those red Special Guards came, but Boss showed them. Harumi-Cho is in trouble, right? I heard from that Army soldier there. I guess if you think about it, we're all in trouble. This is the time for us to hold together and dig in. What the hell are those Army guys trynna do with those ships and radio towers? I can't get my head around it. It sure slays me to watch them, though. He's so eager to pick a fight and that's the best he can do? Well, he gets what he deserves. I guess they don't teach you how to size up your enemy in military school. Is he calling our leader, Fukagawa- cho's #1 defender of chivalry, a punk!? I guess they don't teach you how to mind your manners in military school. Pa...thetic... huh? I couldn't even... get a... single hit in... But... they're... more pathetic... The Army... fighting amongst.. themselves... How can you understand outsiders if you don't even understand your own kind, y'know? The military says it's fighting for the country, but they're really only thinking about themselves. Now's not the time to say I told you so about the military, or the police, or the yakuza. If they need me, I plan to help out at Harumi-Cho just like anyone else. D-Don't think you'll get away with this! I'm reporting this! Y-You'll all get the firing squ--er, life sentence! Ha... Haha... Hahahahaha! You punks! Now I'm going to get my revenge for what you did! H-How dare that Zero Division unit step on a fellow soldier's face...  I-I'm going to report this! He's facing a court-martial! That Zero Division Special Guard wasn't stationed in Senju... I-Is he acting outside of his jurisdiction!? That sort of insubordination can lower morale! I must report this to Major General Munakata! I don't have time to be playing around with punks! I-I need to get to Harumi-Cho! I don't care if they court-martial me! S-Saving human lives comes first! It was scary being with Boss... But, it was fun, too! I hope he'll take me with him next time he goes looking for a base...  The pure and innocent girl's spirit was rekindled. I've made up my mind! I'm gonna marry Boss! Then we'll always be together, right? I can go look for a base with him, right? Mr. Iida is showing his age... Whoops. It's unladylike to let things like that slip. Shizu used to be so attached to her brother... Whoops. It's unladylike to let things like that slip. No matter how much Mr. Iida complains, he'd do anything for her... Whoops. It's unladylike to let things like that slip. Shizu really does have it tough. The poor thing's boyfriend... Whoops. It's unladylike to let things like that slip. Shizu shouldn't shut her brother out like that... Whoops. It's unladylike to let things like that slip.  The obliging young lady's thoughts can be heard... Mr. Iida looks tired lately. Shizu leaving must have crushed his spirit... Shizu is such a good-natured and considerate girl. Whenever she buys groceries, she always keeps her brother's work in mind. She'll make a great wife for someone. I envy her boyfriend. Shizu's boyfriend got into an accident. Ginza-Cho, was it? That place is so poorly lit... there was bound to be an accident eventually. Shizu's a lot stronger-willed than she looks. Those two were so close. I hope everything goes back to normal soon. Nooo! Denpachi! Your back looks so lonely without a cart! Nooo! Denpachi! This is awful! His skills are just going to waste! Nooo! Denpachi! I sympathize with you, brother! If I had a little sister like that, I'd have belted her one! Denpachi! C'mon, Denpachi! Come back out and show us all how it's done! Us rickshaw runners still have so much to learn from you...  The shirtless man calmed down. I mean, it used to be just the two of 'em, and now he's all alone. Just watching him from behind puts a tear in my eye now. Denpachi's rickshaw handling is the best, bar none. Now that automobiles are getting popular, though, it's harder than it used to be to make a living. A cart puller's flesh and blood, saying she wants to marry a taxi driver? You don't have to be Denpachi to lose your head over that. Rickshaws are heavy already, and just try running with one when it's got a passenger inside. Denpachi's pretty fast just running on his own! I'm a worker at that lousy... Er, President Kiyoshi's factory. Well, a former worker, I should say. The job was tough, but break time wasn't so bad. Me and the other guys would play mahjong as we relaxed to the scent of incense. We left everything there, including the incense. I wonder if it's still lying around... Y'know... I can't help it, but in the bath, my eyes always end up straying to... you know. Sheesh, first I get walloped in a fight, and now this... Seems like the world is out to embarrass me. You wouldn't know to look at me, but I'm no good in bed. I prefer leaving it to the girl. I just lie back, gaze at the ceiling... It's heaven. Meeting someone at Ginza- Cho? They tell me that's a hot dating spot these days. You're going for it with that reporter, aren't you? I want to hear the juicy details later, m'kay? That reporter gave you a little gift, did she? Damn... Looks like you've got yourself a sugar daddy. Or sugar mommy, in this case. Gloomy women are pretty easy, but, you know... I'd rather lie next to a woman with a smile on her face. Don't you think so? Off to Daidouji's factory next? You never sit still, do you? Well, you'll be fine. It's not obvious from looking at you, but... you're something else, kid. The bathhouse is fine, but there's nothing like feeling that ocean breeze down at the beach. Naked, of course. It'd make the Buddha tattoo on my back happy, too. A foreign dame stopped me at Harumi-Cho a while back. Turns out, she was an unlicensed streetwalker. I said no thanks and kept walkin'. You gotta be polite, even to dames like that. Every man has a woman he'd probably like to forget. I'm sure Elfman was friendly with the ladies in his time, too. Paintin' the town red with that reporter chick, are ya? Nice. Where ya off to? ...Kasumidai? What are you going to a dull burg like that for? Want me to pose for a photo? I'm all for it, but... You're not a plainclothesman, are you? The reporter chick fainted!? You're incredible! Are you really just a student? What other tricks do you have up those sleeves? I hear tell you carried a schoolgirl with long hair around Tsukudo-Cho, izzat right? A reporter and a schoolgirl... You're one kid who's not wasting his youth. Izzat short-haired girl outside your... you know? Didn't the one you were carrying around have long hair? So wait, you sweet-talked TWO Ouran girls? You're a machine, kid. I have a lotta respect for that professor. He's picks up on things that you and I can't. He can guess the color of a passing girl's underwear, with a 70% rate of accuracy. He does it by analyzing their looks and gestures. It's all very scientific. It's a great thing to die for the one you love. Myself, I love the Boss. I'd put my life on the line for him, no two ways about it. That expression Boss gets when things get serious... That's the face I fell in love with. ...When I say love, I mean... D-Don't get the wrong idea, kid. Boss never uses his fists. He keeps his arms folded under his kimono at all times. Most punks surrender after one kick from him. There's no need for him to get his hands dirty. People try, but to this day, he's never been defeated in battle. He's a monster. Boss used his fists!? Those Special Guards in red must be unbeatable! ...Though, Boss beat 'em, so I guess he's still the bigger monster. You're going to space in a rocket? You can do something like that? Well, don't that beat all. Bring me back a souvenir, will ya? They say Fukagawa-Cho is dangerous 'cause of people like us. But, right now, Fukagawa-Cho might be the safest place in all the Capital. Special Guards, battleships... Boss can handle anything. You got potential, kid. Boss remembered your name, right? I shined his shoes for three years before he started to remember mine. Shizu's a looker, and her work record is flawless, but.. It seems like her heart's not in it. Guys say it's like she's not even there. Once in a while, Shizu comes to check out the house. She's probably worried about her brother. They're on the outs right now, but they're still brother and sister. That's a bond that can't be broken. Shizu quit and skipped town. She didn't tell us where she was going. After what happened with her brother... We'll probably never see her again. After her boyfriend checks outta the hospital, Shizu's gonna see Denpachi and set things right. Shizu's never looked prettier. It's like the demons bothering her just upped and left. A young copper came around to ask about the factory. One look at us and he turned tail shouting, Please don't kill me! Rude, ain't he? Wherever there's people, there's trouble. Plenty of people are willing to break the law to protect what's theirs. Say now, that's some jewel you got there. If we had one of those, we could rebuild Daikoku-Yu. A soldier's life is pretty strict, I hear. They probably don't have time to take nice long baths. Good thing I'm not in the military. A soldier's life is dictated by the sound of the cannon, I hear. BOOM! And it's lunchtime. ...Sounds more like a dog's life to me. Isn't that warship the military is building against some kinda treaty? If the Western powers find out, we could have a second world war on our hands. There was a ruckus at Cannon Battery #4. The Army guys acted calm, but... They're fooling with an abandoned ship underground. If word got out, the civilians wouldn't be too happy. The ruckus at Cannon Battery #4 was covered up before it hit the presses. Munakata personally leaned on the the papers so's they'd clam up. The science laboratory...? Oh, that. You mean the shack by the riverbed. That guy came to pay homage to the Boss before, so he's all right in our book. Don't overdo it, okay? Sometimes a group won't stay together unless one guy emerges as the Boss. Order is important, but you can't overdo it. It's a fragile balance of trust between you and them. Boss is already outta here. You didn't see him outside? Since you're already here, you oughtta go pay your respects. I heard a big commotion coming from outside... It was probably just the Boss. There's plenty of saps who think they can make a name for themselves by beating him. I heard a big commotion coming from outside... That definitely sounded like the Boss. Lots of punks try to make their bones by beating him. That's the price of being famous. So, that's what happened out there. Is he okay? No, not Boss, the Special Guard. Boss doesn't know how to ease up on a guy. You can really learn something by watching that guy Tsukumo. The final result isn't as important as the effort you put in to get there. Boss'll protect this town. And we'll protect the Daikoku-Yu for the Boss. The whole world's about give and take. There's only so much a man can do on his lonesome, no matter how hard he tries. Dummy message. Wh-What are we doing here, Raidou!? You want to take a bath THAT much? It can't wait? Huh? You want to take a bath before the interview? Well... all right. I'll be outside. No, I'm not going in there with you! What are you thinking!? Speaking of the Red-Light District, that reminds me of a story... May I? Let's hear it.There was a man who screamed at one of his employees every day out of spite. The man became involved from afar with a prostitute, and began to spend his company's money on her. He gave her the most expensive gifts to win her over, but she always refused to meet him. Finally, the impatient man stormed into her room... Only to discover his put-upon employee. His constant stream of gifts ended supporting the very man he so despised. Very well. Here, each meeting is cherished, on the assumption there may not be a next time. It's much better than just living life out with the same lover, day in and day out. Just sitting around won't do anything. There's no pioneering  spirit or creativity in that. So, this year is... Taisho... 20, correct? Fukagawa-Cho hasn't changed much since the Edo days, so my sense of time gets... Anyway. Any pioneering spirit has been completely depleted from this town. Nothing new can arise by clinging so tightly to the past.  It's a Dragon Cave. Mysterious power is flowing out of it...  Here, Raidou can record his findings without being disturbed.  Save? Yes Recover health? Yes  and his demons were healed. *sob* *sob* ...Who are you? I've never seen you around here... I'm Nakisawame. I heal everyone... *sob* Welcome. *sob* Welcome. It's a full moon, so... Do you want me to heal you? Yes yen... Is that okay? YesThis may sting a little, but only for a moment...   and his demons were healed.   was healed. *sob* Don't die on me... Please... *sob* So... You're going to die, too... You don't have enough money... *sob* So... You'll die just like all the rest...  Leave the area? Yes It's an elevator.  It looks like humans are unable to reach inside and take the contents.  It's a glowing, red crystal.  The contents inside shift and warp. Take the contents? Yes  fished around for the contents... ......   obtained .  It's a glowing, blue crystal. Take the contents? Yes It's empty.  Raidou obtained .  Raidou obtained .   obtained .   obtained .  There's something on the ground. Pick it up?  Raidou obtained .   obtained .   found something. ......  Raidou obtained .   found something. ......  Raidou obtained .  The Shikimi no Kage has been destroyed. The way ahead is clear.  It's a Tainted Gate. A demon should be able to pass through.  Raidou paid  yen worth of streetcar fare and returned to the detective agency.  Raidou returned to the detective agency.  Raidou didn't have  yen for the streetcar fare.  Gouto covered the rest. ......  Raidou didn't have  yen for the streetcar fare.  The rest of the fare was paid out of Gouto's wallet.  Raidou used the  and returned to the detective agency. . It's about time you paid up for all the times I covered your streetcar fare.  Raidou paid Gouto back for all the times he borrowed money to pay his fare.  All the money Gouto lent to Raidou for the streetcar fare was returned to Gouto's wallet.  It's not that easy to escape from here!  There's still more to investigate.  The Mute ailment prevents the use of that ability.   felt it would be best if Raidou were here.   felt the urge to report back to Raidou.   wondered if Raidou should investigate here, too.  That cannot be used here.   began a solo investigation.   reported the findings of the investigation.   talked animatedly about the particulars of the investigation.   reported to Raidou despite its fatigue.   is eager to pick a fight.  The encounter rate went up.   played it hard to get.  The encounter rate went down.  The effects of Provoke wore off.  The effects of Intimidate wore off.  The effects of Repulse Water wore off.  The effects of the Attract Water wore off.  The effects of the Soda wore off.  The effects of the poison wore off.   tried using Ignite.   tried using Cool Down.   tried searching areas with spiritual energy.   scouted around the area.   returned from the scouting mission.  In this area...     ...were spotted lurking around.  ...no demons were spotted.  As for items left in the area...   have been confirmed.   told Raidou he'd have to to find any hidden items himself. ...none were spotted.   also found   while scouting.  Raidou obtained .   tried a good, hard strike.   tried using the art of mind reading.   filled the air with pheromones.   is spacing out.   looked at the human and was surprised.  It's no use!   is reminiscing about its home.  It seems humans are foreign to .   tried hard to make conversation.  Alas, it was invisible to the human.   hung back bashfully.  The human didn't notice.   winked!  The human didn't notice.   attempted intimidation!  But,  ended up as the one being intimidated.   tried singing a song.  Eventually, it got bored and stopped.   tried getting the first strike.  It was a futile effort.   asked for MAG.  Alas, it was invisible to the human.   asked for money.  Alas, it was invisible to the human.   was startled.  The human turned this way as  tried to make conversation.  ...Or so it seemed.

People going about their business... Every one of them doing the same thing like clockwork. All it would take is a little of the demonic in their lives... ...to give their world a little occult spice. I'm a private detective who specializes in that sort of case. The bright sun darkens, and the hazy sky becomes gray, signaling the bad news ahead. It's under that type of sky that I get work, investigating the certain catastrophe to come. . Hello...? Um, is this the Narumi Detective Agency? That's what I said. Are you the detective? I heard there's no caper you can't solve. Cute.  But, we only take the... special cases, if you catch my meaning. I... I have this problem. And, I don't really know what to do. I want to talk to you about it. Uh huh... So, um... Could you meet me at the  right away? Listen kid, I'm sure you're a nice bird, but I'm not in the mood for prank calls. Where are your parents? No, I mean it! I'm telling you straight! Please, sir! Please help! ...Hey! Hello...? You there, kid!? Wonder what that's about. ...She did say please. . , Raido. What do you make of all that business last night? I've heard a lot of weird rumors about that bridge. You know what they say, right? ...About people disappearing and then showing up outta nowhere? Think that could be what we witnessed back there? Still... a girl asking us to kill her? That's slightly disturbing. ...Not to mention the red soldier guys. Hey Raidou, think you can find out who that bird was? Maybe her name or something? It's bad business to have a client vanish right under our nose. We should at least look into it. ...This case does seem a bit out of the ordinary. Narumi's right. Let's investigate this further, . Being a detective is all about legwork. That is, your legwork, as you ask around town for information. I'd go, but it's easier for you to do it anyway. You know, with those demons of yours. Hey there, Raido. How's the investigation going?  Raido told Narumi about the girl's diary and ths overheard conversation. ...... So, a possessed dame held captive underground... you don't say. That stuff her uncle told her... And those guys you overheard... I dunno who that uncle character was talking to, but it sounded pretty interesting, don't you think? YesLooks like you're getting the hang of detective work, Raido.  that conversation, you might learn something. ...You just aren't getting it, are you Raido? Let me teach you something about detective work. Those two were talking about Kaya, right? Don't you think you might learn something if you  that conversation? Which means... use a demon to investigate further. ...Now, who could he be talking to? And, about what? Maybe you'll learn something about where Kaya's being held. I'm counting on you. Hey, Raidou. How's the investigation going?  Raidou told Narumi about the developments thus far. ...... So the bird thought she'd be possessed by a demon, and she's imprisoned underground somewhere. ...The head of the Daidouji family has taken ill, and well... We watched Kaya get abducted. So generally, I would say that her uncle, Kiyoshi, is suspicious. Let's say he wants to inherit his family's wealth... That still wouldn't explain everything. Kaya contacted us. Just as we were getting somewhere, she was abducted by those men. So... who were they? Where'd they take her? We also need to know who Kiyoshi was talking to. ...These aren't things we can figure out on our own. You'll have to go back to the Daidouji Residence. Have a chat with Kiyoshi. Find out who the other man was. Geez... Of course we'd get dragged into something crazy like this, Raidou. What started as a kidnapping is now an ancient family secret... and demons are involved. ...Not to mention the girl's uncle turning into a monster and charging off to God-knows-where. Did you ever stop to consider a normal life? Hm? You bring in the strangest cases. Seriously. ...But, the police could never handle demons. *sigh* What do you think we should do next? This is no ordinary caper, now that demons are involved. No matter what Narumi says, he knows you're the only one who can solve this and protect the Capital. ...That red-caped monster is our only lead right now. We have to track him down. But, we don't know where he skipped off to, do we? ...Let's rest for now. Kaya being abducted, and Kiyoshi turning into a monster... ...This is just the beginning. Sooner or later, we'll find something that ties everything together. That's when we can make our move, . And thus, Raidou took the case. Neither he nor Narumi suspected the the forces responsible would shake the Capital to its very foundation.  Episode 1  -  End Okay, so whaddya want? We've got a lot of work to do here, so if you just want to hang out, do it somewhere else. Hang out? Excuse me! I came here today as a client! Ohhhhh no! No way, no how. Now beat it, y'hear? Take your noise somewhere else. Like I said, we're really busy. Really? Really busy, huh? If you're going to feed me lines, I'd appreciate it if you did a better job. Are you guys honestly that busy, Raidou? Nod*gasp* Not you too! Do you see that, Mr. Narumi? You're a bad influence. Just let me say my piece-- it won't take long. See that? It's nice to have an honest detective in this town. Just be a man and listen to me for a minute, okay? Fine, okay. You made your point, dollface. I'm listening. So, what's the caper? Did you drop your wallet somewhere?  in Ginza-Cho for an interview the other day. So, on the way back, I spotted a big crowd in front of the restaurant... I asked for the skinny, and this guy tells me the  had shown up. The Red Cape!? That's right. I figured you would've heard of him. He's some strange fella who's been seen all over the Capital-- ...supposedly to kidnap children and attack the elderly. Before that, I had assumed he was just a fictional character. ...Just a rumor started by all the anxiety of the Capital today. But, this is a photo I took right as I left the restaurant... Take a look. ...Unthinkable! That's the monster ol' Daidouji turned into! This would be enough to change anyone's mind. The Red Cape's no rumor... He really exists right there, clear as day! ...And, you want us to catch this Red Cape? Exactly! How'd you know? You couldn't let a mystery like this slip by, could you? Slow down there, Tae. No reason to put myself in harm's way. Are you sure about that? The owner of Ryugu told me something interesting during our interview... How are you going to pay all those bills, Mr. Narumi? Aren't they stacking up pretty high? ...... I don't mind paying in advance. Say no more! We would be honored to accept your request, Ms. Asakura! ...*sigh* At any rate, I figure you'll want to hold onto this picture for the investigation. Here you go, Raidou. It's time for you to rustle up some info on Red Cape.  Raidou obtained the . ...Yeah, that's mutated Kiyoshi, alright. No doubt about it. We let him escape from the Daidouji Residence, but we'll get him this time. It's a good thing he turned up, at any rate... If we can nab him, it should get us one step closer to finding Kaya.   can now be reached  on the Main Map. ...So, Tae, baby! Where's that money? Uh... Come to think of it, I don't have any cash on me. I am sorry. I'll just have to pay you later. I'm sure I can get you the money before Raidou wraps up this investigation. Tch... dames. Hey Raidou, any progress in the investigation?  Raidou updated Narumi on the case. Let me sort this out... Kiyoshi Daidouji was a regular at Ryugu... ...and the red-caped monster appeared in that area. We've been after Red Cape because of Tae, but... ...it might get us somewhere in the Daidouji case. *sigh* I guess we should be happy we're getting all these cases... Raidou, I want you to stay on the Red Cape's trail, cause we don't get paid until you nab the Red Cape. ...Which reminds me! Tae called earlier. She was checking in on you... Ahhh, I don't really like that. She's our client, not our boss. But, I'm buried in work here as it is, so... Can you take care of that, too? Tae said she had found out something important, and wanted to talk to us about it. ...I personally think we're doing fine on our own--but we have to keep things copacetic with our client. Tae's putting her article together at the soda joint in Ginza. So, do me a favor and go listen to whatever she has to say.  The phone rang. ...Narumi Detective Agency. Who is this? I haven't seen you around lately, Mr. Narumi. ...!? I was wondering if we could discuss your running tab... ...This is going to take a while, so we should head over to the soda joint. ...I wish I could wrap my head around all this Red Cape business. Daidouji and Denpachi were acquaintances, right? ...But, what would cause both men to turn into Red Cape? Not only that, but I just spoke to Tae over the phone. I asked when she planned on paying us, since we found Red Cape. So, she says to me... The same red-caped monster has been seen all across the Capital. Does that mean there are others besides Kiyoshi and Denpachi that can turn into Red Cape? ...Anyway, she's not going to pay us until we've solved the entire Red Cape mystery. How can she do this to us after you worked so hard? *sigh* You know... I really do feel sorry for that Denpachi fellow. Yeah, he committed a crime... But, he deserved a better death than that, don't you think? He made an honest living running the rickshaw... He loved his sister... Raidou... His last words were about Kiyoshi Daidouji, right? I'd like you to check out the Daidouji Factory. If we're going to find any leads into Kaya's abduction--they're going to be in that factory. We have to puzzle all this out before any more victims turn up. Every man has a right to live normally and die normally... This Red Cape business is simply unnatural... Well, at least Denpachi survived in the end... Yes, he committed a crime... But, once he's made peace with that, he can go back to living an honest life like anyone else. I'm sure his loving sister will be there for him through it all. Hey, Raidou, Denpachi gave you information on Kiyoshi, right? Would you mind checking out the Daidouji Factory? It's probably our best chance of finding a lead in Kaya Daidouji's abduction. ...We can't let this Red Cape situation go on for much longer. Normal, upstanding people shouldn't have to turn into monsters. So, Raidou... If we can't stop this, it's only going to get worse. ...I'm counting on you. I took the liberty of digging up some dirt on that factory Denpachi mentioned. It's the Daidouji Factory, located in Fukagawa-Cho, Senju-Ku. It's owned by Kiyoshi Daidouji, so it must tie in somehow. Business was fine for a while, but they've since gone bankrupt. Kiyoshi did what he could, but I guess there was no way he could save the business. The factory's closed down and the land is up for sale to pay down his debt. I assume he wanted to keep his factory... until the very end. Raidou, I need you to go to the factory and see if Kiyoshi is hiding out there. But, be careful. Tae mentioned something... ...I guess Red Cape's been seen around the factory. She was real excited, and flapping about going there to get the scoop. I tried to tell her it'd be dangerous, but she wouldn't listen... Dames. So uh, do me a favor, okay? While you're looking for Kiyoshi... ...make sure Tae stays outta trouble too, wouldja? ...That certainly sounds like an ordeal, Raidou. A Dark Summoner... If I had to guess, I'd wager he's going to get in the way of our investigation. At least you were able to save those factory workers, right? Not to mention Tae. ...But, we can't sit by while that Dark Summoner continues doing who-knows-what. And, like you said... He knows where Kaya Daidouji is. I still wish we had more to go on, but at least this is something. Still, who could this Rasputin guy be, really? I have come with a missive of import for Raidou Kuzunoha the 14th... ...Hm? Heeeey, how have you been? Fancy a drink? Maybe a smoke? Please spare the frivolity, this is an urgent matter. Raidou, I've come about the Dark Summoner you encountered. Rasputin is a Russian monk who, according to records, perished fifteen years ago. But, in actuality he is a Dark Summoner--one who is beyond our sphere of influence. Hold the phone... We toil, using the power of Devil Summoners, to maintain peace in this world. Not only in Japan, but also other countries around the world. However... there are some who resent our control, and choose to reject this arrangement. However... there are some who choose to use their powers for selfish ends. We don't know the motives of such summoners, but their values are different from ours. We refer to them as Dark Summoners. Though we know not what they are after, we do know their skills are unmatched. If you choose to approach Rasputin, use the utmost caution.  The Herald of Yatagarasu left. ...Must really be dangerous if she came all this way. ...In any case... ...going after Rasputin is about all we can do at this point. The missing girl, the mystery of Red Cape, the Hiruko... Rasputin's the only guy we know who has all the answers. I'll work through the details a little bit later. You need to rest first. Right... Uh huh... Okay, thanks. I'll talk to you later. ...I knew finding other clues wouldn't be easy. The only leads we have are that his name's Rasputin and he's Russian. Eee hee hee... Hello, Mr. Narumi. And, how're you doing, kid? It's not like you to leave the shop. Something the matter? Well you see, I do have a problem of sorts... It's been some time since I last received any shipments. I've just about run out of stock and it's hurting business. Out of stock? So just place an order for more goods. Oh, how I wish it were something that simple. I've always ordered my stock from  in Harumi-Cho. Lately though, my shipments from Harada have been disappearing. I gave them a phone call and discovered Mr. Harada had passed away recently. I'm very sorry to hear that, but I do have important detective work to get back to. Please send along our condolences, though. You must let me finish, Mr. Narumi. I came here for your service! Huh? My service? That's right. Mr. Harada's passing doesn't explain anything about the disappearing cargo, does it? They haven't stopped business-- they keep shipping out product. ...Yet I don't have any merchandise. Does that seem ordinary to YOU? You should enjoy this one.  Co.'s cargo is disappearing. None of my associates have had this problem. The cargo's unloaded from the ship and then... poof! Gone. ...So? What do you think? ...Well, the goods are clearly being taken at night, after they're unloaded but before you come. That was my assumption as well, naturally. So... I hired more sailors to stand watch over the shipment, intent on spotting the thief. But, all of a sudden, everything just vanished into thin air. ...And not just the cargo. Several of the sailors disappeared too. Disappeared right in front of their fellow sailors... Interesting, isn't it? I'm listening. So, whether you care about saving my business or simply satisfying your curiosity... ...could you do something about this situation? Do something...? What the heck am I supposed to do!? You're a detective, aren't you? I'm sure you'll figure something out. Otherwise, I'll be forced to close down Konnou-Ya. And, if that happens, you'll be affected too, am I right? ...Technically, yeah... Then we have a deal! I'm counting on you two. ...Fine. Hey, hold on a minute... You said , right? As a matter of fact, I did. Well, that works out for us. Harumi-Cho is the Capital's largest seaport. Raidou, I want you to investigate Harumi-Cho and try to figure out this Konnou-Ya cargo caper. ...And while you're there, maybe ask some people about our Russian comrade. Da? I'll try working my usual channels, as well.   can now be reached on the Main Map. Welcome back, Raidou. What's the good word from Harumi-Cho?  Raidou filled Narumi in on the details. So... Still no dirt on Rasputin then, huh? As for the Konnou-Ya case, it's all riding on what happens to that next ship. Harada's in a fix. It's a bizarre case, that's for sure... But, it doesn't seem to have anything to do with Rasputin. On the other hand, I checked with the Department of the Interior about Rasputin. ...And didn't find anything either. There isn't record of any foreigners named Rasputin being in Japan. But then, I had a thought... If Rasputin's an illegal alien, we aren't going to find him via legal means, are we? Would you mind contacting the Haguro-gumi again? Satake's well versed in the Capital's... seedier happenings. I think we've got a chance running that angle. At least, it's the best bet we've got. Whaddya say, Raidou? One mystery leads to another, and this case keeps getting bigger and bigger. We helped out the owner of Konnou-Ya and that's swell, but... ...in the end, we still haven't managed to find Kaya. What we did find was a curious mechanical man. And, according to his story... Something called the Super Soldier Project is underway. And, Kaya is involved in that very project somehow. Assuming our clockwork friend is on the level... This case goes a lot deeper than a simple kidnapping. It could be bigger than we ever thought possible. So I take it we're going to believe what the Dark Summoner told us about Kaya. ...Kasumidai, huh? Not sure the military would let us just waltz on by, but-- You boys miss me? Got another favor to ask, if you've got the time. We've had an earful of your talk already, doll. Beat it. Give it a rest, Shouhei. ...We got a strange phone call at the newspaper today. Believe it or not, it was some big cheese from the military. ...The military!? Yes, and he wants to tell us about some spiffy new military project. ...Smells fishy to me. Same thing the boss said, but think about it... Military personnel leaking hush- hush information? Kind of risky, if it's just a prank. He had a name for it and everything-- called it the Super Soldier Project. No, this guy sounded on the up and up; to me, at least. Bare minimum, he's worth a listen, don't you think? ...Listen? You're actually gonna meet this mug? I'll say. We've already made plans to meet up in Kasumidai this afternoon. Which brings us to the favor. ...Can you come with me, Shouhei? I mean, if he's leaking military secrets, it's a sure bet the military will be watching. That's a dangerous situation for a girl like me to be in alone. ...You're only helpless when it works to your advantage. Kasumidai though, huh? Raidou, would you mind accompanying our friend Tae on her date? It is, after all, about a top-secret military project. This could be the big break we're looking for. ...Even if Tae's been fed a line, at least she'll get you into Kasumidai, right? Super Soldier Project...? What a whopper. So, you're coming along, Raidou? Thank you. Let's forget that wallflower and scram, shall we?  Raidou and Tae left the detective agency. A Super project, huh? Could it... Nah, that was a long time ago...   can now be reached on the Main Map. Kaya Daidouji... After all that searching, here she is in our office. So, they were performing some sort of hocus-pocus underground? I don't even want to know, just as long as she's okay. Uh-Um... Where am I? Looks like our Jane is waking up. ...Oh, you're... the detective. Nice to see you too, doll. Glad you're all right. My well-trained subordinate Raidou found you in an underground facility of some sort. Raidou... Well, I mean, remember that I'm the one who put him on the job. Oh, is that so? Thank you very much for your efforts, Mr. Raidou, Mr. Narumi. So... do you remember all that kill me noise? Care to explain it to us? ...My family has a terrible curse passed down every generation-- The demon possession, right? Yes... The girls are killed when they turn 16... ...Sounds like a bum rap. A-As my birthday came closer, my father started looking at me differently... Then, one day, he put me in an underground cell. ...Which is that cavern Raidou found, I'd wager. Yes, that's right. I didn't want to hurt anyone... But, I didn't have the courage to end my own life, either. Th-That's when my uncle said he knew how to save me. He said if w-we exorcised the demon, I could go on living as a normal girl. It's all I could think about. So, as instructed by my uncle... I snuck out of the house without my father noticing. ...... But... the man who was waiting for me outside wasn't my uncle; it was Munakata, the military officer. Munakata, huh... All that talk of exorcising the demon was just a lie. All they really wanted was to take the power of that demon for themselves. I... I managed to break free, and ran. But, if I went back home, Father would still have killed me. I had nowhere to go... I... I didn't know what to do. ...So you called us. Right. I was just... I was so lost, and I didn't have anyone else to turn to. I see. So, where do you plan to go from here? I...... You go back home, you're still left holding the bag, right? ...But, walking around on your own just makes you a target for Munakata again. ...That's the ticket! Why don't you work with us here at the detective agency? We've been looking for a secretary to get me away from this paperwork anyway, right Raidou? Sure.See? Even Raidou thinks so. Everything's swell. Oh, sucks to you. Don't worry about him, Kaya. Raidou can be a real wet blanket sometimes. ...Are you sure it's fine? Having a bird around'll do this place some good. Besides, it's dangerous for you out there. Well, if you really don't mind, it sounds nifty to me! Absolutely! Now that's a good excuse to celebrate! And so, our little lost girl became a part of the Narumi Detective Agency. But, it wasn't over. No, that was simply the beginning of an even larger case. . Narumi's already gone. Looks like he decided to get out and do something for a change. ...No reason to panic, though. We don't have any proof he's actually on a job. This is the owner of Konnou-Ya. Is Mr. Narumi there?  Raidou explained that Narumi stepped out of the office. Oh, he's not there? His order came in. He'd told me it was urgent. Would you mind coming to pick it up? I want to make sure he gets it as soon as possible. I'm paid in advance you know, so I don't like holding onto merchandise that's already sold. Hurry on over; there's no value in dallying!  The owner of Konnou-Ya hung up. Great, the one time Narumi's not sitting here, his order comes in. It looks like Kaya's left the building as well. *sigh* Raidou Kuzunoha and Gouto, professional errand boys. Oh, Raidou... You're back. Me? Oh, I just went out to get some fresh air. ...What's the matter? You look all balled up. ...Oh, it's my hair, right? Um... Do you like it?Smile and compliment her...Thank you! I was afraid you were going to laugh at me. A lot of things have been happening, so I thought a change of pace might do me some good. I'm so glad you don't hate it. ...You don't like it, do you? A lot of things have been happening, so I thought a change might, um... do me some good. ...Maybe it was a mistake, though. ...... Say, Raidou? Mr. Narumi told me you had another name. Would it be all right if you told me what it was? I'd like to call you by your real name.  Raidou told Kaya his real name. ... It's a nice, simple name. I have something I'd like to tell you too, . Could you spare a minute? Back when I was being held captive by Munakata... ...I overheard him talking to someone. He mentioned an object he needed for his Super Soldier Project. And, once he's gotten a hold of this thing... ...he can eliminate millions of Capital citizens, just like that. That's... the kind of thing we should take care of, don't you think? ...To stop his scheming? We should look for it together, ! If we can find it before they do, we might be able to stop them. Munakata described it as... as a crystal ball full of spiritual energy. It was enshrined a long time ago in order to protect the Capital. ...But, he said nobody knows where it is anymore. I bet we could find it though, . Let's start tomorrow! . Are you all set to hunt for that crystal ball thing? ...So the girl's keen on this crystal of infinite power which we don't have a clue where to find. Thanks for nothing, dollface. But, if the Capital is really in danger, we don't have a choice. . Let's see what we can do. Allow me to explain, detective. Or, should I say, Devil Summoner Raidou Kuzunoha... , that guy-- Surprised? I don't blame you. Thank you for the other day, by the way. I was actually sent by the Navy. Sorry I had to keep you in the dark, before. I was on a top secret mission to spy on the Army... Munakata's movements in particular. ...But, the Navy was being monitored as well, and now the situation is rather grave. I trust your ability, Raidou, so I need you to do something for me. Will you come with me? ...Him? Oh, don't worry about Mr. Narumi. We roughed him up a little, but... As long as you cooperate, he won't need to suffer any further. He's pretty much backed us into a corner, here. We'll let Mr. Narumi rest. Please follow me, Raidou. ...Your chums in the Navy explained it all, Raidou. First you save the Admiral, now they expect you to stop Munakata. You've got kind of a bum deal, being used like that. Still, we can't sit by while Munakata goes and has his way with Japan. So... Waden One, huh? It's like his base of operations, isn't it? That's gonna be a real powder keg. Speaking of which... Did you get my order from Konnou-Ya? Hey, thanks a lot.  Raidou handed Narumi the box of ammunition. This is it, all right. I don't like the idea of using this stuff to hurt people... But, a man's gotta defend himself in our line of work, right? You should take some along with you, Raidou. You'll need the extra edge if you're infiltrating Waden One.  Raidou obtained  x24. The rest is mine. You head over to Waden One. ...I have my own business to attend to. All right, you ready to go? It's do-or-die time, Raidou. We can't have some soulless army running around, now can we? ...But, there's one thing I want to say, first. What the Navy told you is only one side of the story. I know-- er, knew a person who wanted the best for this country. He proposed the Super Military Project as a means to revive the nation's glory. There's a lot to this case we still don't know about--including Kaya's role in it all. You're going to have to decide for yourself where the truth lies in all of this. ...I'll be taking care of things on my end. Don't take any wooden nickels out there, got it? ...Aaand, Narumi's not here. Where's that sap wandered off to now? , what's that on the table?  Raidou found a note on the desk. Hey Raidou, I'm sure you'll make it back to read this letter. I thought about your last case, and I shouldn't have put you in such danger. This thing goes beyond kidnapping; it's a nasty conspiracy that could cause a real shake-up. Munakata's plans for the Super Soldier Project... The Navy... ...It's too big a case for a detective trainee like you. If you are safely at home reading this, listen to me and drop this case. As the Chief of the Narumi Detective Agency, it's my job to put an end to this. Please just wait for me to get back. -Shouhei Is Narumi completely ossified!? He can't take this on by himself! ...... ...Oh well, we should at least try to find him, . Munakata's demons are going to tear that moron apart. Still... We need some clue to trace his steps... He mentioned the Navy, didn't he? I probably shouldn't be this surprised that you made it back safely. But, it's not every day a man returns from a dimensional rift. Da? You can relax--I no longer have any reason to attack you. ...Why, you ask? Because my job here is done. I was hired as a bodyguard until the Super Soldier Project was underway. Munakata has no further use for me. With Kaya, that swarm of the dead, and his Soulless God... No one can stop him now. ...Oh, the Soulless God? *chuckle* I suppose there is no harm in telling you. My contract is up. Look out the window. That is the Tai-itsu satellite. It's able to supply an infinite amount of energy using the properties of EL 200. The energy from the satellite will be sent back to the radio towers set up around the Capital. It's with that energy that Munakata will summon the Soulless God. Once that happens, the Capital is through. If you really want to protect the Capital, there's not much time left. ... Why's he telling us all of this? How do we know his contract is actually up? How do we know there ever was a contract!? ...It's your choice, whether you believe me or not. But, you need to realize that if you do nothing, the Capital will be destroyed--no question. You might just be the only one who can stop this. To be honest, I was also entrusted with a specific duty. I gave it up, though. In the end, it wasn't something my pride would allow me to do. The more I saw of Munakata's plan, the less I wanted to be involved. I've realized a number of things since arriving here... ...the foremost of which being that I need to think and act for myself. That's the best way. ...It's the most human way to behave, don't you think so? ...And that is my story. Decide for yourself where to go from here. I will say that if you plan on going after Munakata, you might pay his subterranean facility another visit. You should be able to get in using these two orbs...  Raidou obtained the .  Raidou obtained the . Figure out how to use them yourself. Using them right should open up the  for you. Shouldn't be difficult for you to sneak in unnoticed from there. It's up to you, tsovarich. I'll enjoy watching the show. Raidou versus Munakata... Who will decide the future of the Capital, and all of Japan? ...... ...The Soulless God... Munakata--er, Sukuna-hikona said they were going to annihilate the Capital. At this rate, he's going to be right on the money. But, that thing looks pretty hard-boiled. How are we going to stop it, Raidou? Think about what we've learned up to this point, . It seems like a lot of our cases lately have tied into this Soulless God somehow. If we really knuckle-down and think about this, maybe we can figure it out. Three heads are better than two; get Narumi involved. Talk about the Red CapeRed Cape, huh? Looking back, they must have had it planned out all along. Think about the victims: Kiyoshi Daidouji, Denpachi Iida, etcetera... They all felt very strongly about something, but didn't know what to do about it. The Hiruko are born in ordinary people, right? They used those things to create the Soulless God. I heard the Waden One tower gave off radio waves... ...which drew the Hiruko out of affected individuals. If we'd known about that sooner, we could have stopped it all by sabotaging the radio towers.  Sukuna-hikona was that demon who took control of Munakata... Nobody's going to believe a high- ranking officer was really a demon. But, at least we know the truth, I suppose. There has to be some kind of clue... something he's done...  Talk about the Red CapeThe Tai-itsu satellite... If we believe what Rasputin said, that's gotta be the key. They launched it in order to supply energy to the Soulless God. I have no idea how it all works, but... it could be our solution. If we can blow that satellite up, the monster won't have any power. Only problem is... ...how are we supposed to destroy something so high up?  Fly up and destroy it.Well that's the obvious solution, flyboy, but we don't have the means to pull it off. Airplanes don't exactly grow on trees around here. ...... Hold the phone! Hey, Raidou! Didn't you meet some guy who was into flying and such? Think you could pay him a visit? ...Ask if he would like to help us destroy the satellite. I'll do some sniffing around while you're busy with that. We can't let them destroy the Capital. Let's go! Defeat that thing!? Uh, Raidou? Anybody home? That isn't possible, not even for a Devil Summoner. You saw what it did earlier! It's absolutely out of our league. There's gotta be some other way we can stop it. ...Even you're out of ideas, huh Raidou? *sigh* We can't just sit around here all day, though. There has to be a way we can stop that thing without having to face it head on...  ...There has to be something we're missing. Anything come to mind? ...... What do you think Kaya meant by change history, Raidou? I've heard of dames having mood swings, but Kaya was like a whole different person. The Capital is safe, but did we really finish the job? What about the girl who asked for our help? The girl who, out of desperation, begged us to kill her. Are we going to just forget about her? ...Huh? What's eating you? --dou... Raidou, can you hear me? It's me, Gouto. Go after Kaya. You already have the power to do so. The technique that brought us back from the other world will take you to her. Follow her, and defeat the being that has possessed her--the mastermind behind all this. ; you're Raidou the 14th, after all. Hey, uh... Earth to Raidou. Did you think of a way to help Kaya? Is that it? Yes.I see. I don't think there's much I can do to help at this point, Raidou. This is in your hands now. Don't get me wrong--if anyone can pull it off, I know it's you. ...... You don't need to hide it, Raidou. I won't stop you. Go save the girl! If anyone can pull that off, it's you.                   Say now! I see you've got something good there, Raidou. I'll let you take a break if you'll play me at a game or three. Well, this is the point of no return. No way out now but to destroy this thing.  The core began to move...  A protective wall formed. That barrier mechanism is a real pain in the neck. We'd better destroy it first. Your move, ! (Demon's attack!

I'm glad I stuck around long enough to see this. ...But people on Earth are still depending on us. We've got a job to do. ...We did it. The Capital is saved as long as that Soulless God knows when he's been beat. However, we're not out of the woods yet. Someone used Sukuna-hikona's desire for revenge to give the Soulless God form and a purpose. I'm willing to bet that's tied into the being who took control of Kaya Daidouji, too. Whatever's inside her is hard-boiled, , but it's nothing you can't handle. I've been watching every Raidou since the 2nd, and you're easily the finest of them all. You have done my name proud, Raidou Kuzunoha the 14th!

Don't touch that!  It appears the owner can see demons.  The taxi has been wrecked by the Red Cape.   hefted the taxi and tossed it away!  The taxi flew far away, out of sight.  The wrecked taxi's fare is strewn around the ground.  Raidou obtained .  There's still more money on the ground.  There's no more money on the ground...  Raidou's wallet is full of money.  Raidou's heart is also full of guilt... When the owner of Ryugu is gone, use inspect to find her secret treasure down the alley.  Something is in the bushes on the side of the alley.  Raidou obtained the owner of Ryugu's thingie.  The telephone is ringing. I reckon... So 'twould seem.

Where art thou? Do me a favor, won't you? Could you just... Raidou, go on down to the Gouma-Den, y'hear? With Alice's soul quelled at last, we can meet her once more. Now, see here, Raidou. Once we're done with this dadgum case, we're gonna settle down somewhere nice 'n quiet. We shall live out the rest of our days with her in peace. Those blasted humans had better stay off our lawn, though... Yes, 'tis a grave danger. Humans are the most terrifying creatures to walk the globe. At any moment, they may venture to th' depths of Hades and lay claim to our property. Well, we'll make a quiet place to live in, no matter what it takes.

Um, excuse me, Sir... ...Did you happen to witness the accident that occurred during the last full moon? Yes.Y-You did!? ...Can you remember any details? Who was involved? Please, tell the police what you know! ...I don't think you should toy with her emotions, . She seems pretty desperate. Something serious might have happened to her. ...... You weren't there? I-I see... ...I see. Thank you for your time. ...... My husband was assaulted while driving his taxi... and that caused an accident. ...He was seriously injured. But, the police still haven't found any suspects. So I thought by asking people who passed by here, I might find a witness... ...Though I haven't had much luck so far. Sorry for wasting your time. I appreciate your honesty.  She walked away. Mr. Narumi hired a young kid like you? This is the first I've heard of it. So he can pay you a salary, but can't pay his bills? How nice. ...Sorry, I was just mumbling to myself. So, it's Raidou, right? How can I help you? Show her the Red Cape photo Raidou showed the photo of the Red Cape to the Owner. ...Oh, I saw this in the Capital Daily. He wrecked one of our customer's cars... Don't think he'll be coming back here again... *sigh* It was in Ms. Asakura's article. She came here and showed me that same photo. Saying he's a monster is just a euphemism, right? He's just some lunatic the police should be after. ...Chased all our customers away is what he did. *sigh* The police are never around when y'need 'em. Well, at least we know that Red Cape monster's been in the area recently. , why not ask her about Kiyoshi Daidouji, too? Considering the nature of her business, who knows what she might have heard. Show her the Red Cape photoDaidouji...? Oh, you mean the wealthy man from Yarai-Ku. I haven't seen him since his company went bankrupt. Back when he had the dough, he was in here more than once a week. He was a very courteous gentleman. I'd gladly give him a job here.  . Show her the Red Cape photoHe's one of our employees-- the rickshaw runner. He's been here even longer than me, so he's quite the old-timer. ...Maybe Denpachi knows something about Mr. Daidouji that I don't.  . Tell him I sent you.    can now be reached on the Main Map. You come here so often now, you're practically a regular. Just make sure you don't stiff us like that other detective. ...So, how can I help you? Huh? Denpachi again, huh? That's something I'd like to know, myself. He hasn't shown up for work today. another taxi attack in Ginza-Cho, though. Everyone's scared to use taxis, so the rickshaw requests are piling up. *sigh* Denpachi... Where are you when we really need you? You don't suppose the Red Cape in Ginza could be...? I fOuNd yOU! ...It's a full moon. According to Tae, Red Cape should be appearing any time now. ...!? I sense a strong demon presence. It's about time we came across actual evidence. But, we'll need more than this to nab the culprit. ...Can you think of anyone who might know anything about this knob?  Denpachi was the Red Cape! Ugh... Wh-What was I--? ...Ever since I started losing work, I've been blacking out from time to time... And, all those Red Cape rumors started going around... But, I never... I didn't think... I was the one responsible...! I mean... I... ...I just wanted more work as a rickshaw runner... I blame the man who invented the automobile... and the fools who brought it to Japan! Sir, please... I once took Mr. Daidouji to... ...a ... ...He told me that very factory was... his most cherished place... ...I'm sure you'll be able to find him... there. ......  Denpachi collapsed to the ground... Kiyoshi Daidouji's factory, huh...? ...Well, now that we've found everyone ELSE, it looks like we might have a shot at Daidouji. But, why did it have to end up this way? He didn't deserve to suffer like that. Don't you agree, Raidou? ...Sorry, I don't know what's eating me right now. Let's hurry back to the agency. Automobiles aren't as rotten as you seem to think, Mr. Iida. Whatever makes them go bad, that's something else entirely. ...Who are you? You're a grown man, and I know I can't change your mind. But, I want to give you a message. ...What message? She wants you to hang in there. Th-This is my--! Your sister's a good girl. She cares about you. ...Shizu... She came to the detective agency and asked me to deliver that. ...I'm sorry, Shizu... Forgive me... ...I caused you so much trouble, didn't I...? Here... I want you to have these for all you went through.  Raidou obtained  x2.  The reddish brown mass vanished from Denpachi's body. ...What in the world?  Denpachi collapsed, his body gently relaxing. Dummy Message Huh? What's this? Ugh! My nose! This smells awful, like my dad's socks! ...Eh, might as well bring this back. I wonder if Raidou will be happy or mad...  Raidou obtained the .  Red Cape pulled Raidou into the Dark Realm!  Much of the area is covered in sand. . Let's have a look around.  Raidou and Kaya searched the construction site.  A broken statue was buried in the sand. ...Is this the Irie Fudou? This crystal ball must be the item. The EL 200. Yes, our preparations are now complete. ... Can I ask you a question? It's Taisho 20, right? This is a turbulent time in history--maybe an anomaly. The nation's progress, modernization... People are being tossed about by the rapid societal changes. Yet, so many people have their own ideals about how to live life. How do you feel about it? ...Living in times like this? Some would choose to follow their fated path, as is predestined... ...while others believe fate is a result of their actions--of choices they make. ? What do you believe? I follow my fate....It appears I thought too highly of you. In that case, accept the Capital's fate as it's swallowed by disaster! Forget about Kaya Daidouji, ... Forget about everything that's happened... Accept what was foreordained... ...and die! That's right... We all fashion our lives after some purpose. I seek to wrest a positive future from the grip of this chaotic society! , I want you to bear witness to this action. Join me, Raidou Kuzunoha... ...Together, we can shape an ideal future!  Kaya vanished into the Dark Realm. What's gotten into her!? But, that power as she vanished... It sent shivers down my spine. We'd better get back home, fast! Narumi needs to hear about this! Didn't any of you hear a word I just said? But... haven't you heard what's going on at Harumi-Cho? If you go there now, you might not come back in one piece... I might've given up my claim to the name, but inside, I'm still part of Harada  Co. As long as I was in Harumi-Cho, I wouldn't mind dying. S-So you don't care about us!? You're just gonna go off to die and leave us here all alone!? ...... ...Awww, get back to work, you big lugs. We all still have a lot of work to do right here. Sorry, guys. I promise to stay right here as long as there's work to be done. This area's bustling with people, but only a few of 'em are locals. Most of them are shoppers and businessmen. Folks take streetcars in from the suburbs to Ginza-Cho. All of us streetcar operators were concerned about the taxis being attacked left and right... Fortunately for us, there haven't been any reports of streetcars being targeted. It gave me a pretty bad scare when I heard about the Red Cape hitting the taxis. Fortunately for us, there haven't been any reports of streetcars being targeted. I just saw the Red Cape rushing over here... At first I thought, He's gonna destroy the streetcar! But, he didn't give me a second look. The monster's gone, and it turned out he was only interested in automobiles. But with all the incidents-- kidnappings, vandalism--I'm praying no one attacks streetcars. For taking short trips, we have automobiles and streetcars. For international travel, we use ships. The Capital's transportation network is really coming into its own. Our country is booming! Ships have streetcars beat when it comes to cargo capacity... Pretty soon, Harumi-Cho and its shipyards will completely eclipse our Ginza-Cho. I once heard a rumor that they were going to use the rails for military operations... What were they going to do, make streetcars with cannons and tommy guns? A famous man in London said that any developed city needs to have a subway. Streetcars running underground... The day might not be far off! Streetcars need both passenger cabins and railroad tracks. It might sound old-fashioned of me to say so, but the two of them are like a pair of inseparable friends. Streetcars need both passenger cabins and railroad tracks. I guess the modern expression for the way they get along  would be, best buddies. If someone attacks the Capital, we'll all have to evacuate somewhere, right? If that happens, the worst escape method would be, well... the streetcars. All it would take is one large stone on the tracks, and we'd be done for. A lot of curses are detailed in folklore and old wives' tales. They're often related to everyday life. For me, the scariest curse has to do with a phantom train... We were considering a station near Sakuradayama, since the view is so gorgeous. But, the Army is constructing Waden One, so it was forbidden. The military ordered cutbacks on the number of cars per train to reduce movement between cities. Why would they do such a thing? The streetcars are one of our most important transit methods! The Army stopped all streetcar movement because of that lousy ball they sent up... Why would they do such a thing? The streetcars are one of our most important transit methods! That attack felt almost like an earthquake... Luckily, there was no damage to the streetcars. But, if that monster strikes the tracks or the cabins, then you can kiss the streetcars goodbye. Y-You're going to use a rocket against that monster!? ...Well, if you're going to Senju-Ku, a streetcar can get you there! The streetcars will be running double time until Harumi-Cho is back on track. We're no substitute for ships, but we'll give it all we've got! I thought Red Cape was just a rumor, but there he is in that photograph. That picture convinced the higher-ups to focus on this case... But, I'm not too sure about it. The very idea of investigating a supernatural monster like that has me absolutely petrified. I'd rather deal with the Kantou Haguro-gumi. ...No, now that I think about it, they're both terrifying. Whoever you're looking for, it's not important right now. I'm investigating the monster. If it's a missing person you want, go talk to a detective. The taxi attacks are intriguing, but I have other things on my plate right now. I'm still investigating that monster... As far as I'm concerned, everyone here is a suspect... ...What rotten luck. Detective Kazama was working that Daidouji case, but now he's decided to help us out instead... It's hard enough tracking down the monster without having to deal with that guy! This couldn't be worse. Detective Kazama turns on his subordinates when he's cranky. It's even worse than I'd heard. Don't miss even a single strand of hair! he barked. He's a monster too, in his own way... Holy cats, it's the Red Cape! He's here! How am I supposed to book him? There's nothing about monsters in the police training manual! The other day, that monster was right in front of me, but I was scared stiff... It was my most shameful moment as a police officer. Detective Kazama went to Senju-Ku to investigate the Daidouji Factory. There was an incident with some fat cat. Trouble seems to arise wherever you are, y'know... So, some foreigner told you about a connection between the Army and a female student? You better clam up about that stuff, mister. You don't want the Army getting wise. A girl vanished at Kasumidai in broad daylight, right under the noses of the police and the Army? You better clam up about that stuff, mister. You don't want the Army getting wise. Now you're telling me the Army is building a warship, and you have the project documentation? You better clam up about that stuff, mister. You don't want the Army getting wise. Detective Kazama's off duty today. I hope he doesn't decide to make a surprise inspection. He puts a lot of pressure on us. It's hard to work with that guy breathing down our necks. Since those automobiles are becoming so popular, I think the squad should get a few. It's just not very modern to patrol on foot. Someone is bumping people off in the Capital? Probably some teenager with nothing to do... Only they'd have the time and energy for that sort of thing. Funny, usually the Navy soldiers wouldn't give a private detective the time of day. The guy they're holding now must really have gotten their goat. That's odd. The sky over Koutou-Ku looks more red today. Am I seeing things? My eyes must be playing tricks on me... I'm none too happy that the soldiers are acting so superior. Now that they've put us under martial law, we have to jump when they say so. What the hell are they doing out there? It's noise pollution! The police weren't notified of this! But, it's not like we can raise a stink. We're under martial law now, so they call the shots. The monster in Harumi-Cho used to be a scrapped Navy warship, but the Army refitted it. The rub is, no one in the Army seems to have known about it... They're as clueless as us. Detective Kazama said he's going to arrest that monster when it shows its face again... For all his bluster, there's an air of desperation about that man.  The patrolling policeman's spirit was rekindled. Whoever's behind it, I'll take 'em! Red Cape? Bring 'im on! I'll grab that cape of his and drag him through the streets! Kantou Haguro-gumi is no problem for me! Not when I've got this badge on my shirt! Looking for someone, huh? Well, you know you can count on me! I'll find your man in no time flat once I defeat this monster! Looking for the taxi stalker, huh? Well, you know you can count on me! I'll crack the case in no time flat once I defeat this monster! Detective Kazama talks big, but he can't ruffle my feathers! Once I'm promoted, he'll be buying his own sandwiches! From now on, I'm hitting it on all sixes! Not even a single hair will slip by me! I know the manual urges quick thinking and action at times like this... But... I'm scared stiff! If that monster shows his face again, just let me at him! I'll grab that cape of his and drag him through the streets! You can't be a policeman if you're the sort who doesn't take every case seriously. After all, keeping the Capital safe is our most important duty! There's a link between a schoolgirl and the Army!? This sounds like scandal in the making! Are you sure about this? You're not putting me on, are you? A girl up and disappeared from Kasumidai!? This sounds like scandal in the making! A kidnapping right in front of the military top brass... She's probably just in the restroom. The Army has been building their own warships? This sounds like scandal in the making! Aren't Army operations restricted to land? It's one thing if they build tanks, but... I'll overcome the expert's presence with beginner's luck! I won't let Detective Kazama's criticism get me down! Don't think patrolling is just walking around! I have to be ready for anything. It's more tiring than you'd think. I use my sharp mind and eagle eyes just as much as my fleet feet... What the--!? Bumping off everyone in the Capital!? Too bad for them they forgot about the police department! I won't let them get away with this! Nowadays, the lowliest civilian could rub out the prime minister at a train station. It's my duty to arrest every last suspicious civilian. It's their own fault for being suspicious! The sky looks red because of the burning passion in my eyes! Look into these eyes! You see it? Do you see the fire in my gaze!? Soldiers can't act like know-it- alls just because they've seen action on the battlefield! Us policemen are out on foot every day, keeping the peace in the Capital with our bare hands! The hell are you talking about!? You think I don't care!? Noise pollution is a huge concern of mine, especially when there's no advance notice! We can act as brave as we want, but on the inside, we're all scared to death of that thing. But, rather than regret what we've done, we should take hope in the future. Fat chance we'll be able to  arrest a humongous thing like that! Man, it looks so keen... Er, forget I said that. You know what I'm talking about, though. Hang a left when you leave the station and go down the road a bit to reach the Shin-Sekai soda joint. It's a swanky little soda parlor. Whenever I'm with a Jane, I take her there. Hang a left when you leave the station and go down the road a bit to reach the Shin-Sekai soda joint. You know that reporter Tae? I see her there pretty often. I was trying to win her over, but she played it pretty cool until I threw in the towel.  The soda joint's regulars are a pretty unique bunch. It can be a blast just chewing the fat with 'em. Even if you go stag, you won't be bored. You're going to Ryugu? Go beneath the overpass and then straight ahead. I've been taking that same route to Ryugu ever since I was a boy your age. Yes indeed. Going to Fukagawa-Cho? That city has been dangerous ever since I was a boy your age. You were just in Fukagawa-Cho? And you're mixed up with Kantou Haguro-gumi? That's a pretty big risk you're taking. That city was dangerous even back when I was your age. You went to Fukagawa-Cho? You were kidnapped, but escaped? I'm glad you made it out safely. That city has been dangerous ever since I was a boy your age. I see that girl pretty often around here. Not today, though. I fell in love with a girl who looked just like her when I was about your age. Say, do you know if that girl has a boyfriend? When she snubs me, it breaks my heart twice as hard... ...since she looks so much like the girl I loved when I was your age. If you're headed to Kurisu-zaka, just go underneath the overpass and past the construction site. Ahh, Kurisu-zaka... It hasn't changed a bit since I was your age. I heard there are demons haunting Kurisu-zaka. It's the same story I've heard since I was a boy your age. I don't believe a whit of it. I wouldn't be surprised if some folklore- headed fool was up to some hanky-panky with that monster. Someone got arrested for that kind of hanky-panky when I was a boy your age. Wh-When I was your age... I mean,  a long time ago... I never would have thought that monsters really existed! I'm no good at chasing anything down these days. Arthritis in the hip, you know. If I were still as young as you, though, I would have chased that thing down easy as pie. I never dreamed foreigners would enter the Capital when I was your age. I remember well the time when Japan kept to itself. My, my, how times change. Ship accidents happened all the time when I was a boy your age. Even so, there were always some hardy sailors that wouldn't let an accident or two stop them. When I was a boy your age, my family was dirt poor, so I had to borrow money to ride the fishing boats. I was constantly upchucking on deck. I felt like a dead man the entire year I was on that ship. When I was-- When I was your father's age, this country was always in some war or another. Nowadays, people are worried about monsters, since the country has been at peace for so long. When I was-- When I was your father's age, this country was always in some war or another. The people were crushed by taxes that fool assembly kept raising, to pay for the war effort. When I was-- When I was your father's age, this country was always in some war or another. The soldiers from back then are leaders today. That's why they're so keen on starting another war. I was a hopeless romantic when I was a boy your age. Sometimes I'd cry all night until sunrise, but now that I think back on it, I miss those days... I was so desperate to get the girls to notice me when I was your age. I went to stylish stores to buy stylish clothes. Nothing was more important then than being modern. It was my pride that ruined all those relationships when I was your age. If I hadn't acted that way then, my life would have been very different... I was obsessed with the supernatural when I was your age. Ghosts, curses, the whole ball of wax. But, the more I learned, the more knowing they were around gave me the heebie-jeebies. So I lost interest. This newfangled radio thing is something I didn't expect when I was your age. I gave one a try and felt like I was walking around with my own little phone booth. This area was very strictly patrolled when I was your age. Today, too... Ever since those soldiers set up martial law, no one comes near this place. That thing that flew up into the sky... I saw something like that when I was your age. Was it a bomb? No... I have a terrible feeling that something nasty is about to happen. The military starting wars with the pretense of strengthening this country... It's just like when I was your age. They want to get rich through military conquest. How many civilians will die before they take notice? When I was your age, the government went through money like candy, to develop new weapons. Why try to become the strongest nation if it only leads to trampling over your own people? Just like when I was your age, investing in war means less money for other things. On the other hand, we do always end up stronger after a war. We always rise out of the ashes. I quit being a taxi driver. Driving a taxi pulls down too much heat these days. I ain't getting any hazard pay, y'know? I figure I can still give people rides if I switch to rickshaw running. That monster hates automobiles, right? I-Is he out to get me, too? He can't come after me! I don't even drive a taxi anymore! Now that the whole Red Cape business is over, I might take up taxi driving again. No matter what anyone says, I think you're always better off doing what you know. Whew, that monster sure smashed up a lotta taxis. I'm off duty today, but how can I enjoy my vacation with this kind of thing staring me in the face? Those rookies just say Yes, Sir! and then go right back to loafing on the job. A smart cookie could whip them into shape, but I gotta admit, I wasn't promoted because of my smarts. That monster is something else! There's no way to catch him in a straight chase. You'll have to tire him out somehow, first... Hmm... That Denpachi guy was behind the taxi attacks, eh...? ...... Is something wrong?I checked out those wrecked jalopies and they were absolutely ruined. A total loss. There ain't a human alive that can smash up an automobile like that, even with tools! I was just thinking, Denpachi lost his job cause of these automobiles... But, I can't pity that guy, no matter how low he looks. He is a criminal, after all. So, some hapless schoolboy's in deep with the military, huh? I bet you already know aaall about  it, don't you Raidou? Hrmph. Say... That girl in the Ouran High uniform, underneath the overpass... Isn't she...? Spill the beans about Kaya.That's an earful! C'mon pal, don't you think the police would know if that dame showed her face? ...Oh, wait, I ain't even on duty today. Whoopsie-daisy. Geez, am I turning into a workaholic? Hey! Look at me when I'm talkin' to you! Or else I'll use these  here handcuffs and... Beating a guy up with a bunch of your pals isn't mob justice, it's just a lynching. Those soldiers are going way beyond the pale. They oughtta be ashamed of themselves. You're gonna peep on Major General Munakata? I think you're picking on the wrong guy this time. That ain't advice so much as a warning. You better do whatever it takes to call off Narumi. That's if you don't want him to die, I mean. I saw the monster at Harumi-Cho... And geez! There's more than one of 'em! I'll take care of it myself.Not a chance, pal. I can't let you go alone. You know I saw an Ouran High schoolgirl on that monster's shoulder? A man like me can't just sit back and let the civilians take care of everything. A monster that could show up anywhere, anytime, spooks the entire city. If you gotta stop it at the source, then that's what we'll do! Let's put a stop to this together!  Detective Kazama's spirit was rekindled. Night, day, it's all the same to us. We're not as lazy as you private detectives! We don't need any amateurs! We don't even need sleep! Just go home and sip your tea. You gotta put your life on the line in an investigation! That cautious, by-the-book line is worthless! Go with your gut. It's all just experience! There's absolutely no reason not to be straight with yourself. You have to look your problems square in the eye! Young guys gotta leap before they look! So what if you take a spill? You're insured, aren't ya? You wanna scrap with the Army? Go right ahead! I've got a mad-on for those guys myself! Never forget your true nature, cause if you lose that inner essence, you're sunk. Me, I'm a police detective. Every second of every day, that's what I am. I never let up! Narumi oughtta be ashamed of himself! All it takes is a few soldiers to make him quake in his boots? I don't care who they are! If it were me, I'd take out 10, 20 minimum! The bigger they are, the more fun it is to take 'em down! And you tell Narumi I said that! Who cares if he's weak! If he had any real spirit, he'd be tearing 'em up just like me! I don't care how many monsters come at us, and I don't give a rip how big they are! If they attack me, they're just begging to be arrested! Bring 'em on! ...... ...Wha--!? Oh! It's you, Raidou! Hey, you really look different. You look like a man, now. ...I used to be the leader of the punks here, fighting all day... But, now I'm sporting this cherry blossom crest, workin' on the side of the law. Even though I'm using cuffs instead of my fists, I still hate crooked things. Bein' a flatfoot is the life I picked, thinkin' with what little brains I got... It lets me be myself. You've got the same eyes I did when I was young: reckless, yet straightforward. ...Take this, will ya? When you get to be my age, make sure you don't lose that spark in your eyes.  Raidou obtained the . The Kachidoki-bashi that's visible from Harumi-Cho opens up in the center. N-Not that I want to see it open... The Kachidoki-bashi that's visible from Harumi-Cho opens up in the center. Huh? You've been to Harumi-Cho? I-I see... Huh? No, I'm not jealous... Oh, the Army HQ and Diet Building are both in Kasumidai. N-Not that I want to see them... Ooh, the Army HQ and Diet Building are both in Kasumidai. Jeepers, you went to Kasumidai? I-I see... No, I'm not jealous... I guess I'll end up as a teacher. Oh... well, it's what my mom wants. You're an apprentice detective, aren't you? Meaning you'll be a full-fledged detective soon... Me? Oh, I guess I'll... become a teacher. My mom told me to... There's a radio tower in Sakuradayama called the Waden One. N-Not that I want to see it... There's a radio tower in Sakuradayama called the Waden One. Jeepers, you went to Sakuradayama? I-I see... No, I'm not jealous... I'd like to be an architect, so I'm interested in seeing the Kachidoki- bashi from Harumi-Cho... But, my mom would never forgiv-- ......  The distressed student's thoughts can be heard... I really do want to see Kachidoki-bashi... But, mom would never let me leave the school district. I'd love to go to Harumi-Cho and gaze at Kachidoki-bashi... I yearn to visit the Army HQ and Diet Building at Kasumidai... But, mom would never let me leave the school district. What a lucky skunk... I'd die to go to Kasumidai and see the Diet Building... Mom says it's my patriotic duty to have a career that trains kids to support our country... But, I'd still rather become an architect... Mom insists that I become a teacher... What am I supposed to do about my dream to become an architect? I'd be thrilled to go see Waden One in Sakuradayama... But, mom would never let me leave the school district. Mom would have a fit if I left the school district, but... Surely it'd be fine if I went to Harumi-Cho for a little while? Yes! I'll sneak over there alone! She'll be pretty steamed when she finds out, but what's the worst that could happen? I think I hit something when I was backing up. I got out to see what happened... ...and I still can't be positive what it was that I hit... I think I hit something when I was backing up. Strange, though... there's not a scratch on the car. Still, it's not moving! I just bought this thing! A car that doesn't go anywhere is just a big metal box! I think I hit something when I was backing up. Strange, though... there's not a scratch on the car. Boy, it would be just my luck if it was already broken. Taxis are such a waste of money, too... I think I hit something when I was backing up. Strange, though... there's not a scratch on the car. I can't find anything wrong under the hood. Is this some kind of a joke!? I think I hit something when I was backing up. I tried to push it, but it wouldn't move an inch. I waited months to buy this car! Come on, you hunk of junk! Move! Please, move! I think I hit something when I was backing up. I tried to push it, but it wouldn't move an inch. Nothing to do now but get down on my knees and pray. Oh, merciful God, please fix my car! I-It worked! I prayed, and now my beautiful car is alive again! The people up above me did complain about the noise, though. Good thing for me they were so understanding after I explained the situation.  The hapless motorist calmed down. Hmm... Well, I guess everything's okay if the paint's not scratched. I did just buy this car, so I want to keep it looking brand new. Hmm... Is it some kind of engine trouble? The way these things work is beyond me. Only the mechanics understand how to fix it. Having a car really kills any desire to hoof it. I don't want to leave my precious car here, but if I have to go to the repair shop, I'll take a taxi. This is a job for a professional mechanic. These cars are so complex, I don't have a clue. It'll cost more money, but I don't have any other choice but to take it in to the shop. I just got this thing a few days ago... It can't already be broken! If it's defective, then the broker has a lot of explaining to do. All I can do now is pray... I doubt it'll fix anything, but it's better than nothing. Please God, move this thing... Please... As soon as I prayed, the engine rumbled to life again. ...But that's impossible... What just happened here? I'm okay... I'm okay, right? Am I gonna be okay if the attacks continue...?  The spooked cart-puller's thoughts can be heard... There's a vicious criminal attacking automobiles in Ginza-Cho. I pull a cart... That's not really an automobile, so I'm safe, right? ......! Oh, sorry... Just ignore me. No, trust me, it's nothing... nothing.  The dry-eyed schoolgirl's thoughts can be heard... Flapping, flapping, everything flapping... the curtains! The skirts! That cape! They all look like monsters! The paper reported a monster sighting, so the one I saw at Ginza-Cho was... real!? *hum* But, I still haven't found what I'm looking for... Wh-What do you want, sonny? I ain't got no money, no nothing...  The seeking hobo's thoughts can be heard.   started listening to his inner voice... *hum* I'll be there for you... when the rain starts to pour... There's a lotta things you can find at the scene of an accident... Like this here lucky charm! Better not tell him I have it, though. He might make a move for it. So he's willing to give us the runaround to conceal a piece of evidence, eh? Though, we don't know if the charm is valuable to our search or not. You could always try negotiating, , if that's more your style. ...I'll leave it up to you, since a cat's options are somewhat limited. *hum* In your eyes, the light, the heat... What do you want from me, sonny? Please sell me that lucky charm.*hum* Wonder why I'm so caught off-guard when I lie... I dunno how you knew about this, but it wasn't easy to get... Gimme 50,000 yen for it. Well, I'm pretty busy. Gotta go... *hum* You always say goodnight... ...I don't want it, then.*hum* Wait, wait, I never had a chance to explain to you... I was just kiddin' around! H-How about 50 yen? Good? Whoa! You are quite a rich man! *hum* Money money money money... ...Yer all talk, sonny. Nothing in life is free, y'know. *hum* I'm just a poor man, I need no sympathy... Sure thing. Don't take too long, or I'll take my business somewhere else. *hum* It's just another day without you. No thanks.*sigh* Fine then... *hum* You always say goodnight... *hum* Here you go, create another label, you wanted to... ...Yer all talk, sonny.

Des... dest...!  The policeman on patrol calmed down. Th-That monster destroyed the car and escaped beneath the overpass! You wait here while I, uh... scare up some backup! Compared to soldiers like us who share trenches with death on the battlefield, police are... ...Well, you see that policeman right there? I could rub him out in the time it takes to snap my fingers. Compared to soldiers like us who share trenches with death on the battlefield, police are... ...Well, you see that policeman right there? I could kill him just by staring at him funny. Behold the majesty of the Soulless God! Truly a glorious sight, but... It's nothing but a weapon. Is that really the way to bring prosperity to our nation? One step crushes city blocks and it demolishes the earth where it moves... The Soulless God is a glorious destroyer... but will that really bring prosperity to our nation? Th-The destroyer we built has left the Capital in ruins... But... We can rebuild from the rubble. The harder we try, the faster the construction will go. Major General Munakata has a plan to improve our nation. We couldn't begin to comprehend it. Fortunately, we don't need to. All we have to do is obey the General. Major General Munakata has a plan to improve our nation. We couldn't begin to comprehend it. The Tai-itsu satellite must be another part of the General's plan. I see... It was built to infiltrate an enemy harbor, then transform and unleash its advanced weaponry. It's a menace to the whole world... Worse than a hurricane or an earthquake! If a government were to gain control of that thing, the resulting crisis would affect everyone on earth! The Army was formed to defend the country, but we were used in the plan to destroy our Capital. I... I'll spend the rest of my life atoning for what I've done. I'll work my fingers to the bone to rebuild it. Well, shucks. The very day I decide to take a stroll around Ginza-Cho, they activate that dadgum martial law. This just isn't my day, it seems. I feel a mite peculiar... It must be that sphere they launched, I'd wager. Guess I'll stroll back home early to get some rest. D-Did you see that? Someone else must have seen it! A red creature crawled out of that old man, and... it flew off! I-It had hands, and a face, too! I'm not crazy, I swear I saw it! Tae is a tough bird. It's not every woman who has the guts to work in the newspaper biz. Our modern society still tends to keep women cooped up at home while men get all the work. Tae is a tough bird. She does her own legwork for the articles she writes. Most reporters just send a stringer to do their grunt work and relax in their frosted-glass offices. I always see her hoofing it with an armful of equipment around all creation. I'm all the way behind Tae. She's working hard to improve women's lots in life. Even her pen name, Kichou, is an homage to the feminist crusader Raichou Hiratsuka. Tae studies hard and works harder. Her ultimate ambition is to write nonfiction books about anthropology. She might come off a little dizzy, but she's a tough cookie. ......  She has passed away... M-My hand slipped off the wheel with all that shaking... I lost control... I-I'm sorry... I'm so sorry! Did you feel that earthquake just now? A lady was caught in front of the Army car when it careened off the road, and she... The soldier tried to brake, but the wheels were caught on the railroad tracks... Modern times simply mean one must be aware of one's surroundings at all times. This is Ginza-Cho, darling. That monster should be more careful during his next rampage. Downtown is so out of fashion. I'm a modern girl of the Taisho era, darling. That dreary Fukagawa-Cho isn't my style at all. If you're looking for an escort, darling, then you're barking up the wrong tree. No mere harlot could hope to live up to my level of class. Try Fukagawa-Cho instead. Modern girls like me only walk if we're in Ginza-Cho. Anywhere else, we wouldn't be caught dead outside a taxi... ...Oh, not that old sap again. What old sap?That old buzzard's been here all the time lately... He's some kind of washed-up troubadour. I can't imagine what goes on inside his fevered mind. How right you are! A grubby old owl shouldn't concern a modern girl like me. That monster hasn't shown its face recently. I won't allow it to return to Ginza- Cho. That ancient throwback doesn't fit in fashionable society. Wh-What!? The monster's back in Ginza-Cho? What do we pay those police for? This is a public menace! My rights are being violated! Working up a sweat in some dreary factory from morning to night is so gauche, darling. I think I shall become a typist--but I'll only work in English. It's a much more modern language than Japanese. Harumi-Cho is a very stylish place, but the ocean breeze gives me split ends. Eternal vigilance is the price of elegance. Occupation, income, education, looks, his preferred brand of suit... There are so many considerations a modern girl must take into account when dating. My ideal man owns a car, and preferably a ship as well. I may want to go overseas, after all. A modern girl must plan carefully for the future when choosing a man. If Ginza-Cho is a modern girl's shelter, then Kasumidai is a soldier's refuge. They may serve the same purpose, but the atmospheres are both unique. Well, I never! Were you trying to sneak a photograph of me? Wanted a trophy to show your tacky little friends, hmm!? Scram, or I shall call the police! A soldier's whole routine is an endless procession of meetings and training, isn't it? All that dreariness explains why Major General Munakata can be such a pill... Konnou-Ya? What is that, some shabby little antique shop? I'm sure I wouldn't know anything about that. A room full of ancient relics is no place for a modern girl like me. The schoolgirl loitering beneath the overpass seems to have gotten a makeover. Maybe close-cropped hair is how girls are doing it these days. You don't know why girls today bob their hair? What a dull and obvious question. It's to become more modern, of course. I don't care for the soldiers or the dignitaries. One must put oneself first, right? It's only after you're taken care of that you can think about others. Ginza-Cho is a refuge for modern women. Sakuradayama is also a refuge, in a way. People visit there to take care of certain... troubles. You were in... the past? Ugh. Those who can afford to go back in time clearly have too little to occupy themselves. A modern man must live in the moment. If you don't, you'll never catch up to the current fashions... What a gauche display! If one must set off fireworks, there is a proper time and place. Desperate bids for attention like this are so old-fashioned. There was a gigantic ship near Harumi-Cho! I only looked away for a fraction of a second, and when I turned back, it had become a monster! That monster is some god called the Soulless God? Did I hear that right? What a stupid joke! Gods are supposed to save people, not destroy them. That thing came out of nowhere, threw its weight around, and then disappeared? Hmph! Let's hope that tacky Choushin fellow doesn't have any friends. This new crowd mentality has so many people under its sway, with the same hair and same clothes. Well, I'll keep my own style no matter what's trendy! I-I'm not interested in being modern...! *sigh* Maybe men prefer modern-looking women... I've been standing here for a while, but the boys only have eyes for that trendy girl... I did it! I changed my look from top to bottom! ...My friend insisted on it... I-I  didn't really want to, but... That monster ran by so fast you could feel the wind in its wake! It mussed up my new hairdo! Doesn't it know how long that took to style...? It was hard to accept that I couldn't keep looking the way that I did. It took a lot of courage to change. But, you know what they say, Worries are cured by action. It's easier said than done, though... A person's inner self can change depending on the environment. Hobbies, for instance... Maybe I should listen to classical music instead of just jazz and ragtime. A person's inner self can change depending on the environment. Friends, for instance... If you make friends with foreigners, you might learn things you wouldn't otherwise. A person's inner self can change depending on the environment. Travel, for instance... Sailing the seas with no destination in mind could really broaden your horizons. Everyone has some part of them they'll defend endlessly... Their pride, their beauty, whatever it is. But, you can't blindly defend yourself forever in life. Sometimes, you have to accept change. Do you know Tae from the Capital Daily? She's always on the offensive. She doesn't know the meaning of the word defend; all she can do is press forward. We act like foreign countries are the enemy because Western troops are supposedly a threat. But with all the foreigners in Harumi- Cho, maybe General Munakata has had a change of heart. New trends have to start somewhere; they don't just come out of thin air. It's like the beginning of a traffic jam; no one knows how they get started. New trends have to start somewhere; they don't just come out of thin air. I wonder who the first person to use the term modern was... New trends have to start somewhere; they don't just come out of thin air. I wish I could figure out who started this trend of modern girls. They deserve the worst... There's no such thing as a trendy curse. They've existed since ancient times, and haven't changed since. I've never come across one before, but I'm positive they're real... My neck used to get stiff from time to time. It always came on suddenly, and it hurt so much. I'm fine now--it hasn't happened in a long time. But, I wonder what it was... In my experience, if you're not sure how to do something, you should just go ahead and try. You'll usually figure it out as you go. I can't condone setting off fireworks in broad daylight, but... I do admire the resolve of whoever set them off. Something so futile takes dedication. This will sound strange, but when I see that monster... I feel like it needs my help. You mean it came out of people's negative emotions? So... does that mean it'll appear again and again? After all, as long as darkness exists... Hatred will never completely be gone from the world. Sure, we defeated that monster now... But, nothing's stopping it from coming back later.  The non-conforming woman's thoughts can be heard...  The transformed woman's thoughts can be heard... It really would be more feminine to wear low-cut dresses... No! No! I'll keep my own style, no matter what! That parasol is adorable! And, those heels make her legs look so long... Oh, no... H-How can I keep my own style when that's what I'm up against? It's important to have an open mind. Trends aren't so bad. I'm glad I changed my looks. I feel so carefree now! If you're looking for Denpachi's place, it's in Fukagawa-Cho, down in Senju-Ku. He's usually home about now. Denpachi wasn't home? That's odd. I hope he's not turning into a workaholic. Working is like breathing for some people. Denpachi became a rickshaw runner after his parents passed away. He had to find a way of supporting his sister without an education. Denpachi acts as a father figure for poor Shizu. And, of course, a father and his eligible daughter will always quarrel. If I've told Narumi once, I've told him a hundred times... Hey, maybe he'll listen to you. Tell him not to put it off until he's old and gray. ...He'll get the message. We're short-handed today... Denpachi picked a fine time to disappear! The cops told me all about it. Denpachi was the one behind the taxi attacks. What a buffoon... Doesn't he know what that'll do to Shizu? Only the living can carry out the last wishes of the dead. Pulling double-duty as Ryugu's owner and the Harada Merchant will be tough, but it's worth it. Sometimes the people around you know you better than you know yourself. Maybe my staff is right, and I'm being stubborn for no reason... But, I'm not changing my mind. No matter what other people say. You're still here? Quit wasting time! Didn't Narumi tell you to pick up the goods? You shouldn't keep the man at Konnou-Ya waiting. I wonder what Narumi wanted from Konnou-Ya. Well, you tell him I wished him luck with the detective gig. Sorry, but I'm the wrong gal to ask about crystals. You should ask the owner of Konnou-Ya.  He looks pretty decrepit, but he's got a better eye and more brains than you'd think. The man in the lab coat under Konnou-Ya... What was his name again...? That doctorate on his wall, the weird glasses, overseas connections... Is he some kind of mad scientist? That so-called scientist in the supposed science laboratory talked to me at Senju-Ku. There's a lot of weird science going on around here. That man under Konnou-Ya, too... It's awful what happened to Narumi. He shouldn't have gone near those soldiers... He can be a little irresponsible, so people sometimes get the wrong idea. It's a crying shame. I'm so relieved that Narumi's feeling better and his agency is back in business... Now maybe that lazy so-and- so can raise enough money to pay his bar tab! The last time Narumi was here, he said he'd pay the tab with his life insurance. Even with such a serious look in his eyes, that man slays me. Whoo-ee, anyone who can set off that many fireworks has to be loaded. If anyone with that much money and that little sense ever comes to power, we're done for. All of my people, both here and in Harumi-Cho, are like family to me. I feel useless because I'm unable to help my family when they need me the most! What am I supposed to do, just work at Ryugu and put Harumi-Cho out of my mind!? ...Sorry. I know this isn't your fault. Shouting at you won't change anything... I can tell just by looking at you that you're about to try something crazy. Consider Narumi's debt cancelled! ...A little present, since you're going away. There's only one condition: you have to come back, okay? Promise me! The owner of Ryugu is on the phone now. I overheard someone getting an earful about some debt... Oh, pardon me, mac. You're too young for all of that. The owner of Ryugu just got off the phone with a boneheaded customer, and... Oh, pardon me, mac. You're too young for all of that. The owner of Ryugu isn't here right now. She's out on business. Me? Oh, I'm just the watchman. You can never be too careful these days. The owner of Ryugu went to Harumi-Cho? Must be looking after the cargo. Me? Oh, I'm just the watchman. You can never be too careful these days. The owner of Ryugu has an extra spring in her step after coming back from Harumi-Cho. ...What's that look for? So, the owner of Ryugu has become a Harada merchant in Harumi-Cho, has she? To be honest, I wonder... Can she handle both at once? You're just in time, mac! You've gotta stop the owner of Ryugu! How can we make her understand? Nobody could take her place here. If anything happened to her, knock on wood, Ryugu would be done for! We did our best to stop the owner of Ryugu from heading to Harumi- Cho. If that monster gets her... What would happen to Ryugu then? Doesn't she care? The Haradas are the owner's family, but all of us here kind of are, too... If you need a hand in Harumi-Cho mac, just say the word!  The smoking cart-puller's  thoughts can be heard... This joker again? A detective from Tsukudo-Cho, is he? It'd be rude to knowingly break a promise, though. The owner of Ryugu is a dab hand with indirect threats. Hopefully that Tsukudo-Cho flatfoot will learn his lesson: you don't want to be in Ryugu's debt.  If the owner of Ryugu finds me loafing here, she'd be torched. Just ten more minutes... In ten more minutes, I'll get back to work! If the owner of Ryugu went to Harumi-Cho, she'd have her hands full for a while... Which means... Ten more minutes! In ten more minutes, I'll get back to work! The owner of Ryugu was always pretty, but she's grown into a real fine Jane. She'll have her work cut out for her, dealing with all the customers who come just to see her! I'm sure she'll be fine taking care of both Ryugu and Harumi-Cho, but... She does tend to mask her true feelings. I hope she doesn't run herself ragged. I'd rather not rely so much on the rickshaws, but what choice do I have? I have an endless supply of income. I can't possibly run out of money! I better go burn off some of these bank notes before my account fills to bursting! Hahahah! A man's worth comes from his position in society. The rich ones are the lucky ones. As long as you've got the dough, like I do, you can drink expensive hooch and get all the best women. Ugh, I can't stand riding in rickshaws. Why do they have to smell so moldy and sweaty? If the waiter at a high-class restaurant knows you by name, you're definitely socially elite. ...No, I guess it doesn't have any  effect on your looks or personality. Why do you ask? The value of a man is his net worth, of course! Why do you keep asking me about looks and personality? What's eating you?  The air-headed woman's thoughts can be heard... To be honest, I can't stand the thought of that oily old piker touching me... But, he's got that air about him so I better bite my tongue. Being an executive's personal secretary is hard. A man couldn't understand... Whatever happens, I can't let my boss down. My life depends on this job! There's no reason to go back to my office at the Daily. Right now we have to beat the bushes. Kasumidai, here I come! Wish I could eat at those first- class joints, but I don't have the time or the dough... Aah, this is no time to be beating my gums. Let's beat feet over to Kasumidai. The entrenchment of trends leads to a society's decline. The word modern itself becomes antiquated--an anathema to the civilization itself. Ginza-Cho is too large for a thorough search. It will waste our time for minimal results. We need concrete data on the whereabouts of the Irie Fudou in order to proceed. Without a doubt, the Irie Fudou is in Ginza-Cho's construction area... Make haste! We haven't much time! Our diets simultaneously ease our hunger and enable our lust for self-aggrandizement. A person's chosen eating habits correlate to his or her socioeconomic status. A learned behavior of extravagance marks the point of no return. Decadence is a symptom after which the doomed will offer their very souls in exchange for clemency. In summation, greed is the defining essence of humanity. Do you not agree?  There is nothing here.  It's a Dragon Cave. Mysterious power is flowing out of it...  Here, Raidou can record his findings without being disturbed.  Save? Yes Recover health? Yes  and his demons were healed. *sob* *sob* ...Who are you? I've never seen you around here... I'm Nakisawame. I heal everyone... *sob* Welcome. *sob* Welcome. It's a full moon, so... Do you want me to heal you? Yes yen... Is that okay? YesThis may sting a little, but only for a moment...   and his demons were healed.   was healed. *sob* Don't die on me... Please... *sob* So... You're going to die, too... You don't have enough money... *sob* So... You'll die just like all the rest...  Leave the area? Yes It's an elevator.  It looks like humans are unable to reach inside and take the contents.  It's a glowing, red crystal.  The contents inside shift and warp. Take the contents? Yes  fished around for the contents... ......   obtained .  It's a glowing, blue crystal. Take the contents? Yes It's empty.  Raidou obtained .  Raidou obtained .   obtained .   obtained .  There's something on the ground. Pick it up?  Raidou obtained .   obtained .   found something. ......  Raidou obtained .   found something. ......  Raidou obtained .  The Shikimi no Kage has been destroyed. The way ahead is clear.  It's a Tainted Gate. A demon should be able to pass through.  Raidou paid  yen worth of streetcar fare and returned to the detective agency.  Raidou returned to the detective agency.  Raidou didn't have  yen for the streetcar fare.  Gouto covered the rest. ......  Raidou didn't have  yen for the streetcar fare.  The rest of the fare was paid out of Gouto's wallet.  Raidou used the  and returned to the detective agency. . It's about time you paid up for all the times I covered your streetcar fare.  Raidou paid Gouto back for all the times he borrowed money to pay his fare.  All the money Gouto lent to Raidou for the streetcar fare was returned to Gouto's wallet.  It's not that easy to escape from here!  There's still more to investigate.  The Mute ailment prevents the use of that ability.   felt it would be best if Raidou were here.   felt the urge to report back to Raidou.   wondered if Raidou should investigate here, too.  That cannot be used here.   began a solo investigation.   reported the findings of the investigation.   talked animatedly about the particulars of the investigation.   reported to Raidou despite its fatigue.   is eager to pick a fight.  The encounter rate went up.   played it hard to get.  The encounter rate went down.  The effects of Provoke wore off.  The effects of Intimidate wore off.  The effects of Repulse Water wore off.  The effects of the Attract Water wore off.  The effects of the Soda wore off.  The effects of the poison wore off.   tried using Ignite.   tried using Cool Down.   tried searching areas with spiritual energy.   scouted around the area.   returned from the scouting mission.  In this area...     ...were spotted lurking around.  ...no demons were spotted.  As for items left in the area...   have been confirmed.   told Raidou he'd have to to find any hidden items himself. ...none were spotted.   also found   while scouting.  Raidou obtained .   tried a good, hard strike.   tried using the art of mind reading.   filled the air with pheromones.   is spacing out.   looked at the human and was surprised.  It's no use!   is reminiscing about its home.  It seems humans are foreign to .   tried hard to make conversation.  Alas, it was invisible to the human.   hung back bashfully.  The human didn't notice.   winked!  The human didn't notice.   attempted intimidation!  But,  ended up as the one being intimidated.   tried singing a song.  Eventually, it got bored and stopped.   tried getting the first strike.  It was a futile effort.   asked for MAG.  Alas, it was invisible to the human.   asked for money.  Alas, it was invisible to the human.   was startled.  The human turned this way as  tried to make conversation.  ...Or so it seemed. In fact, it was just a coincidence; demons are invisible to humans.   bemoaned the rough treatment it received from .  The demon died and returned to the tube...  Raidou decided to come back and try again later.   is trying to demonstrate its expertise...  Watch the demonstration? Yes  recovered full HP thanks to 's magnificent acupuncture techniques.   recovered full MP thanks to 's magnificent acupuncture techniques.   pressed the wrong pressure point.   took major damage!   pressed a miracle pressure point.  's Strength went up by 1.   pressed a miracle pressure point.  's Magic went up by 1.   pressed a miracle pressure point.  's Vitality went up by 1.   pressed a miracle pressure point.  's Luck went up by 1.   pressed the wrong pressure point.   started to feel queasy.   pressed the wrong pressure point.   started to feel queasy.   was moved by its creative instincts.   turned .   looks sad...   was going to demonstrate its expertise...  But, no one was watching.  's mouth watered.  But,  resisted temptation.   tried acting snobby, so as not to be treated with contempt.   succumbed to the pressure and was unable to talk.   had a bad feeling about this.   stared at the voiceless thing.   stared at the voiceless thing.           Welcome, Kuzunoha. I see you have a fair young lady with you today.  Raidou asked Victor about the crystal. ...You wish to find a crystal ball of spiritual power, here in the Capital? Hm...... I have been conducting research in various areas since my arrival in Japan... At one point in my studies, I did come across a document regarding a monk who built the Capital. He placed statues in a number of locations to act as protection for the Capital. These five statues were called the . ...However, the document hinted at a sixth, hidden statue. It did not correspond to a color like the other statues, and was called Mushoku Fudou.  with the power to ward off evil. ...I will admit, the document was quite old. ...I have no way to know if that Fudou is the crystal you're looking for. However, you're welcome to search for it, if you believe it could be. If I remember correctly, the Mushoku Fudou was placed near an inlet. It was cross referenced as the . I do hope I've been of some assistance. Irie Fudou... I suppose that could be it. Let's ask around about it a little more, . Now that we have a name to go off of, it should be easier. What we need is someone who knows about the Capital. ...Time for more legwork, right ? What's going on up there, Kuzunoha? It sounds serious. Ah, you've brought something I need to have a look at?  Raidou showed Victor Tsiolkovski's Equation. Russian, eh? I picked up a little bit during my travels. ...It's a theory on space flight, as far as I can tell. What is it for?  Raidou explained the situation to Victor. I understand; you need this equation so that you can launch your rocket. Though it is possible to launch a rocket using this equation... ...whether or not it reaches the satellite is a different story. You have to account for Earth's rotation, humidity, wind velocity, gravity... speed and altitude... To account for all those elements on top of the launch equation is-- Even I can't do it. I would recommend giving up on this rocket plan and finding an alternative. An alternative? Geez, pops, we're all ears. There has to be some way to handle the calculation, . If only we had more time... Right now I'm working on a humanoid automaton with complex computation capabilities. ...It's like an artificial life form that can out-think human beings. In theory, he would be able to solve your equation--but of course, he would have to exist first. ...Artificial life form? Kind of gives me the heebie jeebies. That reminds me! The Dark Summoner had a weird mechanical body, didn't he? Think he could handle all this mathematical nonsense? ! The more I see, the more amazed I am! I had no idea an android already existed! All right, already! I am meant to impress only the ladies, if you get my meaning. I would prefer to have a nice head on my shoulders, da? I much prefer it this way, as there is no risk of you getting away. Now, Kuzunoha, feel free to ask him whatever you wish. As for you, I'll fix your body as long as you answer everything truthfully. Okay, I understand. You need my brain, da? Show me the report again.  Raidou showed Rasputin the report and explained the situation. I see. You want to destroy the satellite with a rocket. You do realize the scientist's rocket isn't enough, don't you? You can tell just by plugging the numbers into Tsiolkovski's Equation. That rocket has fuel and weight issues. It's not fit for launch. What do we need to adjust before it can work? The power output, first of all. That's the main concern. Something equivalent to a solid core nuclear rocket would be ideal, but... Since that isn't possible in this era... Hm... You might have a chance if you give it multi-stage propulsion to reduce its weight, post-launch. ...Time the launch right, and it should work, in theory. ...Tell this to your scientist: Reduce the rocket's weight as much as possible. Launch it at exactly 15:00, on the dot. This way, it will cross Tai-itsu's orbit at the moment it is precisely overhead. Based on this report, I believe those are your best options. If they do this, will the rocket be able to reach the satellite? Reach it, yes. However, it still isn't enough to destroy it. Aha, it appears there is a control unit inside of the satellite. If you get inside and destroy that unit, it may trigger a larger explosion. Keep in mind that I told you how to launch your rocket. It's not my fault if you can't destroy the satellite. Wait a minute; Rasputin's Russian, isn't he? I don't know why we didn't go to him in the first place. Oh well, at least we have a little bit of hope, now. ! Let's get this information to Dr. Tsukumo right away! I doubt we'll get a second chance to defeat the Soulless God!  There is nothing here.  Leave? Yes......! Arghh...! Grahhhh! Aarrr! Grrrr...  The Red Cape ran away... Don't let it get away! After it! Damn, it ran away again. Quick, after it! You can't escape this way, you big ape! . Look at it. It's just running in circles, trying to throw us off. If we closed the loop with something, we'd have it. I wonder what we could block its path with... All right, we've got it weakened. Just once more and we'll finish it off! Get a wiggle on, ! Things are heating up now! Be careful. When you hear that weird voice it has, you won't be able to move. Stay frosty, . I wish it wouldn't keep trying to run. It's worse than a dog chasing its tail. There's got to be something large we can use to block its path... If you find something, let your demons do the heavy lifting. You'd only throw your back out. I'd do it myself, but I think it'd be more instructional to let you take care of it. . Before you corner it, are you sure you're ready? That enemy has been causing chaos all over the Capital. Don't underestimate it. Use Inspect to chase. Then the following sentences will be displayed.  The demon began the chase by relying on the hard tip of the mushroom!  Red Cape is in Ginza-Cho Main Street...  Enter the battle with Red Cape here.  One of the random encounters in this area will be with Red Cape.  The probability of encoutering the Red Cape is very high.  It's a parked automobile.  It's the latest model of automobile, broken down in the middle of the street.   moved the automobile using brute strength.  The automobile was pushed away.  It's a parked automobile. Hmm, an automobile. This might be just the ticket to block that freak's path. Aha... Here we go, . Get behind the automobile and push. Didn't work, huh? Well, it seemed like a good idea at the time. . Get behind the automobile... Then, let your demon do the heavy lifting. I'm Poltergeist! I'm gonna move this, just you watch! Here I go... Gotta get fired up first... One, two, three... Move! Umm, I think it might be too heavy for me. Maybe a really  could move it? Tch... Awesome! I wanna be as strong as him when I grow up! I'm Poltergeist! Someday when I get bigger, I'm gonna move lots of things to surprise humans. Hey, you! Get away! I'm moving that automobile! Find your own automobile to move! This one's mine! The automobiles in Kurisu-zaka get wrecked sometimes. The Red Cape does it, I heard. He's pretty scary, so I'm just gonna stay here and play with this automobile. Hey! That's not cool! Tch! The automobiles in Kurisu-zaka get wrecked sometimes. The Red Cape does it, I heard. He's pretty scary, so I'm just gonna stay here and play with this automobile. Man... This car is so heavy, I can't even budge it. Tch... Noooo! The monster! Waaah... I'm scared!

Thanks for the fried tofu, Mr. 14th. To pay you back... I'll let you in on something. There're other Training Halls around the Capital. Like this one, they're good places to train yourself and your demons... But, there's a secret to 'em. Every Training Hall has a special item that'll pump you up. If you bring in a sharp-eyed demon, you should be able to spot 'em. Mr. 14th, you're doing great. I'll give you a reward... An invitation to a members-only club made just for guys like you... The ! It's the time-tested training ground for the Kuzunoha clan. There are lots of demons around, so you can find just about any demon you're looking for. If you want to check it out, go to the washstand out in front. The Training Hall is where the Kuzunoha clan goes to shape up. There are lots of demons around, so you can find just about any demon you're looking for. If you want to check it out, go to the washstand out in front. You are a hard worker, Raidou the 14th. I shall bestow upon you a reward... Not material possessions, but beneficial information that will aid you in your journey. Know you the Training Hall? It is the ancient ground where members of the Kuzunoha clan cultivate their strength. Demons abound within its walls, and if you seek a particular demon, you may well find it there. If you wish to enter the Training Hall, examine the washstand in front of the building. You are a hard worker, Raidou the 14th. We Inari statues support the Kuzunoha clan. We are fragments of the Ukanomitama spirit. Should you grow in strength as a Kuzunoha... I shall grant you access to the . Until then, continue to train vigorously. I am honored that you have brought me fried tofu, Raidou the 14th. To show my gratitude... I shall impart helpful information. The Capital is home to other Training Halls. In addition to the normal training you may undergo within their walls... They conceal powerful secrets. Each Training Hall contains a mysterious item that will increase your prowess as a Devil Summoner. Demons with a weather eye may be able to spot them.  The Inari statues speak to you. You are a hard worker, Raidou the 14th. We Inari statues support the Kuzunoha clan. We are fragments of the Ukanomitama spirit. If you are unsure of anything, ask us to clear your mind of doubt. Our role is to provide a Devil Summoner with assistance whenever he may require it. You are a hard worker, Raidou the 14th. Have you a question? How to attack and defendHow to control demonsAbout Combination Skills  button to swing your sword.  Press the  button to fire your gun and halt the enemy for a brief moment.  If the enemy attack cannot be dodged,  button to  defend and reduce damage.  There are several methods of attacking with the blade.   to  execute   Use the directional buttons or left analog stick with the  simultaneously to    to damage the enemies around you with a   Experiment with different combinations of blade techniques and gunfire.  Bullets infused with elemental power can strike the enemy's weakness.  Press the  button to open the main menu, then choose Reload to  select the type of bullets to equip.  The art of confinement allows a Devil Summoner to turn demon enemies into allies.  Enemies will be  by attacks that exploit their weaknesses.  While the demon is immobile,  to confine it into the tube.  If the demon resists, press the  to overcome it.  You may control the demons' fighting style.  Open the battle menu with the R1 button, then choose Command to select a fighting style.  Experiment with different styles for the best results.  When demons level up, they learn Combination Skills.  Combination Skills are stronger than normal attacks.  Breed many demons to learn various Combination Skills.  In battle, a  will be visible in the demon information column on the left side.  This is a gauge of the demon's tension.  When the Morale Icon is full,  can be used.  Press the  simultaneously to use the Combination Skill. There is yet one more thing to explain. Raidou the 14th of another space-time... It seems that something is gravely amiss in your world. Hey, d'you know that doppleganger is a German word? I guess you learn something new every day.  Perform Ritual of Entry to the Dark Realm?  Going to the Dark Realm.

This is an emergency!  Heeding Gouto's call, a figure appeared before Raidou. ...Raidou Kuzunoha the 14th, guardian of the Capital... What is the emergency which brought you here?  Raidou explained the day's events to the Herald of Yatagarasu. ...So a demon has pulled a human into the Dark Realm. I will weaken the protective field around the Capital to open you a path into the . ...The Dark Realm exists only to those aware of its presence. There are dangers there foreign to this mortal world. It is a dwelling place of demons. Be careful, for your life is in great danger there.  The Ritual of Entry begins, and Raidou is sent to ... Raidou Kuzunoha the 14th, I've awaited your return. Please, come this way. Admiral, Kuzunoha has arrived. Ah, yes... Raidou Kuzunoha, the guardian of our Capital. I'm depending on you. Raidou, this man is an important naval officer. He's... crucial to the future of our country.  and is now unable to move. ...I would ask for your help in saving this man. I will perform a Purification Ritual. The Admiral was cursed by an evil thought cast upon him. If we exorcise and purify that thought, the effects should subside. But, we cannot ignore the origin of this curse, Raidou. It will be your job to locate the one responsible and smite him. In order to do so, I would ask you to become a . ...What!? But, Raidou's the one breaking the curse! That is precisely why we cannot transfer it onto a doll. You shall accept the curse placed upon the Admiral as your own burden. In doing so, you will gain the ability to follow those evil thoughts back to their origin.  I accept.You embody the qualities of a true Devil Summoner. So be it. I will begin the Ritual of Purification. Raidou, please prepare for the ritual. The curse is attacking the Admiral. If you break concentration for even a moment, it will tear you apart. Use the utmost care! I have completed the ritual. The Admiral is safe. Now, it is imperative that you find and destroy the source of this curse. Concentrate... Feel the curse. Your body should know what course to take.  Raidou sought the curse and his body melted into thin air. I'm afraid you do not have the option of refusal, Raidou. However, I understand the peril involved in the ritual. I can grant you time to prepare, if you so desire. Please return once you have adequately prepared for the task at hand. The ritual will transfer the curse to a replacement body called the Fuchikoma--a sacrifice. The curse binding the Admiral was placed by a demon. You will need to take his place. Doing so will allow you to follow the curse back to its origin.   You did it, Raidou. The Admiral is safe. I'm glad I have the chance to thank you personally. Still, using demons to curse the Admiral? What a terrifying man. Major General Munakata, I mean. I'm sure you figured it out. This is because of that Super Soldier Project of his... This all happened because he considered the Navy an obstacle. We're safe now, Raidou, but we cannot let Munakata get away with this. I would like to ask for your cooperation in stopping Munakata. The Navy has been using spies, myself included, to monitor his activities. We have reason to believe that if his Super Soldier Project continues, the Capital will be in danger. I've been granted permission to share information, if there's anything you need to know. Once you understand the scope of his project, I believe you'll agree with our assessment.  Ask about MunakataHe's considered a genius in the Army, and rightly so. His flawless strategic decisions earned him the reputation of being able to see the future. But lately, his activities have been... suspicious, to say the least. Building a ship underground... The Special Guard... Demons... He's connected to them all.  Ah, the Super Soldier Project... I was shocked when I heard about it. It's Munakata's plan to beef up defenses and expand the country, but the details... It's creepy. Japan needs an edge over the other world powers, since we lack abundant natural resources... ...Munakata's plan is to create an invincible army of soldiers who cannot die. You've seen them around; they're the Special Guards in red. They're corpses underneath those uniforms. Hence, they do not fear death, and will keep fighting until nothing is left--literally. I would imagine the ship being built underground is to transport this army overseas. He needs an unsinkable ship to transport an unstoppable army. This is something we simply cannot allow to happen. Raising the dead to fight a war? It's disgusting! There are lines that shouldn't be crossed, and Munakata crossed a big one. If this project is seen through, he'll become the most powerful man in the country. We have to do something before that can happen. The Red Cape phenomenon is caused by those radio towers the Army constructed. Waves from the towers affect certain people... causing them to break down. Those people become a kind of walking dead... From their minds, the Hiruko are born. This is all just another facet of the Super Soldier Project. ...Hopefully now you can comprehend the horror Munakata is trying to unleash with his Super Soldiers. We would like to continue monitoring the Army in hopes of stopping Munakata. But, his demons and that undead army make it difficult for a normal human being to get involved. You, on the other hand, are a Devil Summoner. I had hoped you might lend us your services. His army... The underground ship... Those radio towers... ...and that Daidouji girl you're looking for... The Super Soldier Project is the thread tying them together. And, we have to stop it. . There's a tower on the mountain called . It's the first of the Army's radio towers. Sources say Munakata visits that site often, even now. If you can get in there... We may be able to find out what he's planning to do next. Raidou, can I entrust you with this mission? Yes.Thank you, Raidou. Remember, you're up against a man who controls the dead. It's dangerous, but I trust you. I'll make the necessary arrangements with your superior. ...Good luck, Raidou Kuzunoha. ......... Please, Raidou... Think it over. This mission could very well determine the future of Japan. Hm... What magic is this, that there are two Raido Kuzunoha the 14ths? ...I sensed a strange presence and this man appeared. Goto didn't think he was a demon, so we brought him here. ...I see. However, his spiritual essence... I understand. You are a lost soul. You were not meant for this time and place. You are a foreigner; an anomaly. Anomaly? Are we going to have to get rid of them? No, this person is the Raido Kuzunoha the 14th of another space and time. ...That's the case, is it not? Are you Raido Kuzunoha the 14th? Yes.As I thought. ...However, it is detrimental to this world for you to remain here. . Tell her that you're Raidou. Thus, you must return to the space and time from whence you came. To this end, I will permit you use of the . ...What's the Amatsu Kanagi? It is a sacred artifact. By using its power in a ritual, you may be able to return safely to your world of origin. ...However, before that can happen, I do require some effort on your part. The Amatsu Kanagi has been sealed to prevent it falling into evil hands. Earth, flame, water... It was separated into several prisms, each with a guardian. Raido from another world... If you wish to set things right, you must earn three of these prisms. Once you have overcome the guardians and obtained them, I will show you how to return home. ...We've had stranger jobs. Just like Yatagarasu said, . Let's find those prisms. If you are prepared, then choose a destination. Each prism has been hidden in a different location.  Dark SakuradayamaSo be it. I shall send you to Dark Sakuradayama. Godspeed. So be it. I shall send you to Dark Ginza-Cho. Godspeed. So be it. I shall send you to Dark Harumi-Cho. Godspeed. When you believe yourself to be ready, return here. You are ready to seek the prisms, are you not? Deleted! In that case, decide which location you are to search. You have obtained the three prisms of earth, water, and flame. As promised, I shall grant you the Amatsu Kanagi and send you back to your proper world. Relinquish the prisms unto me...  Raidou handed the three prisms to the Herald of Yatagarasu. Very well. When combined with the Heaven Prism which I protect... ...the prisms assume their true form as the Amatsu Kanagi.  The four prisms overlapped, forming a single object.  Raidou obtained the . Come forward, Raido. ...Yes? Accompany this man to the Ushigome-gaeri Bridge. That is the boundary between our world and the Dark Realm, the most ideal location for the ritual. Use the Ritual of Soul-Sending, the technique used to send evil spirits back whence they came. Go forth, Raido, and he of another space and time. I'd be lying if I said I was eager to cross swords with myself. I'm all too aware of what Raido the 14th can do... You couldn't have expected this, but you got your bearings quickly and carried out your duty. I admire that. You're certainly worthy to be called Raido the 14th. ...Hmm, is that too much like self-praise? Hmhm...  There is a bell inside the shrine.  Ring the bell? Yes The bell resounded through the area... I am the Herald of Yatagarasu, the one who vouchsafes the peace of the Capital. Raidou the 14th, Devil Summoner of Kuzunoha, is something amiss? Perform the Ritual of Entry.Very well. I shall send you to the Dark Realm of the Capital. You do not require anything? Then, I shall be on my way back to Yatagarasu. A place not on this plane...  The Herald of Yatagarasu disappeared. So, Raidou the 14th, it seems you have grown in strength since we met. You shall henceforth be known as Raidou the 14th, . You shall henceforth be known as Raidou the 14th, . You shall henceforth be known as Raidou the 14th, . You shall henceforth be known as Raidou the 14th, . You shall henceforth be known as Raidou the 14th, . You shall henceforth be known as Raidou the 14th, . You shall henceforth be known as Raidou the 14th, . You shall henceforth be known as Raidou the 14th, . You shall henceforth be known as Raidou the 14th, . You shall henceforth be known as Raidou the 14th, . You shall henceforth be known as Raidou the 14th, . You shall henceforth be known as Raidou the 14th, . You shall henceforth be known as Raidou the 14th, . You shall henceforth be known as Raidou the 14th, . You shall henceforth be known as Raidou the 14th, . You shall henceforth be known as Raidou the 14th, .  Raidou's title has changed! You may find these of use now.  Raidou obtained 2 Tubes. You may also find this to be valuable... Please put it to good use during your mission.  Raidou obtained the . This mirror will reveal the abilities of hostile demons you face in battle. I'm sure it will prove useful. ...That is all. We are counting on you. I look forward to your growth in your efforts to safeguard the Capital's peace. Raidou the 14th, is there anything else you require of me?  Raidou obtained 4 Tubes.  Raidou obtained 6 Tubes. You look like you have something to say. ...You tricked me.That is simply how events have played out. I won't ask you to let bygones be bygones... But, understand that we aren't the enemy. I swear it upon this crest. Do you mean Mr. Narumi? He looks worse than he is; there's no internal damage. He put up quite a fight. He was able to dodge several of our best men. Our pride was hurt worse than his body... Under urgent circumstances such as these, we believe this is the best possible solution. I'm sorry, but we aren't giving you a choice. Assuming you wish your friend to be unharmed, that is. , so remember it. Most people don't pay much attention to this beat-up old shrine... But, it's actually of great importance to the Kuzunoha clan. This is where we contact our client in the Capital. I was told that Raidou Kuzunoha the 14th would be arriving soon. You are that Devil Summoner, I presume?  who brings tidings from . I am the one who ordered the Kuzunoha clan to maintain peace in our capital city. So, long story short, you want Raidou here to keep watch over the capital city. Yes, the city is currently unstable because so many people have gathered there. The boundary separating this world from the Dark Realm is weak.  will start to appear. There will be serious ramifications if they should attack residents of the city. In order to prevent that from happening, I am calling on you, Raidou Kuzunoha the 14th. , which normal humans are forbidden to enter. You, however, are permitted as a Devil Summoner. You must subdue the demons before they can cause any public harm. Such is the will of Yatagarasu. Do you understand? I will protect the people.I am glad to hear you say that. ...There is one last thing. You may not understand now, but you will once you arrive in the Capital. One last thing... You will have an assistant while in the Capital... . He runs a detective agency--on his own, at the moment. You are to become employed at the  and work as a detective. A detective agency, huh? That's a pretty swanky way to gather information, isn't it? I have already made the proper arrangements with Mr. Narumi. The fate of the Capital rests on your shoulders, Raidou Kuzunoha. Raidou Kuzunoha the 14th. Why have you not yet broken the curse? Your duty is to defeat the demon who placed the curse, and save the Admiral. Enter the Dark Realm quickly and defeat your enemy.  Raidou melts into another realm, pursuing the source of the curse... The Dark Realm lies behind the world we know. It is a place where demons roam freely. The border between the realms is thin, and demons sometimes enter this world by chance. Those who know how to look can see a demon's hand in most of our world's unsolved crimes. I am able to use the Ritual of Entry to connect our world with the Dark Realm.  It's a Dragon Cave. Mysterious power is flowing out of it...  Here, Raidou can record his findings without being disturbed.  Save? Yes Recover health? Yes  and his demons were healed. *sob* *sob* ...Who are you?

The guys there are much better than the pathetic boys at our school. Nothing lasts forever, and the Daidouji bloodline is no exception. With the head of the household as good as gone, that distinguished name has become tarnished. When you think of a rich family's only daughter, you'd assume she would be spoiled, right? Not Kaya. Well-behaved, excellent marks in school, as beautiful as she is witty... she's a golden child. This is the Red-Light District, where even a strong man will be out of breath before long. It's no place for a schoolboy like you, kid. Unless you got Boss's permission, that is. We're planning to turn that factory there into a parking lot for patrons of the Red-Light District. You'll be able to use it by the time it's done, but for now, I don't think you should go in there. Looks like he won't let us through. Well, we don't have any business there anyway, .

WaTcH my dRIftING teChNIquE!  The demon left... 'Sup with that radio tower? It looks pretty dangerous, y'know? I don't think it's up to code. Ain't that radio tower a beaut? The simple ways are the best ways, man. Something like that, you don't need to fancy it up any. What? The radio tower's getup? You going funny in the head? I can't see a single thing wrong with it. A multitude of curious creatures is squirming hither and yon. They seem to be led by a human. Well, they will do as they must. 'Tis not hard to fathom the limits of a human. The human who malformed the radio tower is wreaking havoc in yon direction. Well, needs must as the devil drives. The scale of human endeavors, even those requiring such explosives and combustibles... 'Tis but a single raindrop in the thunderstorm of our lives. The human world hath undergone rapid change of late. The new society is one where the dull and the weak cannot adjust quickly enough to survive... In the meantime, their supposed betters have become greedier, causing more disputes. Humanity is such folly. Feel that, young'un? Those creatures over there are giving out negative waves. Sadness... Melancholy... Despair... All manner o'negative energy is streaming out from that tower, and there's no end to't. Those dad-blasted creatures are gone, but they couldn'ta just up and disappeared. No sirree. It gives me the willies thinkin'a where they might o'gone, or what they might do still. The karma of humans ain't a pretty thing ta see. Feel that, young'un? The negative waves are startin' to build up. I sure hope no one and nothin' out there is plannin' on using that energy. The karma of humans ain't a pretty thing ta see. Oh, my aching shoulders! I blame that radio tower. Those damn Hiruko are poisoning the radio waves. My shoulders were already stiff, and this just makes things worse! They're as hard as a rock! Hey, you! Could you do me a favor? Get rid of all these Hiruko! They're so thick around here, I can't even move! You scratch my back, I scratch yours, right? Great! I knew you'd understand. I'm counting on you!  The jizo seemed to speak...  ......  It's a jizo standing quietly. Yow, my shoulders hurt. Hey, it's you! Nice job! Check out these shoulders. Nice and soft, eh? Eh? Take this as a token of my appreciation.  Raidou obtained  x1. May you be showered in positive radio waves and have a wonderful life, my friend.  The jizo seemed to speak... Whew, these are some good radio waves.  It's an old shrine...  Leave an offering?  How much? 1 yen Raidou prayed for peace in the Capital.  Raidou prayed for Kaya's safety.  Raidou prayed that Narumi wouldn't go deeper into debt.  Raidou prayed for his dream.  Raidou prayed to become a great summoner.  Raidou prayed for the people's peace.  Raidou prayed that no one would ever see what was under his hat.  Raidou prayed to become a better person.  Raidou prayed for the people's happiness.  Raidou decided not to leave an offering. You called? What the...

You're looking for a hint? Well, I'll need some money first. You've gotta grease my palm. One, two, three... Good enough. I'll tell you. All you have to do is get two to the left and one to the right to resonate. Capiche? What!? You what another hint? Okay, so there are three sacred stones on the left, right? Well, start from there. The rest should be a piece of cake. Well, only one stone on the left is reacting, right? Just get that to resonate, aaaand...?  Nothing happened. 100 yenYou called? ...... Call me all you want, but that's all I'm giving you. Well, to tell you the truth... A while back, I tried to steal an offering from the box, and my hand got stuck! So, I died of starvation. The end. ...... Hahahahah! Kidding, kidding! Did you believe any of that? Hahahahahahah!  The sound of the offering echoed uselessly.  Raidou didn't have enough money. Geez louise! If you can't figure it out after this, I'm washing my hands of the whole thing! Get the 1st and 3rd stones on the left to resonate, then send the demon to the right!

I'll wait here. That emblem on your hat is the  crest, right? Golly, the rumors are true. The guys there are much better than the pathetic boys at our school. Huh, I've been running into Yumizuki boys right and left today. Hang on... is that...? Do you have a twin brother out there? Not that I know of.That's odd... I just saw someone who looked exactly like you in Tsukudo-Cho. Well, almost. He seemed like you, but he had a wild look to him. I prefer the one standing in front of me. That other one looked like he might get fresh. Ohh! You're so... bold! It works for you, though. For a moment, it was as if music was playing in the air. Nothing lasts forever, and the Daidouji bloodline is no exception. With the head of the household as good as gone, that distinguished name has become tarnished. When you think of a rich family's only daughter, you'd assume she would be spoiled, right? Not Kaya. Well-behaved, excellent marks in school, as beautiful as she is witty... she's a golden child. I used to see Kaya walking this way all the time together with her friend. The other girl was a kind-looking young lady, with short hair and glasses. Strange that someone would visit the Daidouji Residence at a time like this. Most people who do are looking for a handout, but their finances aren't the best right now... For someone whose birthday is coming up soon, Kaya didn't look very happy. I suppose the family's situation puts a damper on her mood to celebrate. I bumped into Kiyoshi a day or two ago. He dropped his bag, and I saw inside when it landed. It was full of gold, jewels, and antiques. He was probably on his way to pawn them off. I hear he's in a tight spot with his creditors. This is the Red-Light District, where even a strong man will be out of breath before long. It's no place for a schoolboy like you, kid. Unless you got Boss's permission, that is. We're planning to turn that factory there into a parking lot for patrons of the Red-Light District. You'll be able to use it by the time it's done, but for now, I don't think you should go in there. Looks like he won't let us through. Well, we don't have any business there anyway, . We'll let it ride for now. The Kuzunoha #14 originating from Tsukudo-Cho arrived at Ginza Station. Probability is high that he will turn north in front of the station and proceed to .  The girl walked away with the same dead expression... Shin-Sekai, huh? I wonder what the owner's been up to... The Red Cape? Oh, you mean that mysterious man from the papers. He can really zoom around, huh? I wish I could do that. Then I wouldn't hafta buy train tickets. The Red Cape? Oh, you mean that mysterious man from the papers. He can really zoom around, huh? I wish I could do that. Then I wouldn't hafta ride the rickshaws. The Red Cape? Oh, you mean that mysterious man from the papers. He can really zoom around, huh? I wish I could do that. Then I wouldn't hafta carry taxi fare. The Red Cape? Oh, you mean that mysterious man from the papers. He can really zoom around, huh? I wonder who'd win in a race, him or a taxi? The Red Cape? Oh, you mean that mysterious man from the papers. He can really zoom around, huh? He must have some powerful legs. There's a rumor the Red Cape was spotted at Ginza-Cho again. How many places can he be at once? Harumi-Cho, huh? Every time I go there, I feel small. All those battleships make me wonder about Japan's future. H-Hey, don't you think I look like a foreign... Nah, I guess not. With these stubby legs and this long body, I couldn't be anything but Japanese. H-Hey, don't you think I look like a foreign... Nah, I guess not. With these folded eyelids, I couldn't be anything but Japanese. Kasumidai, huh? Every time I go there, it feels so oppressive. You'll see what I mean if you go. Have you seen the way they leave weapons just laying around at Kasumidai? I know they're protecting the Capital, but isn't that a little unnerving? The military brass can't be happy about the Washington Naval Treaty. All the papers said the Kongo and the battleship after that were nearly complete. My friend started going steady recently. He's goofy for her. But, he still lives with his parents, so I don't know how much of a future they have. Is that girl in the Ouran uniform your girlfriend? She's cute, but... Shouldn't you be studying? You are a student, after all... Maybe I should seriously think about getting a girl... N-Not actually do it, I just mean study the process! Th-That naval officer, the one with a mole on his face... He looked so grim as he passed by... Does he even know how to smile? Kssssh... Kssssh... This is the Capital broadcasting station... Kssssh... How do you like my impression of the radio? I was listening to it one day, and it just came to me. The man in the hat who just passed by, isn't he your boss? He looked pretty grim. I guess he's one of those people who never laughs at jokes. I saw a bearded guy walk into the Narumi Detective Agency. Someone ought to go talk to him, in case he's a prospective client. Wh-What was that? That ball of light that just went up? It was so huge and bright... But, I can't help but think it's signaling dark times. I figured I was safe from the monster, since I'm here and it's in Koutou-Ku. But, then I found it can walk, so I guess I'm out of luck either way. A foreigner dressed all in black came up and started talking to me. Do you know any good bars around here? he asked. Ones that serve borscht? I don't even know what borscht is, so I sent him to the soda joint near Ginza-Cho. ...Who would be dumb enough to ask a schoolboy where the bars are? Do I look that old? That foreigner with you was hitting on every dame who walked by. Every last one ignored him. What was he expecting at a time like this? I guess he finally got too fresh and someone slugged him one. Your foreign friend in black... He just came by here, cracking his neck. I wonder where he's off to? Though, looking at that wolfish expression on his face, I could take a guess... They told me not to come here alone because the Red Cape wanders around here. They said he'll drink my blood. But, I know there's no such thing as the Red Cape... They said the Red Cape is dangerous, and they'll arrest me if I come here alone again. They said he'll drink my blood. But, why would someone drink blood? It tastes yucky. They told me not to come here alone because the Red Cape wanders around here. They said he'll drink my blood and sell me to the Red-Light District. They told me not to come here alone because the Red Cape wanders around here. But, I know that's just a lie to scare kids into doing what they say... isn't it? I saw the Red Cape! He's real! He was going to Ginza-Cho! Mama came and yelled at me for disobeying her and coming here alone! Waah! When the Red Cape went to Ginza-Cho, he looked into my eyes... He looked... scared. I thought he was going to cry. My teacher said foreigners have shorter intestines because they eat more bread than rice. That's why their bodies are shorter and their legs are longer. My teacher said foreigners get a lot of protein because they eat mostly meat. That's why they're tall with so many muscles! My teacher said it's tradition for a man to give a woman a ring. It means they love each other very much. My uncle said he's going to quit the military and go home. He was whooping it up like a little kid, cheering I can finally see my family! My uncle said he's going to quit the military and go home. He said that without anything to do in peacetime, a lot of soldiers are deserting. My uncle said he's going to quit the military and go home. Disarmament is good, isn't it, mister? My uncle said the soldiers were really upset about it. Mister, do you have a girlfriend? I'm sure you must. Your face is so beautiful... I bet you've broken a lot of hearts. Aah! That girl with you is your girlfriend, isn't she!? She's your girlfriend, right!? How many have you had now? How many!? Mama told me that playboys are wicked men who make women cry. Mister, are you a playboy? Are you going to make me cry...? C-Curse? Stop saying that! It makes me think of the time I saw that awful Red Cape... I was at home alone the other day, and heard a voice come from nowhere. It turned out to be just the radio, but I was so scared. Soldiers get a good salary and pension... But, I wouldn't date a soldier. He could get stationed somewhere remote, and I'd never see him. Soldiers get a good salary and pension... But, I wouldn't date a soldier. Launching fireworks like this is so immature. A huge red thing fell from the sky! After that, a monster came up from the sea! What's going on!? A creepy man wearing all black was talking to me just now. He said, In 10 more years, you'll be a pretty little devushku. I pretended not to hear and he went into the soda joint. What's a devushku, mister? The man you were with was flirting with all the girls he saw. None of them paid any attention to him. What did he expect at a serious time like this? I saw you had to carry him home after some girl slapped him for being fresh... Just before the monster fell, there was a bright red flash in the sky. I thought for a moment I heard... a cat meowing. They say if you don't put the Red Cape out of your mind in 13 days, you'll die! But, how can I forget it if it's all over the headlines!? They say if you don't put the Red Cape out of your mind in 13 days, you'll die! But, how can I forget it if my friends keep telling me that!? They say if you don't put the Red Cape out of your mind in 13 days, you'll die! I-If I don't pass that on to four other people, I'll be dead by the next full moon! They say if you don't put the Red Cape out of your mind in 13 days, you'll die! I-If I don't pass that on to four other people, I'll be dead by the next full moon! And, I only have two friends, so it's hopeless... The Red Cape is going to kill me! The Red Cape appeared in Ginza-Cho, right? I still haven't forgotten about him, and it's been 13 days... he's going to kill me! I don't get it. I couldn't think of anything but the Red Cape for 13 days, but I'm still here. ...I guess it was one of those friend-of-a-friend stories. The details did seem fuzzy... You look like a hard man, boy. Been in some scrapes, have you? Maybe you better lay low for a while, here in Fukagawa-Cho. Only the Kantou Haguro-gumi is allowed in the Daikoku-Yu, though Satake has other favorites. Satake doesn't do anything halfway, so you can bet the Daikoku-Yu turns a healthy profit. Satake's a mastermind. He's got his fingers in both the Red-Light District and the young punks. He's both kind and strong! He's a man's man! The Red Cape is whackin' people at random, I hear. The Kantou Haguro-gumi ain't like that. They're punks, but they're the people's punks. That Red Cape's pretty crafty, going to Ginza-Cho instead of Fukagawa-Cho. He knows he wouldn't last two minutes in a scrap with real men. The Daidouji Factory is up ahead, to the left. Better hurry, cause pretty soon I'll be directing people to where it used to be, if you get my drift. The police are looking into what happened here. Even I could tell him that: the place is just cursed. Who'd buy a haunted factory? Seems like this factory's got a history of unusual incidents... The president loved this place so much that... Nah, it couldn't be. The police finally gave up and went home. Some kids ducked in there afterward. A coupla little kids went into the Daidouji Factory together. There was an elementary school boy, and a girl who looked a little younger. Nobody owns or even manages that factory now. It's no man's land. A building with no people in it is like an empty stomach... it'll waste away until it dies. That boy left the factory, with the little girl in tow. The girl had tears running down her face... what happened? Those kids who came out of the factory... I saw 'em heading to the station. They're not planning on taking the train, are they? I wonder if those kids who were playing in the factory are all right... With this blasted martial law, I hope for their sakes that they took that train straight home. I wonder if those kids who were playing in the factory are all right... With the monster looming over Koutou-Ku and all, I hope they took that train straight home. I hear the science laboratory's thingamajig is ready for liftoff. Doc sure had a hard time with it. Feels like ever since you helped him out, everything's been going smooth as silk. Caped men, earthquakes, monsters... I used to think the Daidouji Factory was cursed. But, this place is still standing, so I wonder if it's actually blessed with the president's love. Tall, foreign men are so handsome! I'll take anyone, as long as it's a foreigner! Someone, anyone, just look my way... A foreign man finally talked to me the other day! He came off like a real snake, but you know... he was a foreigner! I was so thrilled! A foreign man finally talked to me the other day. He was a bearded guy who seemed really creepy. He got fresh, so I just ignored him. The Army and the Navy don't get along too well. I'm a Navy gal! Hooray for the foreigners at Harumi-Cho! The Army and the Navy don't get along too well. I'm a Navy gal! Kasumidai is so dull. The Army and the Navy don't get along too well. I'm a Navy gal! I'd rather ride in a ship than a car. I've got too much pep for just one girl... I need someone to share my excitement! I'm angling for a tall, muscular, foreign guy! Golly... You're both so slender. It's overwhelming... I've got too much pep for just one girl... I need someone to share my excitement! Amazing Science Laboratory...? Oh, you mean that junkyard in Senju-Ku? You took a girl there!? That's... an unusual date spot. The Navy soldiers all look pale and unsteady. Did the Navy cook serve up some rancid fish...? Waden One? Ohh, that thing! It's a big hit with my classmates. I mean, look at it...! O-Oh! What did I just say? Forgive me, I got a little overexcited... I just saw some Special Guards in red enter Harumi-Cho. Then the whole city went nuts! Wh-What happened!? The red Special Guards went to Harumi-Cho and caused a commotion... Then they launched some weird thing into the sky... It's a little too much excitement! First the Special Guards in red, and now a gigantic monster? The Capital's getting way too exciting! I'm cursed to live in interesting times... You're going to fight that thing? Are you sure that's a good idea? It's definitely dashing of you, but don't get carried away... I wonder if that monster's here to stay. I wish it had gone home with the other one. Nippon men have filthy mind. It so easy get their money. Law no scare me, I have helper. This all thanks to him. Elfman a good man. Thanks to him, I can make living. But... he have filthy mind. More filthy than Nippon men. Heard Elfman is stocky and middle-age man. Look scrawny to me when we meet. Must be busy, no time to eat. Oh, no you don't. Beat it, kid, it's dangerous past this point. The scary men will zap you with radio waves. You don't want that, do you? The brass told me about you. Raidou Kuzunoha, right? Even we hardly know anything about Waden One. We're all counting for you. We don't believe in luck in the Navy, but all the same... Good luck.  The Navy guard snapped a salute and left. Some Army soldiers caught... that... Oh, you know! The Red Cape! The one the Capital Daily goes on about. I saw 'em catch it! They pinned him with a sasumata. A sasumata?Don't you know what a sasumata is? It's a two-pronged, pitchfork-like weapon for catching crooks between its tines. The military might not have made the best impression, but they have to look out for the civilians. Kasumidai was hopping because of that spy scandal, but now it's much quieter. I wonder what's going on in there... Best to let sleeping dogs lie. Oh my, you gave me a scare just now. Did something bad happen to you? You should go home and sleep it off. Oh my, you don't look so well. Are you feeling all right? If I were you, I'd go home and sleep it off. Should I call your parents for you? You're going to Waden One? Oh my, you're going the wrong way. The tower is an Army project, but you have to go through Harumi-Cho to get there. A swarm of Special Guards went toward Koutou-Ku. They must have gone to make up with the Navy over past grudges. What? The Army and Navy are fighting each other? Oh, that's just a sign of how close they are. Even married couples fight like cats and dogs. There's a monster out there, and the Army isn't doing anything! I know the HQ is important to them, but we need protection too! You're going to beat the monster with a rocket? J-Just you and an old man? It's not your job! This is a matter for the military. Why else do we pay our taxes? I heard there's two of them monsters! If they attack at the same time, the Capital is... Although, that would be much better... you know, strategically speaking. Whoever's controlling those things doesn't have a very good head for tactics. You swam all the way here...? Then, why aren't your clothes wet? Anyway, civilians are prohibited from entering here. About face! All hands... advance! Because of the spy incident, we're tightening our security. No one comes in or out. This area is secured. About face! All hands... advance! It seems you've seen the star next to Ursa Major, shining in the northern sky... The shadow of death is upon you. It seems you've yet to see the star next to Ursa Major, shining in the northern sky... We will meet again when the shadow of death falls upon you... I can't believe I was scared of a civilian... That look underneath his derby... He wasn't your average law- abiding citizen, that's for sure. I can't believe I was scared of a civilian... That bearded foreigner's mug... He wasn't your average law- abiding citizen, that's for sure. The weather's so nice, and here I am stuck guarding this dump. Days like this, I just wanna walk down Ginza-Cho with a girl on my arm. The rocket launch is complete. I just want to get this over with. Right now, I just wanna walk down Ginza-Cho with a cute girl beside me. I drew the short straw, so I get stuck guarding Senju-Ku. The guy on patrol got roughed up by the Kantou Haguro-gumi. I hope he's all right. We're under martial law. I feel sorry for my comrade in town, but... I'm thanking my lucky stars I wasn't assigned to Fukagawa-Cho! Th-Those Zero Division guys... That's going too far! No matter what we think of the Navy... I... I just sat here! I didn't do anything! It's not my fault! No one's gonna come out here. Frankly, it's a waste of time. I thought so, anyway, but here you are. Well, whatever, as long as you don't make any trouble. Hey! A wiseguy, eh? Poking around the Capital looking for out-of-the-way secrets? Well... that's fine. You don't get in my way and I won't get in yours. I heard the voice of Inari at the shrine. Really, I did! If you treat Inari like just a statue, the heavens will punish you for your disrespect. That mountain o' junk ish a mountain o' treasure. Not everyone is shmart enough ta know. Keep yer eyesh wide open... Jusht like a real inveshtigator... Whoopsie, I shouldn'ta let that shlip. There'll be lessh here fer me ta claim. Run... Anywhere... Just hurry... and get... far from... here... I'll... hold it... back... D-Don't... come near... Harumi... Cho... See that brownish building to the northeast? It's another radio tower. They're building five radio towers in all. Waden One is just the first. See that brown building all the way to the left, by the corner? That's another radio tower. They're built to surround the Capital for the best reception. Thanks to them, I can listen to the horse races wherever I go. You see that brown tower on the right? Don't let its size fool you; that's a radio tower. It can't beat Waden One, though. That one's the biggest, and I love the way it looks. See that brown building on your left? That's a bona fide radio tower. Y'know that Iroha song they teach kids? They were originally gonna name the towers after the letters in that song. One, Two, and Three were gonna be I, Ro, and Ha. For some reason, though, it didn't fly.  It's a Dragon Cave. Mysterious power is flowing out of it...  Here, Raidou can record his findings without being disturbed.  Save? Yes Recover health? Yes  and his demons were healed. *sob* *sob* ...Who are you? I've never seen you around here... I'm Nakisawame. I heal everyone... *sob* Welcome. *sob* Welcome. It's a full moon, so... Do you want me to heal you? Yes yen...

You'll die just like all the rest...  Leave the area? Yes It's an elevator.  It looks like humans are unable to reach inside and take the contents.  It's a glowing, red crystal.  The contents inside shift and warp.

The way ahead is clear.  It's a Tainted Gate. A demon should be able to pass through.  Raidou paid  yen worth of streetcar fare and returned to the detective agency.  Raidou returned to the detective agency.  Raidou didn't have  yen for the streetcar fare.  Gouto covered the rest. ......  Raidou didn't have  yen for the streetcar fare.  The rest of the fare was paid out of Gouto's wallet.  Raidou used the  and returned to the detective agency. . It's about time you paid up for all the times I covered your streetcar fare.  Raidou paid Gouto back for all the times he borrowed money to pay his fare.  All the money Gouto lent to Raidou for the streetcar fare was returned to Gouto's wallet.  It's not that easy to escape from here!  There's still more to investigate.  The Mute ailment prevents the use of that ability.   felt it would be best if Raidou were here.   felt the urge to report back to Raidou.   wondered if Raidou should investigate here, too.  That cannot be used here.   began a solo investigation.   reported the findings of the investigation.   talked animatedly about the particulars of the investigation.   reported to Raidou despite its fatigue.   is eager to pick a fight.  The encounter rate went up.   played it hard to get.  The encounter rate went down.  The effects of Provoke wore off.  The effects of Intimidate wore off.  The effects of Repulse Water wore off.  The effects of the Attract Water wore off.  The effects of the Soda wore off.  The effects of the poison wore off.   tried using Ignite.   tried using Cool Down.   tried searching areas with spiritual energy.   scouted around the area.   returned from the scouting mission.  In this area...     ...were spotted lurking around.  ...no demons were spotted.  As for items left in the area...   have been confirmed.   told Raidou he'd have to to find any hidden items himself. ...none were spotted.   also found   while scouting.  Raidou obtained .   tried a good, hard strike.   tried using the art of mind reading.   filled the air with pheromones.   is spacing out.   looked at the human and was surprised.  It's no use!   is reminiscing about its home.  It seems humans are foreign to .   tried hard to make conversation.  Alas, it was invisible to the human.   hung back bashfully.  The human didn't notice.   winked!  The human didn't notice.   attempted intimidation!  But,  ended up as the one being intimidated.   tried singing a song.  Eventually, it got bored and stopped.   tried getting the first strike.  It was a futile effort.   asked for MAG.  Alas, it was invisible to the human.   asked for money.  Alas, it was invisible to the human.   was startled.  The human turned this way as  tried to make conversation.  ...Or so it seemed. In fact, it was just a coincidence; demons are invisible to humans.   bemoaned the rough treatment it received from .  The demon died and returned to the tube...  Raidou decided to come back and try again later.   is trying to demonstrate its expertise...  Watch the demonstration? Yes  recovered full HP thanks to 's magnificent acupuncture techniques.   recovered full MP thanks to 's magnificent acupuncture techniques.   pressed the wrong pressure point.   took major damage!   pressed a miracle pressure point.  's Strength went up by 1.   pressed a miracle pressure point.  's Magic went up by 1.   pressed a miracle pressure point.  's Vitality went up by 1.   pressed a miracle pressure point.  's Luck went up by 1.   pressed the wrong pressure point.   started to feel queasy.   pressed the wrong pressure point.   started to feel queasy.   was moved by its creative instincts.   turned .   looks sad...   was going to demonstrate its expertise...  But, no one was watching.  's mouth watered.  But,  resisted temptation.   tried acting snobby, so as not to be treated with contempt.   succumbed to the pressure and was unable to talk.   had a bad feeling about this.   stared at the voiceless thing.   stared at the voiceless thing. Testing, testing, 1 2 3. Yes There's something on the ground. Pick it up? Pick it up Raidou obtained .   obtained .  There's no one here.  There's no one here right now...  The Soulless God caused an earthquake!  It's a pier.  Summon the Large Tarrasque? Yes Raidou blew the Flute of Rhone. ? If you don't have a plan first, it's all just wasted effort. First, figure out where the Daidouji Residence isask the average joes around here. , I just saw a flash over there. Let's check it out. A good detective always remembers to search the scene of the crime.  Something is on the ground.  Pick it up?  Raidou obtained a  x1.  Raidou left.  It's the Soba Restaurant, Isakaya.  There is a notice posted on the front door. We're closed today. We'll also be closed tomorrow, and the day after that, too...   It's the Soba Restaurant, Isakaya.  There is a notice posted on the front door.  ......  But,  couldn't read the writing. Welcome to Tawara-Ya.  Tawara-Ya's Special, Sukiyaki Raidou took a bite of the house special.  Raidou's taste buds nearly melted!  Raidou tried a bit of the omlette rice.  The dish was bursting with a taste suitable for refined palates.  Raidou tried a bite of the popular regional dish.  The rice seasoned with the sauce set Raidou's taste buds on fire! ...You know, I used to have a pet turtle. He was pretty cute, and had a fondness for the hard stuff. He died a few years back, so I gave him a little turtle funeral. I wonder how he's doing in the next life...  Raidou left.  It's the Western-style Restaurant, Tawara-Ya.  The scent of butter is drifting out from the kitchen.  The shopkeeper is still in conversation...  It's the Western-style Restaurant Tawara-Ya.   smelled the scent of butter and used up some MAG... Or at least, it felt like it. I wonder how Natsume's doing over there... She eats quite a bit for such a refined girl. She was one of my best customers...  It's Tsukudo-Cho Assembly Hall.  There's a session in progress right now. Yes A mysterious voice can be heard in the building's hallways... *click* *clack* *click* *clack* Pin hoooo! Welcome to the House of Pinfu! Oh... you're a schoolboy. Well, we usually don't let high school students in, but... That's a striking black coat, so... Step right this way, please!  Raidou was led to a table inside.  Originally, Raidou was supposed to be able to play mahjongg here...  Raidou left.  It's Tsukudo-Cho Assembly Hall.   is nodding along with the people inside. We're purdy well-known 'round these parts. A scrawny rent like you couldn't beat us even if we let you win. Yer just another rube for us to fleece for all he's worth. Pin hoooo! Welcome! One, please.Hmmm. Sorry to break it to you, but we're all sold out. Can you come back some other time? Hmmm... Aha! Coming right up!  Raidou obtained  x1.  Raidou left.  It's an old-fashioned tofu shop.  There is a notice posted on the front door. Due to illness, the shop will be closed for the rest of the day. Thank you for visiting.  It's an old-fashioned-tofu shop.   wonders about the fried tofu made inside.  Take out a Fried Tofu?   obtained  x1.   left.   began to count all the soybeans in the store... ...but in the end, there were too many to count.  It's Fujiko Parlor.  It's packed with girls eating sweets.  It's Fujiko Parlor.   looks covetously at the ice cream all the girls are eating.  What should  do? Steal it The demon couldn't resist any longer and took a bite of the ice cream! What the--? Part of my ice cream is gone! It's all sticky, too!   helped itself to the rest of the ice cream. I don't believe this! Now it's all disappeared! What gives? This isn't supposed to happen!   obtained .   left.   is intimidated by all the screaming and giggling, and remains at a distance.  It's a modern-day glass shop.   saw its reflection in the glass and dropped into a combat stance.  It's a modern-day glass shop.  The shopkeeper is working cheerfully, the light glinting off his glasses.  It's the ice shop.  A girl inside is cutting ice with a sharp saw.  It's the ice shop.   rocks back and forth along with the movement of the saw. Hee-ahhh, it feels ho good. This store-ho's a chilly paradise, hee ho. Welcome to our old-fashioned sweet shop, Kugizen. See anything you like? Zenzai Raidou took a bite of the zenzai.  It melted in his mouth, not in his hand.  Raidou sucked on the kuzukiri...  Raidou experienced the subtle taste enjoyed by candy connoisseurs.  Raidou chomped on some shiratama anmitsu...  Raidou became addicted to its mellow sweetness. There are a lot of girls here, but we serve plenty of men, too. Feel free to stop by whenever you want. Goodness, does your little kitty want to try some of our sweets?  Raidou left. ...... Well... If she's offering, who am I to say no?  It's the old-fashioned sweet shop, Kugizen.  A female clerk inside is discreetly stuffing herself with the shop's product.  It's the old-fashioned sweet shop, Kugizen.   is fascinated by the syrup.  Take some? Yes  obtained .   left.   is pushing aside the shop curtain. I keep losing customers to that dessert parlor across the street. I won't let them beat me, though. I'm working on even richer and sweeter candies!  The shop ower is doing research. A cold, delicious sweet, that won't lose to ice cream... Hrmmm...  There is nothing here.  Leave? Yes Raidou left.  Raidou heard a scream.  It's Tamonten.  There's a fortune dispenser. Pull out a fortune?  Raidou said a quick prayer and pulled out a fortune.  Originally, his fortune was meant to be random.  Raidou left.  The fortune reads Great Blessing.  Raidou became so happy, he began trembling with joy!  Raidou feels the gods are blessing him. The fortune reads Moderate Blessing.  Raidou is filled with happiness.  The fortune reads Small  Blessing.  Raidou feels mildly content.  The fortune reads Bad Luck.  Raidou braced himself for the worst.  The fortune reads Catastrophic Luck.  Raidou felt the presence of a terrifying demon...   rekindled the shop owner's spirit.  The shop owner began cutting ice at an incredibly fast pace.   calmed the shop owner down.  The shop owner became lost in thought and stopped sawing ice.   tried agitating the shop owner.  The shop owner got so angry, he began smashing the ice.  The shop owner saw his own reflection in the ice and couldn't stop laughing.  The shop owner starts hugging the ice and sobbing.  He seems to be overcome with remembrance of things past...  The shop owner smiles cheerfully while cutting the ice.   became attuned to the shop owner's inner voice.  The shop owner is thinking about the increasingly popular ice cream.  He has a burning desire to try some.   searched the shop.  There is a bottle of syrup in the corner.   gets a craving for some shaved ice.   tried charming the shop owner.  The shop owner's face turned red and he began to fidget.   spewed flame at the tofu! Hmm? Is something burning? That's odd... We don't make fried tofu here.   blew a chill wind into the store. Phew, it's pretty cold in here. That's odd... We don't make iced tofu here.   tried making the earth shake. Wh-Whoa! The ground is shaking! Is this an earthquake!? I've gotta evacuate--no! First, I have to extinguish those fires!  became attuned to the inner voice.  I'm bored... Maybe I'll take a nap.  ......  The shop owner is asleep. Wake him up? Yikes! Ahehem, welco... huh? That's strange. No one's here... I could have sworn that someone tapped my shoulder... hmm?  snuck away.   searched the shop.  There are tofu skins drying in  the back.   touched them and jumped back when they broke.  tried charming the  shopkeeper! I feel strange... Wh-What are these naughty thoughts popping into my head...? ! I... I can hardly stand up.... First, we need to get our bearings. Let's talk to Narumi about it.  . We've just gone through a dimensional rift. This looks like Tsukudo-Cho, but something feels fishy... return to the detective agency first and get our bearings. . That cat's been eating me. Let's go after that cat. It ran off towards . . There's nothing we need to do at the Daidouji Residence right now.  The door to the Narumi Detective Agency is locked.  The nameplate bears an unfamiliar name... Torimi Detective Agency , I think we hit a bump somewhere in space-time... We've stepped into a world just a little off from what we know. But, this place is still a variation of our own home... Even if we do get back to our time, what we do here might affect things. , don't take any wooden nickels while you're here. . We're being blocked from leaving the city just now. Nothing to do but put up with it and gather information in the city limits. , why don't I take the time to review the art of confinement The art of confinement is a method of making allies of the demons you meet in battle. That's right: they can join you. A demon isn't necessarily an enemy. To perform the art of confinement, first you must render the enemy immobile. To do that, just summon a demon that can exploit your target's weakness. Once the target is immobile, run up to it and rapidly press the . Your chance of success depends on the target's remaining HP and the phase of the moon, so be careful. Remember also that there are some demons you can't confine no matter what, like Zombies. Get it? All right, then try it in battle. Okay, I'll go over it again.  It's an automatic-switch public telephone.  They've been popping up all over the Capital in the last few years.  The telephone is ringing. Wh-What's this dad-blasted feeling of apprehension!? I'd better answer that phone... Nothing good ever came from ignoring a call.  Belial answered the phone. Hello...? Hello? It's me... Land sakes, that voice! Oh, my stars and garters... Uncle! It's you! I'm in Hell right now, but I'm thinking about visiting the Capital. I'm gonna see the ocean as soon as I get there! I'll call you again soon, Uncle. Bye-bye!  The other party hung up...  There's nothing to see here.  The store is closed. It hardly seems like the same shop that was so busy not long ago...  The building is empty, save for an eerie silence.  It's the Soba Restaurant, Isakaya.  There is a notice posted on the front door. We are closed today due to the state of emergency in the Capital.  It's the Western-style Restaurant, Tawara-Ya.  The shopkeeper is entertaining the guests with a cooking  demonstration.  It's Fujiko Parlor.  Few customers are inside, but the employees are still hard at work.  It's an old-fashioned tofu shop.  There is a notice posted on the front door. We will be closed for some time due to the state of emergency.  It's the old-fashioned sweet shop, Kugizen.  The employees inside are hard at work in anticipation of the reopening.  Raidou blew the Flute of Rhone.  But, the Large Tarrasque didn't appear... Okay... I think we escaped the soul-crushing void, but this... ...is the statue at Ushigome-gaeri Bridge, isn't it? This looks like Tsukudo-Cho, but something doesn't feel quite right. Let's make our way back to the detective agency. Stay alert. ...Handsome cat. ! That's no ordinary feline! Something fishy's going on here... Let's tail 'em!  The black cat ran off toward the Tamonten Shrine. Not our shadows? ...I will trust your judgement. But, the question remains... Who are you? Answer me! Why have you assumed the form of Raido Kuzunoha the 14th? I am Raidou Kuzunoha the 14th.They're lying, Goto... Why would he declare my name? Hold on... Can you feel that? I don't believe he's being false. Still, we cannot know for certain on our own. Let us consult with the Yatagarasu and her powers of judgement. ...You're right, of course. If you have nothing to conceal, then come along with us. I don't think we have a choice, ... Let's go with 'em until we can figure out what's going on. They seem reticent. Goto, what should we do? I just can't shake it... I don't believe them to be demons. Well, that certainly wasted a lot of valuable time and effort, but at least we're back-- ? Where is everyone? Why's it so quiet? This has to be the right place-- the Amatsu Kanagi wouldn't have made a mistake. Head for the detective agency. Narumi should be able to fill us in. The Amatsu Kanagi is a sacred artifact which is powered by people's emotions. The rocket scientist, the reporter, and the yakuza boss... Gather the emotional strength of these people whom you established a connection with. With their help, you can follow after the girl!  The voice faded away. , the Ritual of Soul- Sending cannot be performed in the mortal world. Go to Ushigome-gaeri Bridge in the Dark Realm.  The voice faded away. Well hello, Raidou dear. Is something the matter with Mr. Narumi? He said, I have ways to make rent. I hope he doesn't resort to anything criminal... I learned my numbers today! I'm I'm one, two, three, four, five years old, sooo... That means this is Taisho year 20! I heard mommy say she wishes I was never born. Mommy's a hag! ...... Show her the photo of Kaya...And you are? Why do you want to find her? Explain who you areRaidou...? You work at the Narumi Detective Agency? In that case, I need to have a talk with you. C'mon, let's talk somewhere less public... Kyaaaaaahhhh!  She vanished. , but who? ...And why? ...It'll have to wait, huh? !   can now be reached on the Main Map.  You may now enter . ...... ...... I'm... Where am I...? What... just happened? Look at her suspiciously...... ...C'mon... Wh-What do you want? *gasp* You're that detective from before! ...You saved me? Thank you. I... I'm . Kaya is one of my classmates at Ouran High. Can you help Kaya... just like you helped me? ...Okay, I'll level with you. ...But, you have to promise to help Kaya for me. She was really balled up about her bloodline. Have you heard the rumors about the Daidouji family? Supposedly, when girls in her family turn 16, a demon possesses them until they're killed. There's no way something like that could actually happen, but it sure was eating at Kaya. There's this weird song she always talked about, something like... The way of the earth, between father and mother. The way of blood will return to the demon. In the depths of the abyss, the demon's blood must be slain... Pretty creepy stuff, right? She said they passed that tune from generation to generation. When I asked her to explain it, she just smiled at me with a pained look on her face. ...I think she wanted to tell me something, but couldn't bring herself to do it. I've... been thinking about it a lot lately. What if she really is imprisoned somewhere right now? I know that mansion of hers has a basement... ...That's kind of like an abyss, isn't it? I tried snooping around there before, but that butler was keeping an eye on me, so...  or Kaya. But, I'm sure you're a much better detective than I am. You... You just have to help her. Please...  Rin walked off, wiping her tears. Depths of the abyss, huh? ...Think that's where the Daidouji dame is? Not that we have much choice; it's our only lead at the moment. Let's get our wiggle on, . ...The last time I saw Kaya, she told me about the Narumi Detective Agency. And, she gave me this. ...I think she was trying to tell me something. She's trying to handle everything on her own, like always... Raidou, sir... You have to save Kaya! Please!  Raidou obtained an . Kaya, you dolt... ...It's pretty outdated. This isn't something you can use just anywhere. If Kaya gave this key to someone outside her family... maybe she can't trust her relatives? (Player name), let's find out  what this key is for. . If I go inside, you know they'll kill me. You go. I'll wait here. We're drawing a total blank on this crystal. I don't even know where to start. Though, the owner of Konnou-Ya is always handy in a pinch. He knew about that camera, right? How different could a powerful artifact be, really? ...? Demons are all over this place. Regardless of other factors, demons always band together to search for food. ...And I'm afraid you whet their appetites. Magnetite is supposed to be a delicacy, and devil summoners have it. Raidou's are supposed to be pretty hard-boiled. Don't let me down, . Hey you... Over there... Yeah, come over here... I guess he means us. ...Who is that guy? Oh, Raidou, it's you. Sorry about that. I thought you were someone else. ... I should've known. If he's involved, you can bet something's about to go wrong. Move along, Raidou. I have no business with you. Look, I'm on a stakeout, okay? I'm busy. ...I knew he'd slip up sooner or later, but actually kidnap-- ...Uh... *chuckle* Why, Raidou... It's fancy meeting you here, isn't it? *innocent whistle* Do I even have to point out that he's hiding something? I don't mean to imply he's a dishonest cop, but if the shoe fits... You think we should teach this piker a lesson, ? ...Devil Summoner style, of course.  Open the menu by pressing the R1 button and   That demon's  will then become available.  Approach Detective Kazama after you summon your demon. Isn't that...? Wh-What are you talking about? Shouldn't you think this over? It's all true. ...I didn't want to believe it either, but... ...I just wanted you to know. Don't talk like that! It's like you're saying goodbye. Who cares about some demon? We're friends forever, right? When you turn 16, we'll go celebrate, okay? Two regular live wires-- My uncle is waiting for me. I'd better get back... Thanks... for everything. Oohhh... stubborn! That didn't answer anything.  The schoolgirls left. Those two birds were... But then, that had to already have... Wait!

Hee-that! It's what I'm looking ho!  With that, I'd be a Raidou too, hee ho! Now hee-hand it ho-ver!  Jack Frost took the .  Voices can be heard from the Gouma-Den... Hee-so, you fuse me with this, and then... ...Ooh!  Very interesting indeed! But, will I be hee-cool like Rai-- Shut up! Get in there! ...You're cold, ho. Sorry to hee-keep you waiting, ho! Hee... huh? I don't remember you being this uncool, ho... Hee-oh, of course! I'm too cool for you now, hee ho! I'm not da' same weak li'l Jack Frost no more, ho. Now I'm... Ummm... Ah! Now I'm hee-Raiho! But you're just plain old Raid'oh, ho! Cooler is better, hee ho! I'm way cool now, so hee-watch ho-self! What's my hee-name? Say it, ho! You better get it right or we'll hee-have it out! Say the right name or we rumble, ho! Raiho...Well, right, but... Aww, you hee-had to go and spoil my fun, hee ho... Woo-ho! That's what I was hoping to hear-ho! One-on-one duels aren't much fun in this game, don't you think, ho? Hee-so I brought some friends! Prepare to be-ho an ice sculpture, hee! Hee hee ho... You don't get the hee-joke, ho! That game wasn't released here, hee ho! What a bummer. I can't even get angry now, ho... Ho well! You missed your one chance to fight me, ho! Before I hee-disappear forever, I'll delete your save data! Hee ho! ...Just kidding! Hee hee ho! I'll never go away, hee ho! And, I wouldn't delete your save, no... ...That's enough hee-ing the fourth ho. You're so strong, Raidou! I didn't stand a chance, hee ho... I got a little hotheaded, hee... I'm ho uncool... And now, while you're feeling bad for me...! Kidding-ho! I wouldn't trick you like that, hee ho. I'll surpass you one hee, ho! My hee-dream is to become the 15th Raiho! On the day I defeat you, I'll take these hee's back. But for now, here-ho you go!  Raidou obtained the . I'm sorry I was rude, ho. *sniff* ...Please don't hee-hate me.  Raiho left...  Raiho can now be fused at the Gouma-Den. Mommy! Mommy, buy me a Chakra Chip! We'll get one on the way home, dear. No! I want one now! Buyitbuyitbuyitbuyitbuyit! Now dear, the Red Cape snatches away children who don't listen to their mothers. ...But MO-OM! Mommy, are there a lot of  people in Konnou-Ya? Sweetie, what are you saying? The only one here is the owner. But I just saw him talking to the ground! ...Just pretend you didn't see it, honey. It's not polite to  make fun of people with problems. My friend said the Special Guard is at the Daidouji's... Are they going to fight!? Of course not, darling. The military is there to protect civilians. ...At least on the surface. Mommy, the Red Cape isn't real, right? There's no such thing, right? It's a lie, right? Right, mommy? Mommy doesn't know either. She's never seen him. ...Maybe we'll see him today, though. Anything's possible. Waah! Mommy, I'm thirsty! I wanna go to the soda joint! We're not going to Ginza-Cho today, sweetie. No! I wanna sody pop!  IwannaIwannaIwannaIwanna! ...I read in the paper today that the Red Cape was seen at Ginza-Cho. Waah! Mommy! Can we ride the rickshaw? Pleeeeeease? Dear, we have taxis for that now. But I want a rickshaw ride! It's like a... Girl with... nothing on her back? ...Where on earth did you hear that? ...... Mommy, I wanna take a bath! Wonderful, darling! It's a bit early, but we can go home now. No, no! In the red-light area! They're lots of fun with bubbles, right? That's what Daddy said! Watch your mouth! That's embarassing! ...? I wanna be a rickshaw runner, Mommy! Buy me one so I can practice! If you want to drive something, why not a taxi? You won't be in business very long as a rickshaw runner. ...? ...Sweetie? If Mommy and Daddy got in a fight, who would you  love best? I love you, Mommy! ...Really? Even if your new Mommy was prettier and younger? I don't want a new Mommy! You're my Mommy! ...I know. I'm sorry to bring it up, dear. ...Darling, I have something to tell you. I know this is difficult, but please listen to Mommy. You're not really my son. Whaa...!? Your real Mommy lives far, far away, across the ocean. What do you mean!? That's a lie! I won't believe it, I won't! Oh, sweetie, I'm just kidding. You're all mine. I'm positive, because I'd never forget that breech birth... ...... Dear, are you still angry over Mommy's little joke? ...I hate Mommy. ...... Hey! Let's go to Harumi-Cho to watch the ships! Really, can we!? Yay! I love you, Mommy! Look Mommy, boats!  Boats!  We're going to Harumi-Cho, right? It's dangerous right now, honey. We'll go there next time, okay? When's next time? ...Next time. Mommy, that man over there has a gun!  I saw it tucked in his jacket. It's probably just a toy, dear. He's one of those freaks. I found a funny box at Konnou-Ya, Mommy. But they yelled at me when I tried to touch it. They said It's reserved. ...So that place does have customers. Well, the owner is pretty shady, so I'm sure the customers are shady, too. I found a funny box at Konnou-Ya, Mommy. The owner man said it's full of bullets, and I shouldn't touch it, cause it's dangerous. Now dear, a shop right out in the open like that wouldn't have such dangerous things. The man was just joking with you. Hey, that's the lady in the picture! She was in the newspaper. Daddy says her face is ill-fated. What does that mean, Mommy? Oh, the missing girl? I'm sure it wasn't her. If we could find her so easily, she wouldn't be missing. But I saw her! I saw her! She had different hair, but her face was  just like the picture! Now you're interested in young girls? ...You're just like him. Mom? That lady makes scary faces,  just like a man. That's called boyish, dear. It's a popular fad right now. Look, see how she's wearing a skirt? Only women wear skirts, sweetie. Nuh-uh, men wear skirts too. Daddy said they do it at Fukagawa-Cho. Mom, the man at the detective place is a Navy officer, right? What are they doing? Playing war? Of course they are. Playing. I wanna Chakra Chip! Come on, Mommy, buy it! On the way home, dear. No, now! You always say later! You're lying! I won't fall for that! Oh my... I'm happy he's getting  smarter, but that makes it harder to parent him... I wanna Chakra Chip! Come on Mommy, buy it! On the way home, dear. Really!? Yaaay! Don't forget, okay Mommy? Oh my... I'm happy he's trusting, but he shouldn't be so gullible. Naive men don't go far. Why is that soldier grinning,  Mommy? Don't stare, dear! You don't know what he'll do if you make eye contact. Mommy, what was that thing that flew into the air? Does the soldier know? Of course he does, honey. After all, they're the ones responsible. Mom, is Harumi-Cho in danger? It said that on the front page of the Capital Daily. Shouldn't the soldiers be helping? ...Honestly. Even children know they should be protecting the civilians... Mommy! Did you see that man who went into Konnou-Ya? He was all cross-eyed, and electricity was coming out of his head! ...I know the feeling. Who wouldn't want to get drunk at a time like this? Why is that soldier panicking, Mommy? There's no more monsters to worry about. ...Come to think of it, they're caught between the civilians and the military brass. I almost feel sorry for them. I'm cold. It got cold real fast, Mommy! It IS pretty cold today. We'll have stew tonight, okay, sweetie? Yaaay! Mommy! Mommy, buy me a Chakra Chip! We'll get one on the way home, dearie. No! I want one now! Buyitbuyitbuyitbuyitbuyit! Now dear, the Red Cape snatches away children who don't listen to their mothers. Waah! Those girls over there in the magenta uniforms are from Ouran High. I'd like to get inside their heads.  I wonder what they think of me... Say, wasn't Daidouji's daughter going to Ouran High too? That short-haired girl with the glasses in front of the parlor was from Ouran High too, huh. About that short-haired girl from Ouran High in front of the parlor... She looked depressed. I'd bet she just had a bad breakup. Geez, those soldiers have it rough, they gotta accompany their boss wherever he goes. Which I wouldn't mind doing so much if the boss was a young girl. ...It wouldn't be so bad if they were headed to the Red-Light District. So that's a high school girl's diary, eh? Hmm... Hmm... Is that so? I bet it's full of delicious gossip that'd make the reader blush. This Red Cape guy, what's under his cape? I prefer skirts to capes. I prefer nice gams under 'em, too. Nowadays girls want to be modern and bob their hair. How cruel the flow of time! I'm still stuck on long hair! An innocent schoolgirl is good, but women in the prime of their lives are also appealing. ...Like the owner of Ryugu. The nape of her neck--OhhhHhh... Becoming a rickshaw runner is a man's dream; starting a life with nothing on your back. ...Though I'd prefer a woman on her back with nothing on. The Red-Light District isn't my thing... It feels like I'm just another customer. Sure, there's a time limit, but women aren't supposed to just take it all off! The process of undressing a woman should be savored! You know what I'm saying, right? Women shouldn't be chasing men; men should chase after the woman they're stuck on. That's life. You hafta be reckless while you're still young. Chase, chase, and  chase s'more! Why don't the young girls today wear kimonos? Kimonos are traditional! The leg subtly exposed by a slit... And, well, the legs are pretty much the main draw. If you're going to Harumi-Cho, be careful! Look out for foreign women! They should require a permit for those things... Like big, supple, deadly weapons! It's hard... I like rice, but bread is good too! I wear kimonos, but western clothes are comfortable! ...How could I ever hope to choose between local and foreign girls? Kasumidai has no women! None! Nada! The younger soldiers must have it tough... I wouldn't be able to take it! Hey, what are you doing pointing that camera at a guy like me!? Can't you think of anything better to take pictures of!? You came back, leaving an  unconscious woman behind? How could you! If you don't take every opportunity, you're scarcely a man! The gods will punish you. I'LL punish you! Wh-What was that? Major General Munakata was with a civilian schoolgirl? I guess age really doesn't matter... if you have fame, wealth, or a military rank. So lucky! H-Hey! Who was that? Who was the girl you were carrying? She was quite the looker! No fair, why do you have all the luck? Hey, you there... Who's that modern-looking schoolgirl? She sure is a doll. What do you got that I don't got? If you die, I'll die too! But if I go first, stay strong for me! ...Did you like that? I hear that line scores every time. If you die, I'll die too! But if I go first, stay strong for me! Augh, why couldn't I say it? I'm such a wimp! If you die, I'll die too! But if I go first, stay strong for me! T-Today's the day! Yes... I'll say it to that girl right over there! The soldiers are stopping people who want to enter or leave town. ...I wanted to go to the Red-Light District today! What the hell is the Army thinking, launching that huge thing!? I was going to the Red-Light District, but got scared. The whole Capital's in a panic cause of the Harumi-Cho monster. ...That makes this a perfect time to visit the Red-Light District, right...? So... th-that rocket thing is gonna save the Capital, yeah? Then hit it on all sixes! We can take a trip to the Red- Light District to celebrate! The monster's stopped. It's all thanks to you and that rocket! Attaboy! This calls for a drink! You in?  The lecherous-looking man calmed down. ...Well, no point in a middle-aged guy like me telling young girls how to style their hair. Modern girl? Bring 'em on! Just as long as they're cute. ...Well, there's only one destination for a man and a  woman to end up. The sense of fulfillment  afterward is more important than how they got there. ...Sometimes it's important to back off and give a girl some space. But, don't forget to give chase. The pursuit of true love is how men work. ...Girls today are eating western food and it's changing the shapes of their bodies. Not that western clothes don't have advantages... like the way skirts blow in the wind. This is my own philosophy, but size isn't everything. Small has its merits. Everyone has their own tastes. Don't judge by looks alone. It's stupid to fight just because we're from different countries. After all, the fact that men like women is international. I guess it's not healthy for me to think about women all day, but... As a man, I think it's important that we not forget the greatness of woman. If it were me, you know... I'd take a picture of a girl. I'm not saying that to be a pervert. I'm just praising the beauty of woman. She got so scared she fainted? That's too bad for her, but... Isn't the defenseless face of a sleeping woman lovely? It makes me want to poun... I mean, protect her. Hmmm... So Major General Munakata is dating a high schooler, huh? A face like that and he's into  schoolgirls... Well, now I feel downright normal. That girl you were carrying looked familiar. How could I forget such a face? ...I've failed as a man. I know, I know. You've got quite a doll. She'd be a good match with that long-haired girl you were carrying earlier. I hope I live for a long time yet. There's a lot of good women out there; if I die, I'd miss out on meeting all of them. You know that girl who was always in front of the Assembly Hall? It's not like me, but... I got serious about her. I haven't seen her lately, though. ...I wonder if she's doing okay. Did you see the girl at the Assembly Hall? It's not like me, but I fell in love... I can crack jokes in front of girls I don't care about, but... I'm so pathetic, I can't even say hi to her. My wallet's feeling the pinch this month... I don't have any money to be fooling around. The restrictions couldn't have come at a better time. I'm glad they launched that  thing... ...I was just kidding about the Red-Light District. I know it's inapppropriate at a time like this. But, I hafta pretend to be cheerful... Or else I'd go stir crazy. After you become an adult, of course. Go do something about that  monster first. How could I live without the Red-Light District? When I say drink, I don't mean booze. You get soda. You may be the savior of the  Capital, but you're still under age. Under age, and yet our savior... What a huge difference between you and me. Those girls over there in the magenta uniforms are from Ouran High. I'd like to get inside their heads. I wonder what they think of me... Say, wasn't Daidouji's daughter going to Ouran High, too? Shopping at Ginza-Cho is fun, but the dessert parlor is the berries! It's always about food with you, huh Fumiko? Th-That's not true! I've been told I'm a real doll! Really? By who? A man? ...I'm not saying. You're just not the pretty type. You're more like the little sister who needs constant attention. Baloney! Don't treat me like a kid! People tell me I look real swell! Really? By who? A man? ...I'm not saying. *sigh* We have to hand in our post-graduation plans tomorrow. Have you decided yet, Yaeko? ...I was thinking of finding a job. We can't just play around forever. How about you? M-Me? I... you know... right? There's still so much I want to try, you know? ...Really? Well... I guess you're right. How was your English quiz today? ...So-so... I guess.  How about you? Huh? Oh... Me, too! I did so-so, too! You know, I was thinking. Studying English is kind of pointless, isn't it? That's kind of defiant, don't you think? ...Considering you fell asleep immediately after writing your name on the quiz today. I-I'm Japanese! A Japanese girl only needs to know Japanese! Now, let's go have some soda! ...... How was your Japanese history quiz today, Yaeko? ...All right, I guess. How about yours? Huh? Oh... Me, too! M-Mine was all right, too! ...... You know, I was thinking. Studying English is kind of pointless, isn't it? That's kind of defiant, don't you think? ...Considering you fell asleep immediately after writing your name on the quiz today. This dame lives for tomorrow! I don't look back to the past! ...By the way, you still haven't paid me back for that cake. I thought you weren't looking back to the past... Kaya's been absent for a while. Is her attendance record okay? ...What about you? Don't you have make-up tests in two subjects tomorrow? Th-That's why we came to the soda joint! For sugar intake! It'll spark my brain, and we can  study the chemistry of the soda. We'll kill two birds with one stone! ...... I saw a girl wearing this uniform by the detective agency. It was the first time I saw her, but I swear I've met her before. You've seen a girl before you ever met her? ...You're losing me, Fumiko. Argh, I'm all balled up! I can't get it out of my throat! Don't you mean... Oh, never mind. I tried talking to that girl by the detective agency, but she just ignored me. It's so weird... I know I've seen her somewhere. I just know it. You probably just mistook her for someone else. You can be pretty absent-minded sometimes. No way! I may have a sweet tooth, but my memory is actually pretty spicy. ...Never say that again. Oh what's the use? You took those make-up tests today, right? How were they? ...It was torture! I just stared blankly at the answer sheet! The questions were too hard! I think the teacher has it out for me! ...Hopeless. I managed to pass the make-up tests! Let's go celebrate at the dessert parlor! Fumiko... Didn't you say you were going on a diet a while back? Huh!? Wh-Wh-When did I say that? When is awhile back!? What day? What month? What year!? ...Whatever. You never said it; we'll leave it at that. Hey, Yaeko? My skirt feels tight lately... Really? I don't see a difference. That's it, I'm going on a diet! No compromises this time! You said that before... er, well...  I'm cheering for you... I guess. That soldier called me chubby! He called me pigtailed four-eyes. So rude! And how! I mean, that's so dull! I wish they could think of  something better! ...Huh? I'm so angry, Yaeko! I don't want some soldier calling me chubby! We'll show them! You should slim down and become pretty! You're right! This time, I'm serious! I'm going on a diet... next month! ...What? It's just one earthquake after the next! Harumi-Cho is messed up! We're gonna die, Yaeko! We're all gonna die! Fumiko, calm down, okay? I'm here! It'll be all right! Darn it all... I'm eating! I'll eat till my stomach bursts! ...Fumiko...  Never mind. The beautiful always die young... I'm going to be one with the stars. Yaeko... If you see a bright, twinkling star in the eastern night sky... think of me. ...Won't I be dead too? We're both still alive! This is just ducky! Come on, don't cry. ...Here, wipe your nose. I-I was so scared. Yaeko, I was really scared! If I had died, we wouldn't be able to go out for cake together! Fumiko...  The schoolgirls' thoughts can be heard... ...Yaeko's no sap. I don't think I can resist the temptation of cream puffs. At least that old lady in my neighborhood thinks I'm pretty. Is Fumiko better looking than me? She did have her hair bobbed recently... I guess short hair IS in. Yaeko's no sap. I still have my baby fat... Hardly an ideal figure. The only one who thinks I'm an adult is the old lady in my neighborhood... Come to think of it... She DOES have nice, round curves... Wow, Yaeko's so reliable. She's already planned out her future. I haven't thought of anything. Even tomorrow is a total blank. ...Fumiko's right. We're still young. Maybe it's too early to decide on the future. There are still other things to do! Fumiko did so-so... I can't be blindly confident like her. I answered all the questions, but... Yaeko did so-so!? All I did was write my name and fall asleep... I'm Japanese! I'm the ideal Japanese woman! And, now I feel like a soda!  Fumiko did alright... I'm not very confident about my score. I'm no good at remembering things... Yaeko did alright! It's all just memorization. My answer sheet was pure white! I'm living for tomorrow! I'm not turning back! I feel like we've been through this before... I guess history repeats itself. Oh, no! I completely forgot about my make-up tests! But, I can spark my brain with sugar. And that's like chemistry! Chemistry... Aren't tomorrow's make-ups on English and Japanese history...? I really can't get it out of my throat... Maybe I ate too much cake. It's get it out of my mind, not out of my throat. Looks like she needs to work on her Japanese, too. I may have a sweet tooth, but my memory is actually pretty spicy! ...If she's so confident about her memory, why is she taking two make-up tests? What did I do to upset the teacher...? Is it because I told him he has bad taste in neckties? That must be it! No wonder he has it out for me! ...We were at the parlor for a while yesterday. I bet she went straight to bed when she got home. It's her own fault she didn't know the answers... Oh no! I did say it! I said I'd go on a diet before! ...Well, whatever. I'll start tomorrow. I'll start this diet eventually. I can't believe she came up with such a lame excuse... Poor Fumiko isn't stupid. She just needs to study... I'm going to diet! Starting in a week... ...from the day after tomorrow! I'm sure it won't last long, but... I think she's serious this time. Go Fumiko! That soldier must be some sap if he's razzing people on their appearances. He needs to be more creative, like he could call me non-dynamite body!  I'm serious this time! I'm dieting... next month! Last time it was tomorrow... You're pushing it further and further back, Fumiko... Since I'm gonna die... I'll die eating cakes till my stomach bursts! ...Fumiko's so strong-willed; she has an appetite even at a time like this... She could survive anything. Who said that the beautiful die young...? Must have been someone a long time ago. ...They were all wet. And, I resent Mom and Dad for bringing me into this world so beautiful... ...Do people usually refer to themselves with that saying? Fumiko's got a lot of nerve. So much, I think she might have a point. Yaeko never eats an entire slice, so she always gives the rest to me. She's too kind. Yaeko, we're best friends forever! I was thinking I'd like a boyfriend soon, but... Things are okay right now. It's fun just being with Fumiko. You're as skinny as ever, Raidou dear. Are you eating right? Lately I've been getting tired so easily... I'm rather thin, as well. I just saw a shiny black automobile pass through Kamishiro-Zaka. Wonder how much that cost... I wish they'd cut an old woman a break... That Daidouji girl... She's 16 this year, isn't she? That's a good age. You should give her a shot, dear. The shiny black automobile just left. Those fumes, that noise...! I feel faint... I see that girl with the camera at Narumi's place all the time... ...Aha! So that's how it is. Raidou dear, you're such a thoughtful boy, giving them time together... The Ryugu owner is here, isn't she? I saw her around here several times. ...Aha! So that's how it is. She's so devoted. Narumi should take the hint. I've heard the Red Cape has been appearing here and there... It's so terrifying. I sleep with my bankbook under my pillow. They say light skin covers up imperfections. You have such nice, fair skin, dear. Now me, I'm dark... See? I wish I had light skin. There sure have been a lot of ship accidents lately. Konnou-Ya is the latest victim, I heard. It's so horrifying. I keep my  bankbook hanging around my neck. ...Narumi looked different today. Did he have a fight with his girlfriend? His face was hard and scary- looking... I couldn't approach him. I just saw Narumi. He had his arms around two men's shoulders. I wonder, are they his friends...? Just ducked out with that short- haired girl, huh? I saw everything. Maybe I should report this to  Narumi...! Now that I think about it, you were with that reporter before... And now you're walking around with a schoolgirl? Tsk, tsk... Hey! What happened to Narumi? He was walking around with a bloody nose. His shirt was soaked in blood... That kind of stain doesn't come off easily! Narumi looked like he was feeling better. He ought to start working hard again. He's behind on the rent, isn't he? I heard the landlady yelling at him last time. She's here, the landlady's here! She's steaming mad... But, I suppose anyone would lose her temper if the rent went unpaid for half a year... Where have you been all this time? Narumi was looking for you. I haven't seen Narumi around lately... He didn't do a runner, did he...? Without paying the rent? Narumi finally came back, but he looked like it was the end of the world... What on earth happened? That bearded man you were  dragging earlier looked like he had passed out... Choose your friends wisely, dear. Don't hang around people who get drunk in the middle of the day. The monster stopped, didn't it? That's what I heard. So, why did Narumi look so downhearted...?  The nosy old lady's spirit was rekindled. Men ought to have a little meat on their bones. You're too skinny, so start eating these, and don't stop until you're sumo wrestling material!  Raidou obtained  x1. Men need to have a little meat on their bones! What? Am I too loud? Life is something you have to walk through on your own two feet! A little more barefoot walking would do you good, Raidou dear. Men are supposed to chase after skirts! That's how it is! If you work all the time, you'll never meet any women! How about it, Raidou dear? Up for a lap or two around town? Men are supposed to be rough and aggressive! Be considerate of other people, sure, but you can't forget about your own happiness! Narumi is a lucky man to have such a pretty girl flirt with him! Why's he so stubborn? The boy needs to hurry up and get married! I heard there was a stalwart  defender of justice who stood up to the Red Cape! I don't know about you, but I'm impressed. An act of bravery like that deserves a reward. You're always wearing that cloak. Is that to prevent tanning? Well, I think men look better  tan! It makes them look like wild, untamed beasts! I hear a nice young man saved Konnou-Ya's shipment at Harumi-Cho! I don't know about you, but I'm impressed! An act of bravery like that deserves a reward! Women are powerless when they're caught up in the moment! After a battle, all you have to do is grab hold of her and give her a kiss right on the cheek! Ohh! That look in Narumi's eyes! Those were the eyes of a man who's been to hell and back! Narumi's no doubt having a drink with his buddies, talking about girls! I wish I could be a fly on that wall! Not bad, Raidou dear. You've become a man! How bold of you to bring in a girl while Narumi's away... Don't tell me, I know! I'll keep  quiet. I'm not that tactless! You're too kind, dear. You can't say no, can you? I wouldn't have pegged you as a doormat! Don't worry, it's okay! Men need to be able to fight. The blood on his shirt is a badge of his manliness. No need to  wash it! Narumi's gotta demonstrate to his landlady how reliable he can be. I know Narumi can do it if he just puts his mind to it! Narumi's a spiffy young man. He's always wearing that stylish jacket. They say that classy men go into debt looking good. Raidou dear... You were out late and didn't tell Narumi, weren't you? Don't worry, you don't have to say a thing! I know how to keep a secret. Narumi should just apologize, and tell his landlady he can't pay if he doesn't have the money! She's human, too. If he gives it to her straight, she'll understand! As long as you're still breathing, your luck is bound to turn around! Tell that to Narumi! With a long face like his, good luck will turn and run the other way! Turning to alcohol isn't the  answer! You tell the bearded man I said that! If he keeps at it, then whack him one on the head! Narumi's long face must be because of his tab at Ryugu! That boy's got no guts... All he's got is a big, fat tab. You're as skinny as ever, Raidou dear. Are you eating right? Lately I've been getting tired so easily... I'm rather thin, as well.  The nosy old lady's spirit was rekindled. Men ought to have a little meat on their bones. You're too skinny, so start eating these, and don't stop until you're sumo wrestling material!  Raidou obtained  x1. Men need to have a little meat on their bones! What? Am I too loud? The girl by Ushigome-gaeri Bridge last night looked like Daidouji's daughter... True, it WAS rainy and she was  far away... but I'd never forget such a pretty face. Looking for the Daidouji place? You see the building behind me with the Tawara-Ya sign? Just go that way. You'll see a mansion I'll never be able to afford. First Takeshi, and now Kaya... The Daidouji family's going through some rough times. Is it an unlucky year for them? The Army's prowling around now... Looks like something big. Every time I pass by, they stare at me out of the corners of their eyes. It's a little creepy, y'know? There's an Army officer at  Daidouji's place, I hear. The military and aristocrats together... Sounds shady to me. Might be time for another protest. The Army pulled out of the Daidouji Residence. The military and aristocrats together... It's always shady when powerful men talk in private. I saw a man take off from the Daidouji Residence, quick as a speeding train. ...Well, I thought it was a man, but it moved like some kind of animal. They say the Black Cape  defeated the Red Cape at  Ginza-Cho. ...They didn't mean you, did they? I heard there was a scuffle at a factory in Senju. The Black Cape appeared to intervene... That's not you, is it? I heard they found a foreign merchant dead at Harumi-Cho. What do you think happens to his property, now that the owner's dead? I saw a young couple out on a small boat the other night. The boat looked weird, though. I swear it had fur... I hear the Navy took some guy into custody. I feel sorry for him. Those guys are professionals; one wrong move and he'll be spitting teeth. I saw a naval officer come from the shrine at Shinoda. I guess even soldiers pray to the gods for help.  I hear Narumi's new assistant is about the same age as you. Was he making that much money? I didn't think he could afford to hire anyone. The Army is dispatching soldiers everywhere, not just here. I wonder what's about to happen... Nothing good, that's for sure. I was wondering what kind of trouble was brewing, with all these Army soldiers around... And it was just about that ball they launched? That's kind of disappointing... H-Hey, there's a monster at Harumi-Cho, right? What's the Army doing? Are things going to be okay if we just leave it to the Navy? Harumi-Cho's pretty messed up. Although, I didn't go see for myself... They say even women and children were killed... The monster at Harumi-Cho stopped! Its knees just bent down and the head came right off. Now it's stopped stone cold!  The passing deliveryman's spirit was rekindled. That was Daidouji's girl! I saw her! It was definitely her! I'll bring her back and claim the reward. Plus, a commendation from the police chief! There's no escaping my bike! My house may be just one story tall, but all seven of us are happy there! Myself, the wife, and the kids all sleep in the same room. The power should be in the hands of the people! Down with the daimyo system! Protect the principles of fair government! As long as the newspapers are the voice of the people, there's nothing to fear from the government! Bring on the next Taisho revolution! After seeing the way that guy from Daidouji's place moved, I feel like hitting it on all sixes! Bicycles are okay, but you can't beat the good old 633cc cycle! The girl I just saw by Ushigome- gaeri Bridge looked like Daidouji's daughter. Was I mistaken...? But, there aren't lookers like her around here every day...  The passing deliveryman's spirit was rekindled. That was Daidouji's girl! I saw her! It was definitely her! I'll bring her back and claim the reward! And, a commendation from the police chief! There's no escaping my bike! It hasn't been very long since you came to Mr. Narumi's place, right? Ah! Then do you know about... that? Of course I know.Is that so... Oh, of course. I'm talking about the old family mansion here in Yarai-Ku, the one that's curs-- Wait a second, I'm not falling for  that! I am a model of discretion. You went to the Daidouji Residence? ...Don't you know about that rumor? You knew and went anyway!? Well, aren't we the daredevil? Oh, of course. I'm talking about the pet at that house, the one that feeds on human-- The Daidouji Residence is a two- story house... on the surface. But... have you heard that rumor? Of course I have.I guess it's true what they say. The rich are very different from you and me. Oh, of course. I'm talking about the hidden floor, that not even the servants know about... Kaya's so pretty, but I never see her with any suitors. It's probably because... well, you know, don't you? Sad, isn't it? The beautiful really do die young... Oh, of course. It's probably because when a Daidouji girl turns 16-- I always thought of Kiyoshi Daidouji as a simple and honest man, but... He's got his dark side, too. ...Do you know about that rumor? I hope it's just a rumor. It's too depressing to be true... Oh, of course. I mean that Kiyoshi and his older brother Takeshi are actually-- Hey! Did you hear about... you know... the Daidoujis? Of course I heard.Oh, really... Oh, of course. I'm talking about Kiyoshi, and how they're searching the house-- Wait a second, I'm not falling for that! Other people's affairs are their own business. Have you heard about the Kurisu- zaka in Chujou-Ku? During a full moon-- Wait a second, I'm not going to blab about other wards! What happens there, stays there. Did I see the accident at Kurisu- zaka? Sure I did! Say, you wouldn't be... Oh, pardon me. I shouldn't meddle in other people's business. There's been another accident at Ginza-Cho. Could it be... Wait a second, I'm not going to blab about other wards! What happens there, stays there. The servants at the Daidouji Residence are on leave. Such a big mansion, and it's so empty and quiet now... A perfect place for ghosts, don't you think? I haven't seen Mr. Nakamura lately... I guess with his age and all the odd goings-on, he's got his hands full at the mansion. I heard Mr. Nakamura collapsed. No wonder I haven't seen him around lately. ...I bet the servants are grateful for the chance to relax. Mr. Nakamura wasn't seriously ill, but they say he's going to keep resting, just in case. He must be tired with everything that's been going on. Mr. Nakamura is back on the job. I saw him walking down the street a while back. ...He didn't seem like he'd fully recovered, though. He didn't have his usual imperious manner. Cameras sometimes take pictures of things we can't see with the naked eye. Ghosts, for instance. I bet you could get some good pictures at the Daidouji Residence. If they don't find Kaya... do you think they'll adopt another girl? But, what if they adopt someone else and THEN find Kaya? That schoolgirl who went from the dessert parlor to the Daidouji  Residence... It's strange, but she reserved a cake. What's to celebrate at a time like this? I saw that schoolgirl carry a large cake to the Daidouji Residence. ...She seemed glum. The cake in her hands made everything look even more bleak somehow. It looks like the adoption rumor might be true. I heard they're considering a girl the same age as Kaya. The Daidouji household is in turmoil with people saying they saw Kaya. ...They're probably mistaking anyone in an Ouran High uniform for Kaya. Kaya used to come to this town often. ...Just like those schoolgirls over there. She's no different than them... I saw Kaya walking with her friend... They both looked pretty down, like they had a secret just between them. Mr. Nakamura's been popular lately. He's suddenly a lot easier to talk to... Hard to believe it's the same obstinate guy. If Kaya's all right, she must have seen that thing that launched. We're all under the same sky... If that monster comes this way... Will the servants be able to escape if they have to carry Takeshi, too? Well, all's well that ends well, isn't it? Now all we need is for Kaya to be found safe.  The knowledgeable young lady's thoughts can be heard... Boring though it is, a regular life is best. I don't want to be cursed! The scent of blood there... I'm so glad I wasn't born into that family! That place really is a haunted mansion. It even has a pet monster. I better not go near it or else I could end up as dinner! The monster has an entire floor to itself? I wish I had that much space. Its room must be bigger than my house... All the Daidouji girls die around the age of 16... That's too regular to be a congenital disease. It almost seems supernatural... I wonder if it's an inferiority complex toward his brother... Even then... Kiyoshi wanting Takeshi dead is a little hard to swallow. Now Kiyoshi's missing... The police investigation doesn't stand a chance. What can they do against a curse? An automobile accident every full moon is pretty suspicious. Which is stronger... Yarai-Ku's curse or the Daidouji curse...? He's visited the Daidouji Residence, and on top of that, he went to the scene of the accidents... This schoolboy... Is he into the occult or something? Surely accidents can't happen at the same spot so many times... It's not as severe a case as the Daidouji Residence, but... is Ginza-Cho possessed...? It hasn't been very long since you came to Mr. Narumi's place, right? Ah! Then do you know about ...that? Of course I know.Is that so... Here in Yarai-Ku, there's an old family mansion. There's a curse on... ...! Oh, no, I'm not falling that. I am a model of discretion.  The knowledgeable young lady's thoughts can be heard... Boring though it is, a regular life is best. I don't want to be cursed! The scent of blood there... I'm so glad I wasn't born into that family! I've been in the Navy for a while now, but this is the first mission I've ever been reluctant to take. I mean, we're essentially taking an injured man hostage... Why'd they put me on this case? And officer could do it, for crying out loud! I worked hard to get where I am, yet everyone else gets to sit in the office all day...  Detective Kazama's spirit was rekindled. We didn't join the police force to sit behind desks all day! We belong out on the streets where the crimes take place! That's why I'm here! Whooooaaaaaa! What just happened!? Why are they forcing me to stake out Narumi? This is all our informant's fault! We already have witnesses placing him at Ushigome-gaeri Bridge the moment that girl disappeared. What else do we need? Just handcuff the guy and put him away for good! Even if he is just beating his gums, is that something a cop should be saying? , you think this missing girl of his is the one we met last night? Maybe we should show him what you found at the bridge.  Raidou showed the Butterfly Brooch to Detective Kazama. *sigh* I don't have the patience for this, Raidou. I told you, there's nothing to see here. Show him the brooch.Oh, it's a swallowtail butterfly. ...This looks just like the Daidouji family crest! Nah... The similarities are there, but it couldn't be the same one. ...Well that's that. At least we know our client was the same missing girl. , we should probably head over to the . Her family should be a lot more helpful than this sap. Scram, or I'll be forced to cuff you and take you in! ...Something doesn't make sense. Why would Narumi want to kidnap a member of the Daidouji family? Bah, I don't need to know the motive when he's been fingered at the scene of the crime. ...... ...Wha--!? Oh! It's you, Raidou! Hey, you really look different. You look like a man now. ...I used to be the leader of the local gang of punks. But, now I'm sporting this cherry blossom crest, workin' on the side of the law. Even though I'm using cuffs instead of my fists, I still hate crooked people. I decided to become a flatfoot cause I can be myself... with what little brains I got. You've got the same eyes I did when I was young: reckless, yet straightforward. ...Take this, will ya? When you get to be my age, make sure to keep that sparkle in your eyes.  Raidou obtained the . Uh, hey... This guy's kind of checking us out. Do you think he's going to get fresh? What should we do? He's probably just some pushover. Ignore him. Oh you're all wet. That's not how you really feel. ...Need anything, sir? Show them the photo of KayaYou're a detective?  ...What'd Kaya do, elope? ...Don't get excited, Fumiko. That must be what happened, Yaeko! That's why she's been missing school-- she ran off with a man! I always thought Kaya was a bluenose... I guess she showed me! If you want dirt on Kaya, you should be talking to . I see them together in the  all the time. Hey, see that alley across the street, there? It's the one you take to the Narumi Detective Agency and Konnou-Ya. I think that's Rin over there. Please don't bother them, Mr. Detective... I think they're having a moment together. You read too many romance novels... Uh, hey... This guy's kind of checking us out. Do you think he's going to get fresh? What should we do? He's probably just some pushover. Ignore him. ...Right. As if I don't know what's really on your mind. If you want dirt on Kaya, you should be talking to . I see them together in the  all the time. Hey, see that alley across the street, there? I think that's Rin over there... Please don't bother them, Mr. Detective... I think they're having a moment together. You read too many romance novels. ...Huh. I could have sworn I just saw her in that alley... She must have gone home.  The schoolgirls' thoughts can be heard. I am so hungry. Would it make me a gold digger if I asked this guy to buy me dinner? ...His face is swell, like a fairytale prince. He's my type to a T... I think I might be stuck on him. I'm sorry, but I hope that investigation leads nowhere. Kaya and her lover deserve to be happy. Just leave them alone! Why's it always Kaya? I go to the same school! I know I'm not as dolled up, but... ...Should I wear my hair down? Maybe I should bob it, like Rin. *sigh* Ugh...  Her face is deathly pale. She's in no condition to answer questions. Don't throw in the towel, . People like her often have the most important information. In situations like this, your ancestors turned to . Mind reading is kind of a  specialty.   The exhausted servant's thoughts can be heard. Why'd I have to listen to him talk about his stupid turtle? All I needed was the wine...! ...Taking a cold bath together? Ugh, it makes me sick to my stomach. What I need right now is for a gentleman to make me feel like a lady. Get a hold of yourself!Y-You're right! I am a professional servant. I take pride in my job! But... even still... I'm still just a girl... I'm entitled to have my bad days... Huh? Oh, um, yes! Fine! I feel quite a bit better now. THANK you... trust me. Here, you can have this! This wine came from the owner of Tawara-Ya. It was free... He said he got it for his dead turtle. ...But, that gives me the heebie- jeebies, and it's heavy, so... I really don't want it! ...I could go for a snack. Dessert parlor, here I come! Mmmm... Triple-chocolate sundae. For your information, I always eat the cherry first!  Raidou obtained the . Detective Kazama is a man who's serious about his job. You can tell he has a passion for his work. He's so hot-headed, he loses it sometimes and says things that he shouldn't... Detective Kazama is easily excitable, but calms down fast. If he says he'll do something, he'll do it, but you better believe him if he says he's giving up, too. Detective Kazama left. He was assigned to another case. He's a good detective, really. He just has personality problems. Was that a scream...!? Oh, it's just the schoolgirls at the dessert parlor again. Girls their age laugh at the drop of a hat. Detective Kazama is a man who's serious about his job. You can tell he has a passion for his work. He's so hot-headed, he says things he shouldn't when he loses it... Detective Kazama is easily excitable as well as easily cooled. ...Some say that's flakiness. If he says he'll do something, he'll do it, but you better believe him if he says he's giving up, too. Excuse me, I'm looking for a place called Konnou-Ya. I needed to purchase something... Y'know, like a-antiques... Excuse me, I'm looking for a place called Konnou-Ya. I needed to purchase someth-- Oh! Is that one of those famous Ox Bezoars!? ...A young lad like you has no use for something like that, right? I'd be happy to take it off your hands. My wife's been... ill, you see... Sure, it's yours.Ohh ho! Thank you! You've saved our marriage! This will solve everything! H-Here, just take this!  Raidou obtained . Y-Yeah, that's fine... Your decision anyway. Thank you! You've saved our marriage!  The gentleman in a suit's thoughts can be heard... ...Where is this place? This Konnou-Ya? I came all the way to Tsukudo- Cho by train cause I heard it was around here... Ox Bezoar! Where could it be? I need it to save our marriage! At last, the Ox Bezoar, savior of our marriage! It's been three long months, but finally! A boogie night! Excuse me, I'm looking for a place called Konnoh-Ya. I was asked to buy something. You know... a-antiques. Excuse me, I'm looking for a place called Konnoh-Ya. I was asked to buy... oh! Is that the rumored Ox Bezoar!? ...I-I mean... A young chap like you has no need for that, right? I would be happy to rid you of it. For my s... sick wife, you see. Sure.Oh? Ohh! Thank you so much! You are the savior of our marriage! This is my thanks. Please, take it.  Raidou obtained . I... I see... It's okay. I don't mind at all. Not at all... *sigh* Thank you! You are the savior of our marriage!  The gentleman in a suit's thoughts can be heard... ...Where is this place?

I need it to save our marriage! At last, the Ox Bezoar, savior of our marriage! It's been three long months, but finally! A boogie night! Ignorant civilians... Democracy is nothing but a large-scale quarrel. All those birdbrains care about are the goodies set in front of them. It's taking awhile. That lousy Kiyoshi's being difficult, huh? We all know that birdbrain will break down in the end. Hmmm. You're fairly tall... Your jaw looks weak, though. That's what happens when you eat western food. You should eat more dry foods. Hmmm. You're fairly tall... Your legs are too skinny, though. You're not sticking to the escalators, are you? Wear iron shoes; that'll build strong bones. My little brother here just said his first words, as I was passing Konnou-Ya. Gouma-Den! Gouma-Den! he said. Look how happy he is! ...What's Gouma-Den, though? Do you know, mister?  The carried baby's thoughts can be heard. Gouma-Den issa under Konnou-Ya. Wanna make 100 friends. Buddies, playmates, demons... I bet all that running around town makes you thirsty. Our ice will hit the spot, guaranteed! How about some for your cat and your friend... Wait, what? One, two... Huh. There's just you and the cat. What was I saying...?  The gentle ice vendor's spirit was rekindled. Would you believe I'm 43 years old? I'm younger than I look! I have a chunk of our all-natural ice as part of my daily routine!  Our ice is the secret of my youth! I bet all that running around town makes you thirsty.

I'm younger than I look! I have a chunk of our all-natural ice as part of my daily routine!  Our ice is the secret of my youth! That deadbeat detective isn't home right now... That Narumi is late on his payments again, and he has the nerve to go out to eat! How many notices did I send him!? I got so mad, I locked him out! That deadbeat Narumi is lazy, perverted, unkempt...  The Ginroukaku landlady continues her litany of complaints... ...Which is all to say, we can't get in.  The Ginroukaku landlady calmed down. Then again, Narumi can be a nice guy... He helps me carry heavy loads, and he always notices when I've done something different with my hair. But, that's then, and this is now! How many notices do I need to send him!? I got so mad, I locked him out! I wish I hadn't tried to repay my shopping debts by gambling... I'm leaving this place. Tomorrow I'm moving to Fukagawa-Cho... to work the Red-Light District. I'll just think of it as starting an exciting new life. I can't get squeamish already! It's all thanks to our victory over other countries that you can live in peace, you know? You should show more respect instead of scowling at us. Thanks to the Tai-itsu satellite, our country will be feared throughout the world. Don't forget to show some respect, now. *chuckle* Y-You're blaming me, aren't you!? I see the blame in those eyes of yours! I-It wasn't me! If I knew this would happen, I would've resigned! It's the West that's the enemy, not our own people! Why are we attacking ourselves!? Y-You mean there was another monster after we defeated the first one? Well, if it's kill or be killed, I won't go down without a fight, even if all I have is this saber! What soldier's afraid of monsters? What self-respecting serviceman would let down his countrymen? Martial law has been declared for the entire Capital. Just when I finally get a little furlough, this happens. I'm warning you--don't get on my bad side today. It's a good thing the townspeople here are reasonable. That way, I don't have to waste valuable riot shells. I-I don't know any more than you do about the monster... When I demand an explanation from the top brass, they just tell me to hold my position... What is His Excellency Major General Munakata doing!? This is Japan's greatest crisis! The folks in Tsukudo-Cho have no way of knowing about the second monster... Please... Could you keep quiet about it? There's no reason to start a panic with the citizens... Tsukudo-Cho is the only district where we deployed reinforcements. What's so special about this place? What are the top brass so concerned about? Looks like the launch was a success. They should be pulling us  reinforcement soldiers out soon, then. I heard about an ex-soldier who resigned, indicting his senior officer. Former insiders are troublesome, huh? In some ways, they're scarier than enemy troops. What's my hee-name? Say it, ho! You better get it right or we'll hee-have it out! Say the right name or we rumble, ho! Raiho...Well, right, but... Aww, you hee-had to go and spoil my fun, hee ho... Woo-ho! That's what I was hoping to hear, hee-ho! One-on-one duels aren't much fun in this game, don't you think, ho? Hee-so I brought some friends! Prepare to be-ho an ice sculpture, hee! Hee hee ho... You don't get the hee-joke, ho! That game wasn't released here, no! What a bummer. I can't even get angry now, ho... Mmm...? My uh... brain is in sleep mode... Don't ask me anything hard... Anything hard... YesYesYesYesYes Raidou picked up the receiver and inserted a coin. Capital Daily Newspaper, how may I direct your call? May I speak to Tae, please?Tae? Kichou? May I ask who's calling? This is Raidou Kuzunoha.Raidou Kuzunoha? One moment while I transfer you. ? One moment while I transfer you. ...... Who is this? I don't know anyone named Kuzu-no-whatever. Me? I'm Tae, Katsutoshi Tae. ...Sorry, I'm hanging up now. I'm not interested in whatever you're selling. Looks like that was the wrong person. , I heard you got married? How are things? How's work? ...Huh? You're a detective!? Who is this? I don't know any detective. Me? I'm Tae. Katsutoshi Tae. ...Sorry, I'm hanging up now. I don't have any need for a detective. What! You just kicked me out, and now you want me to help you!? He's making you ask me because he doesn't have the guts? You shouldn't clean up after your idiot boss.  Raidou asked about the taxi attacks at Ginza. ...Can we meet in person? I have a pretty hot scoop on that one, but I shouldn't say over the phone. Somewhere close by would be best. I'm kind of busy. How about the Shin-Sekai soda joint? You know, in Ginza. I'll be waiting for you there. Remember, that's Shin-Sekai.  Raidou can hear a faint voice from the receiver. ...I don't...ow a perso... that name. I'm... usy... so just... an excuse. I'm sorry to have kept you waiting. Ms. Kichou is away from her desk right now. I apologize for the inconvenience. Goodbye! ...Excuse me, are... Are you from the Narumi Detective Agency? That's right. I assume you're the bird who gave us a call? Y-Yes, well... *sigh* Listen sweetheart, we run a legitimate business, and we don't have time for games. If you're having trouble at home, why don't you just go talk to your teacher about it? Sir, please! It... It isn't like that... I want you to... kill me. Otherwise, I-- Hold on a second... Kill you? What are you talking about? ...Damn it. Yeah, I just have some business with Konnou-Ya, y'know? Sure, they're military... but they're still human, so I'm not worried... Just be careful. Tae disappeared? Either she moved, or she was taken... If that camera's your only clue, you oughtta go to Konnou-Ya instead of me. Descendants of the gods are all over Kasumidai. I didn't expect them to use the Dark Realm to interfere. If it materialized due to someone's strong belief in the occult, then... Maybe it's him...? Raidou, go save Tae. Prepare yourself for a knuckle- duster of a demon fight. Munakata!? So... It IS him. We'll leave Tae up to that sad-sack Sadakichi. I have a gut feeling about Sadakichi's testimony. Let's cooperate with him and get to the bottom of this. She's probably got some reason why she can't stand up to Munakata... A young girl like that asking us to kill her... Breaks your heart... All right, Raidou, this is it. Go to the Army's Subterranean Shipbuilding Facility for me. The captive princess is waiting for her prince to come to the rescue. A top-drawer journalist like me pays attention to even minor details like these. If you have shopping to do, get it done now. Come to think of it, I'm still considered missing, huh? ...It'd be a pain if someone reported me. Let's go look for the crystal. ...It'd be a pain if someone reported me. Let's go look for the Irie Fudou. Why did I cut my hair like this? No particular reason, it just got in the way. Hair length doesn't make any difference to me. ...Hm? That man... Hey you... Over there... Yeah, come over here... Oh, Raidou, it's you. Sorry about that.  I thought you were someone else. ... I should've known. If he's involved, you can bet something's about to go wrong. Move along, Raidou. I have no business with you. Look, I'm on a stakeout, okay? I'm busy. Why'd they put me on this case? And officer could do it, for crying out loud! I worked hard to get where I am, yet everyone else gets to sit in the office all day... He's really down. It's not like him. . This guy always blurts out inappropriate things. If we use a demon to rekindle his spirits, maybe we can gain some valuable information.  If you approach certain people and objects while you have a demon summoned, you can investigate using .  Press  to open the menu, summon  and approach Detecitve Kazama. Why'd they put me on this case? And officer could do it, for crying out loud! I worked hard to get where I am, yet everyone else gets to sit in the office all day... ...Thinking about it, a kidnapper wouldn't just linger around town with the victim... Ahh, I quit! Suspecting Narumi was a stupid idea in the first place!  Detective Kazama's spirit was rekindled. Whooooaaaaaa! What just happened!? Why are they forcing me to stake out Narumi? Just because he was with the missing girl a Ushigome-gaeri Bridge! There's no way I can find a single schoolgirl in this humongous Captial! I quit! I'll just go apologize later to the Daidoujis! Raidou! I'll give you this! Take it, ya thief! Looks like he let too much blood to his head. I didn't think he'd desert his job... ...! This girl... She's the schoolgirl that was abducted last night...!  The back of the picture has Ouran High School Entrance Ceremony, Kaya Daidouji, 15 written on it. The girl abducted by those Special Guards is a student of . ...And her name is . A girl of her age would probably spend more time with friends rather than family. Let's go find other students of Ouran High and find out about this Kaya.  Raidou obtained the . I don't care what they've done in the past Who the hell they think they are, just sitting behind a desk all day! Crimes happen at the crime scene, dammit! Hey, is that schoolboy looking at us? Is he inviting us? Should we invite him? ...He looks like he has a lot of girls to choose from, from that face. He's just playing around with us. Don't make eye contact. ...Oh, come on. I know you're not thinking that. ...Is there something you want with us? Show them the photo of KayaWh-What...! We don't know anything! Even if we did, we wouldn't tell you! You dolt! ...What a farce, trying to hide things from a Devil Summoner. , read these girls' minds. .   Hey, is that schoolboy looking at us? Is he inviting us?

Oh, perfect timing. See that girl in front of the dessert parlor in our uniform? That's Rin. She's friends with Kaya, so why don't you ask her?  The schoolgirls' thoughts can be heard... *sigh* I'm hungry... I wonder about that schoolboy. Maybe I'll go if it's on him... ...He has such a beautiful face, like a prince in a fairy tale... Oh no, I can feel myself turning red to the ear... I can't even make eye contact... Is her in some occult club? Is he researching the  But it's said that you'll be cursed if you speak of it to people from other schools... Why is it always Kaya!

Who are you to her?Reveal your identityRaidou of the Narumi Detective Agency? So you're looking for Kaya? I'm Rin, a friend of Kaya. If you're a detective... Then will you save her? ...She was suffering... due to the blood that flows through her body...  Did you know about it? Kaya's... The Daidouji family's rumor... When a daughter of the family turns 16, a demon possesses her and kills her. I don't believe it, but Kaya was afraid of it... She also said that she felt like someone was watching her. I saw them too, one time. These strange Special Guards in red were following her... Her family's rich. Plus her father's condition isn't well... Someone after the inheritance might be trying to get rid of her. Mr. Detective, please. Save her... Save Kaya.  It all started with a single kidnapping...  But it would evolve into an event that would shake the nation.  All the secrets will be revealed this fall.  It's a Dragon Cave.

Are you Raidou Kuzunoha of the Narumi Detective Agency? This is a place where those who know the secret goings-on of the world, light and dark, gather. Everyone knows the truth of demons here. Feel free to talk to our patrons and exchange information. There you are, Raidou. Been investigating the Red Cape for me, have you? Ducky! You're so much more reliable than your lazy piker of a boss. I've been following my own leads, of course. There have been Red Cape sightings around here in Ginza-Cho, did you know? And, that's just the tip of the iceberg! The Red Cape is always seen on the night of a full moon. There was a full moon on the night of my interview, too. Which means, Raidou... If we're going to catch the Red Cape, we'd best go hunting for it on a full moon. He's been most commonly spotted on the road connecting Ryugu to central Ginza-Cho. Kurisu-zaka, beneath the overpass. Sorry to be a pest, Raidou, but could you go check it out during a full moon? If everything goes according to plan, you should be able to catch the Red Cape! Plus, I'll reward you with this. Don't tell Narumi--this'll be our little secret.  Raidou obtained . It's my way of saying thanks for doing such a swell job. Use it for whatever you want. Good luck, Raidou. If you catch the Red Cape, you've got my business card! Get in touch! A reporter's work is never done, eh Raidou? Oh! You've found yourself a cutie pie, I see. Um, hello... My name is Kaya. I've been working at the detective agency. I know, dear; Mr. Narumi already filled me in. Kaya, was it? The name's Kichou Asakura, ace reporter. Nice to meetcha. What are you two kids up to? Out on another case?  Raidou asked Tae about the Irie Fudou. Hm... Irie Fudou... Raidou, did you know this area used to be under water? It was part of the Hibiya inlet until they reclaimed the area during the Edo period. ...I know there was a Fudou statue here before that. ...The local people worshipped it, actually. I want to say that's the Irie Fudou you're looking for. And... does that statue still exist somewhere? *smirk* You crazy kids are in luck. I came across that scoop just the other day while researching a story on Ginza-Cho. This comes straight from the horse's mouth... An odd stone statue was found at the center of Ginza-Cho, and nobody knows where it came from. See, there are all kinds of development projects going on in Ginza-Cho right now. One of the construction teams found the statue in question. Well, the construction company was all balled up about what to do with the thing. ...Which is where I came in, looking for any information in the old town records. I don't know if it's your Irie Fudou... ...but at least it's an old statue, right? I'd wager its as good a shot as you're likely to get. Oh-ho, so you're back safely. Have you defeated Munakata? Looks like you weren't able to stop the real threat, though. Heh. Well, it's not my problem. Right now... It's more important that she and I discuss our future together. H-Hey, lay off that stuff. You're giving me the creeps. Oh! Raidou, you got here just in time... This lush won't stop bugging me. Isn't there something you can do about him? Come on, babe, even if you and this guy already have a thing going... There's no reason we can't have a little fun on the side.  What do you say? ...Can this guy really help? Well, I guess there's no way to know until we try it. Let's ask him. Can't you see I'm busy here?  Raidou gave Rasputin Tsiolkovski's Equation. This is... a basic equation for matter propulsion. One of my country's scientists derived it. Why are you showing me this? ...You want me to help you launch a rocket? Shove off! Can't you see the lady and myself are having a private moment here? ...... We might have to get our hands dirty, , but we've got to take him with us. All we've got to do is drag him to Victor's place... It's up to him how hard it'll be. Ask againWhat an irritating brat! Shoo, kid, you bother me. Nobody likes a stubborn man. Get out of here already. Raidou! Are you all right? ...Is Narumi okay? Things aren't so bad here, but it's pandemonium down south. Buildings in ruins, fires everywhere... The citizens are panicking, and I don't blame 'em. This huge monster just came outta nowhere and leveled the city... ...Say... Raidou... I've got a hunch you already know all of this, don't you? In fact, I'd bet good money that you were the one who stopped it. Am I right? And yet... I can tell, it's not over. I can read it all over your face. Well, I won't ask you any favors right now. So, Raidou... Just do what you have to. I know you can. Even if I don't understand what's going on... I'll be rooting for you. If anybody can save us, it's you, Raidou!  The Amatsu Kanagi began to glow in response to Tae's words. Well, I've said my piece. Be careful, Raidou. Looks like the Amatsu Kanagi is gaining power. It's still not enough, though... We still need more power, . Move on to another person. You'll need to perform the ritual at Ushigome-gaeri Bridge. The game's afoot, Raidou!

The Dark Realm. This is the place where all demons come from. Look sharp, . Well, would you look at that. Ha! Looks like they underestimated us. , let's show him what a Devil Summoner is made of. Huh!? A Devil Summoner! Come to interrupt the great Tsuchigumo's feast, have you!? Just go ahead and try it, punks! Looks like we'll have to smack this guy around before he'll give up the girl, . See that? It's a Force seal talisman. Your better class of demon can create seals like that. Let's destroy it and move on, . temp message Good morning. You're that, uh, that Summoner, aren't you? Yes, I am.Whew, that makes me nervous. I dunno, that sounds a bit aquatic... er, I mean, fishy. Why won't anyone talk to me? I'm so alone... so alone... You! You! You! You! You! You! ...... You! You! You! You! ...... I've been thinking about visiting somewhere overseas lately... I thought of somewhere else I need to go before I die. I'm gonna take a vacation someday. And, I know just the place. I'm gonna go... I've been fascinated with anywhere outside the ocean lately. To Istanbul. To Sicily. To Buenos Aires. To Cote d'Ivoire. To Olympia. To Liverpool. To the Taj Mahal. To Alexandria. To Firenze. Hey there. You're a greenhorn, aren't ya? I guess so.You've got a lot to learn, sonny. I could teach you a thing or two. That's garbage, ain't it? Don't get ideas above yer station. Oh ho, a big shot, are you? Yer pretty tough for a greenhorn. There's a bugger of a wall up ahead. Some guys don't, y'know, care about elemental affiliation. Those guys are rotten to th'core. It's a shame, it is. Hey, you there! Yeah, you. Are you really going on ahead? Oh-ho. So, you're after that girl, are you? You're kidding, right? You're really after the girl, aren't you? Well, I'm sure you can see that brute over there. Now there's a demon that's out of our league. Don't bother with him. How about playing with us instead, okay? temp message Ahh, rats. You went and did it after all. I'm pretty steamed. In fact, I'm so pissed, I'm ready to explode. ...But, I could still lose if I did that. So... Help. Don't kill me. Spare me. SOS. Et cetera. Spare himHeeey, I feel a greater... kinship with you, or something. Too bad it's a lie. You're a tough one to please. Y-You're strong, ain't ya? Hmmm... Well, add another ten affinity points for me! You're a sharp cookie. I'm starting to take a shine to you, boy. Good luck, greenhorn. ...... Hey, long time no see, affinity- bro. I'd say you've grown a little. No? Well, I've got a lotta... ehh... respect! For you, y'see. ! Har har har! Dumbass! I had your number right from the start! no way to pass through a Dragon's Jaw. I can't believe we have to take the long way around when he's right there in front of us. ... This is your first time to the Dark Realm, isn't it, ? Let me explain how things work here. A Dragon's Jaw is like a wall in the Dark Realm. You should be careful not to touch it.  If there's one in the way, just give up and look for another way around it. If you run up against the laws of this world, you can get in trouble. Got it, ? Wha... a Dragon's Jaw here, too? Well, it can't be helped, . Let's look for another way around.  Raidou obtained Rin's Handkerchief. Looks like this is that girl's handkerchief. Now that we've got one of her belongings, we should be able to track her with your demons. It's much better to use demons instead of just running around the Dark Realm blind. If you summon a Wind-order demon... It'll be able to follow the flow of air straight to our target. Hmm? That's...? Hey, that's a pretty lady. Daddy told me what I should say if I ever met a lady that pretty... Ho-lee crap. Is that what you're supposed to say? She's so cool, though. She can get rid of ouchies. But, she says she needs money. What's money, though? Does it taste good? Past those stairs, there's a bad, bad . It kidnapped a girl! I'm just a kid. I'd never do anything bad like that... Hee ho! Huh? You're a human, ho! Yes, I am.I hee-know! You wanna be-ho friends with that girl, ho? Phwee ho! Too bad for you, she'll be-ho eaten in hee-no time, ho. Hee ho! Hee ho ho! Is there a brain in that hee-head, ho? Most humans can't see-ho places like this, hee ho. But, you're here-ho, and hee-so am I, ho. It's a mystery, hee ho. The Dark Realm is hee-so temperate.

We never hee-cided where we-ho were going to play, hee ho. Do you hee-know a good place, ho? You're too small, dear. You'll never reach up there. Hmm, the intellectual type, I presume? You're nice-looking, but not my type. I prefer wildcats. You may look short, honey, but you're big where it counts. Too bad you're not my type.  It's an imposing wall.   exhibited the power of flight.   obtained  x1.   pounded against the wall.   obtained . ...!? That dame was dragged into here just up ahead. It's a little out of the way, , but let's go check it out. Well, we're stuck here,  . Let's head back.  Its brain seems to be empty... Was that a breeze I just felt? You might as well stick a feather in your hat and call it macaroni. ...... Hurry up and go home, kiddo. This place is unsafe at any speed. This lightning seal is pretty airtight. You can knock it down, though, if you use a Volt-order demon. If you don't have a Volt-order demon, better go pick one up somewhere, don't you think?  In this version, you do not have to fight a lightning wall.  In the official version, you will only be able to destroy the lightning wall using a demon.  Please bring a Volt order demon here and surpass the wall battle. Well then, let's bring down that wall, . You can't do anything to it yourself, so have a demon attack with force magic, got it? Well, we're stuck here until we find one. Look around; we don't want to hang around here forever. ...... ...... ...... temp message temp message temp message temp message Yestemp message temp message temp message  There is a rift connecting the Real World to the Dark Realm...  Return to the shrine? Yes Raidou performed the ritual of exiting.  Raidou decided to stay.  There is a rift connecting the Real World to the Dark Realm...  Return to the Real World?  Yatagarasu's seal binding the Dark Realm is surrounding the area. temp message temp message  There's nothing here.  Leave? Yes Raidou left.  Raidou gave up. I'm collecting bugs! How 'bout you? Do you collect 'em, too? Yes, I do.You do? But, you don't even have any... Well, if you wanna start, here's how I did it. This is just our secret! The most important things are... Delicious sweets! Gigantic trees! Deserted areas! And, don't forget, it has to be a , or else the bugs just fly away. Good luck! N-No they're not! Bugs are awesome! Whoa! A Stag Beetle! Hey, lemme have it! Please! Sure.Sweet! I'll trade you this for it.  Raidou obtained  x1.   obtained  x1. Awwww! Why not!? Yes! I got a Stag Beetle!  Agathion put the Stag Beetle in his jug. Ow ow ow!  It's biting me...! Jeepers! It's a Beetle! Hey, will you trade me for it!? Sure.Rock! I'll trade you this for it.  Raidou obtained  x1.   obtained  x1. Awwww, why not!? Sweet! I got a Beetle!  Agathion put the Beetle in his jug. I collect all kindsa bugs. Now I can show them off to my friends!  Go to the Akarana Corridor?  Raidou blew the Flute of Rhone.  However, the Large Tarrasque is not in the Dark Realm.  The Herald of Yatagarasu has created a connection between the Real World and the Dark Realm.  It is possible to return to the Nameless Shrine from here. Return to the Real World?  Persons unknown have created a connection between the Real World and the Dark Realm.  It is possible to use it to escape the Dark Realm.  Return to the Real World? YesGuess what? Well, it's no fun if you already know... The light of a full moon makes demons excited. Even little old me becomes a dangerous girl on nights like that. If you want us on your side, you should pay close attention to the phase of the moon.  The phase of the moon affects the timing of when you can confine demons during battle.  Most demons are impossible to confine under a full moon.  If you're trying to gain new allies, pay attention to the phase of the moon. I love looking up at the moon from here. It's so elegant, the way it spins up there. The beautiful moon is full tonight! I'm getting pretty fevered! I'll kill the night away in a ballet of blood! The sweet, sweet cruelty! I'll not be stopped or tamed this night!  The demon has stopped listening to all reason. Hmm? This is...! You've never seen a wall like this before, have you, ? This one's made out of negative waves. It bears a little bit of explaining, so sit tight. Shikimi no Kage. It's not indestructible... But, every attack except its weakness is void. That's what makes it so tricky. On top of that, there are several different types, and they each have a different weakness. The Shikimi no Kage in front of us can be destroyed with a Lightning attack. I know what you're thinking, and I can already tell you: elemental bullets won't work. Gun attacks only work if it's weak against your gun. And, of course, everything else would be useless. So, bringing out the Electric Bullets won't do you any good here. Unless you have a Volt-order demon, this is the end of the line. If that's the case, just run away for now. You can come back later when you've got the right demon. That's about the size of it. Get all that, ? Got it.Let's get to it, then. Don't forget to summon your Volt-order demon. *sigh* Look, this is important, so listen up. Hey, check it out! You really did show up! He said that you would, but I still wasn't sure... ...You don't get it yet, do you? The girl was just bait to lure you into our realm. Meaning... Dinner is served! Who are... you...? Kaya...? Don't worry. Once we bumped off her captor, she was returned to the mortal world. Let's hurry back and speak to that girl. The two of 'em must be close, since she called out Kaya's name while she was unconscious. Let us begin the ritual. Do not let go of the Amatsu Kanagi you were given. This will be the first time I have performed the Ritual of Soul-Sending. The power stored inside the Amatsu Kanagi will allow you to cross the dimensional rift... Chant along with me in your mind, and stay alert... We shall begin...  It's a Dragon Cave.

I just feel that way cos I'm broke. We're all brothers in this great big ball o' dirt. You and me are brothers, too. Should I call you big brother? Or would you prefer just, bro? Why pay for your meals at a fancy-pants ristorante? I can get all the grub and hooch I need rooting around in the trash. An automobile beats a rickshaw any day of the week. A two-wheeled rig just doesn't compare to a four-wheeler! The number of wheels is crucial! That factory over yonder makes silk yarn using hard-workin' silk worms. They don't pay the silk worms, though. Those little bugs should think about forming a union. I've never set foot outside Japan, so I don't have the first idea about what goes on overseas. A guy with a narrow field of vision like mine doesn't need to worry about a huge ocean. Every foreigner's got a different color of skin and his own type of face. My skin's pretty dark for someone born and raised in the Capital, but that's just cos I haven't showered. How come folks here are so  eager to be with foreigners? Don't they know someone from overseas doesn't take easily to a Japanese face? When the police or the Army comes this way, I get pretty nervous. Of course, the harder I try to seem innocent, the less innocent I look... Those louses who order people around when taking photos are all wet. Smile! they bark at you, like some kind of threat. What if I don't, huh? Munakata is Japanese for respectable sculpture. An honorable blockhead, in other words. He's as stubborn as his name! Phones are rotten because you can shout over 'em without caring about the other guy's feelings. It's easy to be a jerk when you don't have to look the other guy in the face. You'll find whatever you're lookin' for as soon as you forget you  were lookin' for it. Life is long. Be patient. When I think of Ginza, the image that comes to mind is pretty dull. I don't even want to tell you what it is. It'll sound pretty stupid. Those that dig pits often fall in. It means if you curse someone, you might end up paying instead. But, everyone hates someone... So the world fills up with pits. Fat cats like high altitudes, and prefer to have top-floor offices. Do you think they know why? I hope so. Only jerks leave notes. You can write anything you want, since you won't be there when they read it. People who issue memos rather than just give orders are the worst. That ball up there is already out of sight. Whoever hit that thing out of the park is pretty impressive. It's a surefire homer. People without any goals in life are idiots. But, the ones who chase their goals without thinking of others are even bigger idiots. We should be grateful to those black ships. If we were still so rude to visitors, who here would have known Russian? Eh? Where'd your cat go? It was a pretty good one, as cats go. Well, he looked pretty fickle, so who knows.

I told you to listen... Jeepers, it seems like the game is really heating up now. I don't need to prepare. I'll do it by sheer force of will. Well, I guess that's one way of thinking about it. Commodore Matthew Perry arrived in Japan in 1853. Oh, great... Now the transmissions are giving me a history lecture. As fickle as a maiden's heart or an autumn sky. Aha... So, all three are fickle. So, if you met a girl with the personality of a cat in early autumn? Triple the fickleness. Seems like the old guy isn't around today. I brought him some food. Maybe he had a late night in the lab again. He sometimes forgets to sleep... Seems the old guy is still asleep. It wasn't easy getting this food over here... I understand he works late doing experiments, but... Oh well, I'll come back later. The old guy's not here today either. I brought him some new clothes. Maybe he had a late night in the lab again. He sometimes forgets to sleep... The old guy's not here today either.

I hardly ever see him anymore. Maybe he had a late night in the lab again. He sometimes forgets to sleep... The old guy's not here today either. I hope he didn't take off somewhere... Nah, there's no way he would leave without finishing his work. Is the Army also working on a project? It's a race to see who'll finish first, the old guy or the military. I wonder if I'll ever see the old guy again. I'm getting lonely. But, I have a feeling I'll see him today. Wow, she's beautiful... Sharp-looking girls with a quick wit are just the old guy's type. I finally saw the old guy! He seems to be in good shape. I'm glad he's doing okay. That old guy hasn't changed one bit. He really loves the dames. He seems to be in good shape. I'm glad he's doing okay. ......  He looks like he wants to say something to you.  The gazing shiba's thoughts can be heard... Well now, what a surprise. A human can hear my words.  Think yesThat's very kind of you. I'll begin... Humans are shaping the future with the technology and convenience of the modern world. But, they've stolen our future from us to build their own... The modern world has no place for us. Mountains stripped bare of trees... Rivers that flow with industrial toxins... I can still remember the faces of my friends who died rather than leave their beloved homes. I grew to hate words because they are the foundation of modern human society, but... Those hated words have also led me to kind humans like you. Maybe someday, all humans will show your kindness... My dream is to return to that forest where I grew up. That dream gives me the strength to stay alive. If you don't mind, could you... share your dream with me?  It's my own fault, really, for expecting anything from you. How tragic... Dreams give us hope to keep on living, for humans and dogs alike. Never forget that... My dream is to return to that forest where I grew up. And I remember your dream is . Dreams give us hope to keep on living, for humans and dogs alike. Never forget that... I always see you traveling with humans. Don't they scare you? Humans are selfish creatures. You'll find yourself in trouble one day. Think yes...Are you starting to remember? I warn you now, run away before it's too late. I see... then, you haven't seen it for yourself. Humans have stolen our homes, and our future. I won't forget what they've done to us. I used to look down on my friends who were raised by humans... But, when I see you and your human together... Maybe I can get along with them, too. Tell me... do you have a dream?   didn't understand the concept of dream. I see. Well, don't worry; it will come to you eventually. Dreams give us the hope to keep on living. For humans, dogs, and even you. Never forget that.  is your dream? After discussing it with you, I feel that my dream is a certainty. I'll remember this day... Remember my dream, and yours as well.  ...Wind velocity, gravity... humidity... So many factors...! Is this worth it, Raidou? I don't think anybody's home. Um... Excuse me... ...Eh? Oh ho! Hi there, pretty girl! What is it? Why are you here? I can tell you anything you want to know about rockets and space travel! First thing's first... You need to know there's no oxygen in space. This, of course, makes it difficult for human beings to survive on their own. Which is to say, in other words-- I'm sorry, um... Doctor, but... We wanted to ask you some different questions. ...What? You didn't come to learn about space? Actually, no. We'd like to hear what you know about a statue called the Irie Fudou. ...The Irie Fudou, eh? ...Yes, I remember! It was placed at a beach long, long ago... It's, uh, where Ginza-Cho is now. Honest Ainu! I heard all about it as a child... ...So, why'd you wanna know? Ginza-Cho, huh? ...No rest for the weary. Might be a good idea to ask that doll from the paper. She knows all kinds of stuff no normal person has any business knowing. ...H-Hey, wait! Where are you off to in such a hurry? I haven't explained rocket propulsion yet! Let's pass the time with a little pop quiz... When I point straight up, what am I pointing to? SpaceSpoken like an honor student! Which is to say, technically correct and dull as dishwater. You'll never achieve escape velocity if you don't show some creativity. ...I've asked a lot of people, but you're the first one to give that answer. I'll store that one away in the ol' think tank. You're not the first to answer that way. The other ones all said it with a smirk, though. They were trying way too hard to be snazzy and modern. That's the death of creativity. A curse? Well, all right, if that's the sort of thing you're interested in. For me, it's all about physics. I'm only interested in what you can calculate, measure, and predict. With electromagnetic radiation, we can broadcast information quickly over a wide radius. In the future, even newspapers and magazines will go out over those electromagnetic waves. Wh-What? You traveled back and forth from the past? But, that's exactly Dr. Einstein's... Theory of relativy, right?That's right! It's Einstein's theory, but if I account for Earth's gravity as a distortion of space-time... Well, the day isn't far off when even regular people can take little trips through history. After all, I've got my experiments, and you'll do very well as a live test subject... No, no! That's Schrodinger! I know you like cats, but don't joke around! Physics is serious business! Oh... ghosts, huh. Well, have fun with your spiritual studies. You won't get anywhere without the math to back you up. Ghost stories won't even feed your cat... There was a successful rocket launch, and it wasn't even mine! This is a good sign, though... If even the military dunderheads can do it, it's child's play for me! The satellite is almost nonexistent compared to the vastness of space. It's like throwing darts blindfolded. You can't launch your rocket at random, or you'll definitely miss. If I knew this would happen, I would have taken my language studies more seriously... I'm counting on you to find a Russian speaker. I don't get out often enough, you see... I'm sorry about the rocket mishap... But, you saw it, right? My rocket! It really flew! I'm feeling a little greedy now! I think next time, I'll go up there myself! He gained the indulgence of his passion at the price of his social standing. He may be one of the only truly free men in the Capital. Discussing one's dream and realizing it are two very different things. I can sympathize with the desire to discover virgin territory... as long as it doesn't affect me. I'm busy right now, kid! Whaddya want? Can it wait? You saw that giant robot tearing the Capital apart, didn't you? Our city's going to be rubble in no time at all. So! I'm going to hit that ugly mug with my rocket and smash it to smithereens! So get a move on! You're in my way! ...Interesting idea, but would a rocket be enough to take that colossus down? Wouldn't the rocket be put to better use destroying the satellite? .  Raidou informed Dr. Tsukumo that the satellite served as the Soulless God's power source. What!? The satellite is siphoning power into that monster? ...And you want to use my rocket to destroy the satellite. That's inconceivable! Hitting a satellite that's floating in space with an unmanned rocket!? It's not even possible! Without knowing precise data-- the satellite's orbit, speed, etcetera-- it can't be done! Besides, even if we COULD hit it, there's no guarantee it would be destroyed! ...Looks like we only get one shot at this, . We have to find a way to get the data he wants. ...And, we have to do it before this sap wastes the rocket on the Soulless God itself. ...Who do you think might have an inside link to the Army? ...I'm still busy, you meddling kid! Come back later, I said!  Raidou handed Dr. Tsukumo the SS Project Report. ...Huh? What's this? I say! This is a report on that satellite of yours! It shows the blueprint, power source, mass, output capacity... This has everything about it! Hrm... Tsiolkovski's Equation... I had heard a rumor that a Russian scientist developed a rocket theory. ...Does this mean they used his research to launch the satellite? ...Assuming so, I could use this equation to launch my own rocket into space, but... Wouldn't you know, it's written in Russian. I can't read a word of it! ...Even if I had a way to read it, this indicates the satellite is heavily armored. I'm certain my rocket wouldn't be able to destroy it, anyway. It seems our luck's run out. The rocket might not destroy the satellite, but it'd get us close enough to do the job. We could destroy the satellite ourselves, as long as we had a way to reach it, right? First things first, though--do we know any Russians? ...Or, at least someone who knows how to read Russian? What about that Victor guy? He's from another country, right? He might know Russian. ...Oh, you still want the equation? Are you going to find someone who can read it? ...I suppose it's better than just giving up. All right, here you go. But, be quick about it! No use stopping that monster if it's already burned down the Capital! Any luck, kid? Did you solve the equation?  Raidou relayed Rasputin's message to Dr. Tsukumo. ...That's an oversight. I made my rocket too heavy for its power output. All right! By three o'clock, this baby will be ready and raring to go! Flying to space, just like one of those science fiction serials. Space travel, eh? I guess I should feel honored to have seen this day. But, we know that rocket can't destroy the satellite. Rasputin mentioned that control unit inside Tai-itsu... Any ideas on how to handle that development? I'll destroy it myself. Raidou informed Dr. Tsukumo that he intended to board the rocket. ...Buh? What are you saying!? Space is a vacuum! There isn't any oxygen--at all! You'd die in a second! . You'll have to send a demon.  Raidou told Gouto he would be sending a demon on the rocket. It's probably for the best. If we send a demon up in the rocket, it should be able to take care of the satellite. , the rocket can't destroy the satellite, can it? How do you intend to destroy it, then? You... You're not going to go up there yourself, are you!? ...There's no way that's going to work, Raidou. I'm busy here with the rocket modifications... ...You need to decide how you're going to handle that satellite. Phew... I think we're all set! My imagination is about to be realized! . I'll report back frequently... ...so you can command your demon from here. Got it? ...I hope this works.  Gouto and the demon entered the rocket. Might as well choose a demon now, then. I'll be going up with it, in case anything goes wrong. Don't you worry about me... After all, I'm not a real cat, so I should be just fine. We don't know anything about outer space... ...or what might happen to your demon out there. So, make sure it's fully prepared for what it's about to go through. Now... which one of our friends is going to be my traveling companion? ...You don't have any demons with you, ? What kind of Devil Summoner are you, anyway? Get it in gear!  on board? Yes.  climbed into the rocket. ...Well then, it's time to become the first cat in space. *sigh* We don't really have time for joking around right now. Once you've figured it out, tell Dr. Tsukumo. ? Okay, which demon is going on the rocket? ...And so, the Capital narrowly escaped total destruction. Let's go make sure that monster is down for the count, Raidou. You're an agent now too. Primary objective: accomplish the mission at any cost. ...Relax, I'm just razzing you. I know you don't have it in you to put your buddy and your demon in danger. I've accepted my fate....When you're right, you're right. But, I want nothing but smiling faces when this is all over. Tae, the owner of Ryugu, Satake, Sadakichi... and Kaya, of course. You're full of surprises, Raidou. I used to think you were a real stick in the mud, but... looks like my winning personality is rubbing off. I must say, that was quite a spectacle! You've helped me realize my ultimate goal of launching a rocket into space! What's the matter, kid? We stopped that monster, didn't we? Why the sour puss? ...... It isn't finished, is it? Don't worry. Whatever it is, I know you can take care of it. When that monster showed up and started causing trouble... ...you were the only person besides me who tried to stop it. Be brave, and have faith in yourself. We launched a rocket into space! Anything is possible.  The Amatsu Kanagi began to glow in response to Tsukumo's words. It has something to do with that girl, doesn't it? Since the dawn of time, men have been motivated by one thing... You do your best, and I'm sure everything'll work out. Looks like the Amatsu Kanagi is gaining power. ...Still not enough, though. We still need more power, . Move on to another person. You'll need to perform the ritual at Ushigome-gaeri Bridge. The game's afoot, Raidou! Let's settle this once and for all! Those homeless bums look dirty, but they're some of the only  freethinking people in this burg. I'd love to stop and interview this one, but... we really gotta get to Kasumidai.  It's a Dragon Cave. Mysterious power is flowing out of it...  Here, Raidou can record his findings without being disturbed.  Save? Yes Recover health? Yes  and his demons were healed. *sob* *sob* ...Who are you? I've never seen you around here... I'm Nakisawame. I heal everyone... *sob* Welcome. *sob* Welcome. It's a full moon, so... Do you want me to heal you? Yes yen... Is that okay? YesThis may sting a little, but only for a moment...   and his demons were healed.   was healed. *sob* Don't die on me... Please... *sob* So... You're going to die, too... You don't have enough money... *sob* So... You'll die just like all the rest...  Leave the area? Yes It's an elevator.  It looks like humans are unable to reach inside and take the contents.  It's a glowing, red crystal.  The contents inside shift and warp.

Not while Major General Munakata is on-site... Waden One has a direct view of us, and if I get caught talking...! ? Lucky us, the big cheese is home and everything. Course, with Munakata around, there's bound to be Special Guards as well. We have to face them head on.I know you're all goofy on danger, but that's suicide, . The Army may be well-trained, but they're still just humans; you can't use your demons on 'em. Fighting with normal weapons would take time, and that's time Munakata can use to escape. A wise man once said, Less haste, more speed. It's not as direct, but using the Dark Realm is safer. Taking the long way to surprise 'em, huh? Probably a safe bet. After all, you can't use your demons against human beings. Sneaking through the Dark Realm will be faster than trying to take them head on. . We'll infiltrate that tower via the Dark Realm.  You may now enter . I thought I finally found a good replacement base... But I got kicked out again, just like the factory at Senju. Awww, man... I just wanna be like Satake... Well, I'm not gonna give up! This is our base. I won't mess up again. Satake wouldn't mess up, right? I finally found a good replacement base, but... I'm the boss, and I have to protect my lackeys. At times like this, I ask myself: what would Satake do?  The wannabe kid's spirit was rekindled. This is our replacement base! Cause I said so! Army, my butt! Those stuck-up jerks! What's so great about grown-ups!? No! I'm not going home! I'm not budging an inch! This is our base! It's the Army who should leave! I'm not going home! I'm not moving from this spot! My base will be right here! ...But, my lackey is getting scared. I'm the boss... What would Satake do...? We came from our old base at the factory in Senju to find a new base. Boss taught me how to take the train. Boss knows everything! Boss is the berries. He doesn't back down, even when the Army men get angry. So, I've got to... I've got to do my best! I'm Boss's lackey, after all... What was that round thingie? It was loud... I-I'm scared... Boss... I wanna go home...!  The pure and innocent girl's spirit was rekindled. That soldier called us stupid, but he's the stupid one! Stuck-up soldiers make me so mad! Boss is trying hard! So I have to try hard, too!! ...But, that round thing... It was scary. I want to go home... The view of the Capital from the mountaintop used to be lovely. If the mountain has a soul, I'll bet it weeps to see the Army building that thing on top of it. Radio waves come from that weird-looking tower, right? Even if this radio thing is so popular... It doesn't do much to improve the mountain. Oh, my. That little angel over there looks like she's about to cry, the poor thing. She must have been scared to death by that thing flying through the air... Both the Army and a detective are here, and they don't do anything but grumble. They're so useless, it makes me want to cry! Huh? Did you say you'll do something about that monster? Even if you're only saying so on my account, bless you. Those men could learn a thing or two from you. I don't know how much longer I've got, but I plan on coming here until the day I die. There's no reason for it; this is simply where Sakuradayama is. Sometimes the heart has no reason. That tower is so striking! Just looking at it gives me power. Men are such pigs! I'm through with them! From now on, that tower is my new lover! That radio tower is wonderful! It's my new crush. With five pulsing towers around the Capital, who needs men anymore! The radio tower just flashed, and birthed a bunch of babies. I thought it would replace men, but it was just a woman. My heart is broken... Ohhh! That soldier kept his resolve even through his incontinence... I think I'm in love. The tower is a place where matches are made... It's true! It's true!  The captivated lady's eyes are glued onto Raidou... Ohhhh, what is this...? I thought I'd abandoned flesh-and-blood men! When I see you, I know I can't lie to myself anymore! Ohhh... When I say I don't need men... I lied. I want real love! I'll turn my back on that tower if you'll become my lover! Ohhh! Love is the best remedy for a broken heart! That's just common sense all over the globe! I'll never think of that tower again if you'll be my lover! You're an attractive young man... But, I've already promised my love... ...to that soldier who's emptied his bladder. Please, this promise will be hard enough without you tempting me. A place where matches are made... A place to increase potency... The civilians are spreading some odd rumors. Imagine, calling the Army's source of morale... *snicker* Waden One is the source of the Army's morale, and a cornerstone of our project. The way it points to the heavens symbolizes our desire to improve! Take a good look! *snicker* The launch of the Tai-itsu satellite is a source of the Army's morale, and a cornerstone of our project. Take a good look at it, as well as Waden... *snicker* U-Unlike you civilians, we're prepared! ...And for your information, this is... sweat! It's sweat! The stain on my pants is definitely sweat! Wh-What? You have a plan to beat that monster? Don't joke around like that! Anyway... I-If you have spare pants, hand 'em over... W-Waden One tower is the source of our morale! I mean, sure, the circumstances around my pants aren't perfect, but... I won't be beaten!!  The Sakuradayama Army soldier's thoughts can be heard... The civilian ideas are so vulgar... Seeing Waden One as THAT... Aw, hell... Now the image is stuck in my head. I-I can't look at it  with a straight face... Hahahah! The more I look at it... Aw, hell... Now the image is stuck in my head. I-I can't look at it with a straight face... Hahahah! Did the architect not notice or something..? Why does it have to be shaped like... Th-The earthquake was huge! And then there's that monster...! Wh-Who wouldn't piss their pants at a time like this!? Even I lost control of my bladder at the sight of that thing! Wh-What can a mere high school student do!? That foreign woman there is staring at me... N-No! She didn't notice that I peed my pants when I saw that monster, did she!? Calm down... She can't have noticed. My acting skills are the best in the Army! Please! Go away! Listen to me, just this once! And take those stupid kids with you! Why doesn't anyone listen to me!? Civilians, police, no one is allowed in here! Dammit, don't snicker at me! I'm not moving from this spot! Why doesn't anyone listen to me!? This area is off-limits to civilians! Who gives a damn about a kid's play fort!? Crying won't get you anywhere. This is my post! Th-Those kids left... I know I yelled at them earlier..  But, I-I couldn't run away in front of them... I'd look stupid. Th-Those kids left... I know I yelled at them earlier..  But, I-I couldn't run away in front of them... I'd look stupid. E-Even if there's a monster, this checkpoint is my post! So... I-I'll stand my ground! No one shall pass!!  The radio tower inspector's thoughts can be heard... Come on, gimme a break... Major General Munakata's here. There's a clear view of here from the top floor of the tower. If he saw me now...! ...I bet it was you again, huh? No doubt you're to blame for the ruckus at Waden One. Aah, that's okay. I'll let it slide. Go raise hell for those Army cadet punks. Major General Munakata's super weapons are pretty darn strong, of course, but... Their best feature is the way they never run out of power. They say that satellite sends a constant stream of energy to the weapons down here. It sounded like a bunch of bull to me, but after seeing that... If that monster has an unlimited amount of energy, like Major General Munakata said... Then it's not gonna stop until the whole world is stomped flat... How the hell do you stop something with an unlimited amount of energy!? I have a way. Leave it to me.Y-You gotta be kidding! What can one junior P.I. do against a monster like that...!? Geez, what's wrong with me? I'm a gumshoe! I can't let a private detective outdo me! You run along and wait with Narumi at the office. The police will handle the rest! Y-You pickin' a fight with me!? Whaddaya want ME to do against a monster like that!? Nothing good comes from pickin' a fight you can't win.  Detective Kazama's spirit was rekindled. Inspector, my ass! Damn rookie cadet, bossing me around! I've been booking scum in this Capital since he was still in his mama's womb! Satellite, shmatellite! Pickin' a fight with an army to back you up... I'm not havin' any of that! I tell ya, a fight isn't anyone's business except the fighters! They pick a fight, you give 'em three times what they asked for! That was my motto when I was young. ...But, a monster that big, it's not like I can poke its eyes or give it a knee to the groin! I'm not stupid enough to try to take that lummox head-on! But, I ain't so dainty that I'll sit off to the side, twiddling my thumbs! I got my own way of fighting. Not with my fists... With my feelings! ...... ...Wha--!? Oh! It's you, Raidou! Hey, you really look different. You look like a man now. ...I used to be the leader of the local gang of punks. But, now I'm sporting this cherry blossom crest, workin' on the side of the law. Even though I'm using cuffs instead of my fists, I still hate crooked people. I decided to become a flatfoot cause I can be myself... with what little brains I got. You've got the same eyes I did when I was young: reckless, yet straightforward. ...Take this, will ya? When you get to be my age, make sure to keep that sparkle in your eyes.  Raidou obtained the . Even if... radios are popular...

You there... Another of the lost ones who grope for the abyss. Were I to ask what motivates you, why you continue to live... You would offer naught but silence. Instead, my question is thus: do you come here, to the abyss, to seek an audience with me? Yes, that's right.I see. Nevertheless, if you wish to meet face-to-face, you must present certain credentials. You do not possess them now...

I wasn't expecting to see you. Is Mr. Narumi overworking you? Maybe a raise is in order, hm? Oh, me? I'm here because I was born and raised in Harumi-Cho.  Co.? It's actually my family's business. I quit to start my job at Ryugu, and left Harada  Co. to my big brother, but... Six months ago, he died. ...Sank to the bottom of the sea along with his cargo. Naturally, they asked me to take over for him. But, there are so many strange things happening lately. It's frustrating, we think all the monster business is over after Ginza-Cho, and now... ...Sorry, I didn't mean to ramble on like that. So, what brings you here? I assume you aren't sightseeing.Ask about Konnou-Ya's cargoIf there's anything you want to know, just ask. Raidou explained that he came to Harumi-Cho to help Konnou-Ya's owner. That old man actually left his store to ask for help? Yes, he's been a loyal customer of ours for some time. I'm fully aware that this has been a great inconvenience for Konnou-Ya, but... ...We did send out a ship, just recently. If we're lucky, he'll receive his order soon. If not... Konnou-Ya will shut down, and our reputation will follow it.  Raidou asked about Rasputin. ...Rasputin? Never heard that name before, sorry.  Raidou asked her to elaborate on strange things. ...Ahh, no wonder you came to Harumi-Cho. Starting six months ago, right after my brother died, our cargo started disappearing. We assumed it was stolen, so we posted sailors as guards. ...And it happened again, only this time it was the sailors who disappeared. We have witnesses. Supposedly, the sailors vanished into thin air. But, the police won't believe it! Not even with the sailors missing and unaccounted for! Those men risked their lives and braved the sea to deliver that cargo! And it just vanishes! ...I feel as though I've shamed my family and our business. Well... No new dirt on Rasputin. But, at least her story matches up with what Konnou-Ya told us. Time to go back to the detective agency and plan our next move, . Eee hee hee... Thanks for working so hard on my case. Mr. Narumi already told me that the next ship is scheduled to bring my merchandise. I just finished going over the details with Ms. Harada. She's confident that I'll receive my merchandise at last. It's just off the coast, and they're unloading the cargo as we speak. Maybe I can finally sleep peacefully tonight... ...We're not in the clear just yet, though. I won't believe any of it until I see the cargo with my own two eyes. If worse comes to worst... I'm not sure what I'll do. We're through the worst of it. It shouldn't take too long to unload; we'll just need to be patient a little longer. ...W-We've got a problem! The cargo's gone again, and the sailors--! They vanished too? 'fraid so. Three sailors and the cargo just up and disappeared. Now you see 'em, now you don't. But, I used money from the store to arrange for that delivery... ...I'm very sorry. It didn't work out after all. No! This can't be happening! Can't you do something, Raidou!? ...I can't stand seeing people cry. We really should give them a hand. If things are disappearing from this world... ...where do you suppose they're going to?  You may now enter . The missing sailors are back and they're all doing fine. They said a student in a black cape saved them... The cargo is back, too, without even a scratch. ...I should be thanking you, I presume? Leave it to the Narumi Detective Agency to solve this kind of problem.  Co. is back on its feet! We fulfilled Konnou-Ya's order and everything. ...Because of you. Thank you so much, Raidou. ...... I heard from Satake that you're investigating Mr. Elfman. I just want you to know that he's changed... He didn't used to be this way. Elfman and my brother were good friends. It's hard not to think of him that way. Heh, he always told me he wanted a younger sister, since he was an only child, growing up. But, I haven't seen him since I left to take over Ryugu. I started hearing bad things about Elfman shortly after my brother passed away. He supposedly helped foreigners stay in Japan illegally and started roughing-up our merchants. Of course, I didn't believe it. I went to see him and he slammed the door in my face. I know you have your reasons, so I won't ask why you want to find him. But, you should know that it could be months before he grants you an appointment. ...Still, I'll do anything I can to help you out. You did save my company. Elfman gave me a gift the day before I started at Ryugu. He told me it was a lucky charm to guarantee safety at sea. ...If you show them this and mention Harada, they should treat you well. If you're lucky, they'll even let you in to see him.  Raidou obtained the . Guess we're off to find Elfman, then. I hope this isn't just another dead end. Hopefully we'll come up with a way to track Rasputin down. Elfman's been living out of a Catholic church in this area. He rarely ever leaves though, so your best bet is to go there to find him. ...It's across the water, and I'm afraid he's destroyed the boat you'd need to get there. I'm at a loss for how you might reach him, but I doubt he'll ever come to you. Traveling across water...? Are you thinking about the same demon I am, ? Suggest Large Tarrasque Raidou suggested Large Tarrasque. Yeah, that big demon from the underground seems like just the ticket. Unless you can walk on water now, our best bet is Large Tarrasque. I say we try to level with him.  Raidou suggested Azumi. ...Azumi, huh? Well, she does live along the shore. But, I think this job's a little bit beyond Azumi. ? Cats aren't too keen on water.  A ghost is staring at the ground, a telling look on his face.  There appears to be something buried here.  Unearth it? Yes Raidou began to dig as Gouto looked on, amused.  Raidou uncovered a skeleton! It looks like this is all that remains... Maybe we could figure this out if we listened to the voices of the dead, hm?  Raidou listened to the ghost. ...I'll never forgive him... Someone... Hear me out... Oh! You can hear what I'm saying!? I was killed by a strange man. He said he had plans to take over my trading business. He... was going to use my name. ...He wanted to impersonate me. So the culprit killed him and then took his identity? Wouldn't people close to the ghost know something was up? . How do we find someone who isn't himself? Suggest ElfmanThat's the ticket! People did say Elfman was acting strangely, didn't they? But, does that make this Elfman's skeleton? Rasputin? Why would a Dark Summoner need to assume someone else's identity? I was leaning more toward the foreign merchant. , I'm not here to hold your hand. But, since I already have figured it out--why not the foreign merchant? Yes, my name was Elfman. The one calling himself Elfman now is an imposter. This situation might be more grave than we anticipated. How do we know this ghost is really him, though? Do we have anything he might recognize at all? ...Perhaps an item of some sort? Something important to the real Elfman? Present the Ring of Memories Raidou held the Ring of Memories. That... That ring...! It's the ring I gave her! ...Harada's sister... It was a going away present. How did you get it...? ...Looks like he's the real McCoy. What does he have to say? The... the strange man murdered me... ...He's at the church. ...Please... avenge my death...  The ghost quietly disappeared. ...So if the real Elfman is dead, then who is the imposter really? .  Raidou held the Flute of Rhone.  However, the ghost did not react in the slightest. ...I can't imagine why you thought that had anything to do with our spiritual friend. Try again, detective.  A ghost is staring at the skeleton knowingly.  What item will you show him? ...I can hear a voice. I don't see anybody, though. Maybe he's hiding?  A man can be heard speaking in the confessional. ...I have not forgotten. Rest assured, I will carry out my assigned duty. I'm still trying to pinpoint the anomaly and investigate what exactly caused it. Yes, leave it to me. I'll make sure history returns to its natural course at any cost. *sigh* ...Heh, they really think I'm going to do everything just as I was told. Don't treat me like a doll; I have plans of my own. . Let's take a gander. ...What? Empty!? So then... What brought you here in the first place? Ohhh... You came here looking for Mr. Elfman.YesCan't argue with that logic; that's why you're the detective. As I'm sure you already know, Mr. Elfman is no longer of this world. Killing him was an unfortunate necessity if I was to gain his influence and wealth. ...Oh, don't give me that look. I've done things to expand his trade business he never would have thought of. If he could see me from hell, I'm sure he'd be proud. Bah ha ha ha ha... Isn't there anything else you wanted to talk about? ...... ...You wanted me to explain what I told you about the factory? Like I said, I'm impressed you tracked me all the way here. For that, you deserve an explanation. So... Kaya Daidouji... You'd like to know her whereabouts too, I'd imagine. Right now, Kaya is working in . She needs to complete the , you see. I'm part of it, as well... ...as security, to eliminate those who know too much. I want to emphasize, this isn't personal. You just happen to be on their blacklist. You are after Kaya, you see. I assume they don't want a gumshoe snooping around the project. Considering you got all the way here, I can't say their concern is unfounded. ...I think we've had better fights, but look at this... He's some kind of mechanical doll... thing... What's really going on? At least we came out on top. Perhaps we should leave it at that for now. Narumi needs to hear what we've learned about Kaya. Sorry, but I'm really swamped right now. I can't help you. Sorry about that, Raidou. You should've told me you were going back to the Detective Agency. I was going to ask you to tell Narumi that I haven't forgotten about his tab. We lost everything... I'm sorry to have to tell you, Sir. Tell Elfman I sent you, and show him the ring. He'll remember me. Elfman has been dead for how long!? Th-Then who's that in the Catholic Church right now...? Raidou! You've got to help save my shipment! If something happens to that cargo... I'll be ruined! It'll be the end of Konnou-Ya! You're one of my best customers, aren't you? What would you do if I went out of business, huh? We're on our way to Kasumidai, the Army's home sweet home. This here is Harumi-Cho, the Navy HQ. I can see where you might get confused... But, time's a-wasting, Raidou. Clear those cobwebs and get a wiggle on. Humanity often professes to wish for peace. No individual, if asked, would express a desire to stand in the way of peace. It's easy to say such things, but what is peace? Can anyone answer? Can you? Without the resolve to face the implications of peace, it can never be truly achieved.  The Yomi-kugutsu left. So... those monsters finally started attacking people. They're pretty hard-boiled if even trained soldiers can't take 'em down. We should look for any survivors, to gather information.  He died in battle with the Yomi-kugutsu... Raidou Kuzunoha! You're all right. ...We lost contact with you after you infiltrated Waden One... We assumed you'd fallen victim to Munakata, and gave up hope. It's... a relief to see you again. You want to know what happened? Heh... Join the club. Those Special Guard soldiers ambushed us after we lost contact with you. They're... inhuman--a swarm of the dead who attack no matter how many slugs you put into 'em. ...We had no choice but to abandon the naval base, and we left this area in order to protect the Admiral. I was concerned, so I returned here, but... Why did you come here? Have you seen Mr. Narumi? ...... You haven't, then. I saw him a few days ago, and he was in an awful state over what he assumed Munakata had done. We all assumed the worst, see. He had plans to follow Munakata from Waden One to the underground facility. But, now you're here, and we're all worried about Mr. Narumi. That blockhead went to settle things on his own. He may not be the brightest bulb in the box, but we can't just abandon him, . But, before we can save his bacon, we need to figure out where he's at. We might have missed some clues back at the detective agency. ...It's you, Raidou! What on earth is going on here!?  Raidou explained the Super Soldier Project to Sadakichi. So, that's what Munakata was trying to achieve... Is the Capital really done for? There's no way to stop that thing? ...What? A satellite, huh? I don't know how much this will help, but I can give you the information I collected for the Navy.  Raidou obtained the . Those are all the files we confiscated in our investigation... ...including a detailed report on the Tai-itsu satellite. A little bit above my head, though, to be honest. I'm going to go ahead and say we're counting on you with this one, Raidou. You have to protect the Capital from that Soulless God. The phone booth at Cannon Battery #4 is useless now. After you snuck in, Munakata disabled it. Are there any other entrances?The facility was designed symmetrically from right to left, so... There should be another way in somewhere. Unfortunately, I don't have any information for you other than that. If we knew someone on the inside of their operations, maybe... But, who...? I've been wondering about him... Is Narumi his real name? It's just that I knew someone in the Army once who looked very similar. I must be mistaken, though. The man I knew couldn't be alive today. I know this sounds unusual, coming from me, but... I hope Mr. Narumi is safe. I'm somewhat surprised that Rasputin would give up a secret entrance... Who is he really?Grigori Yefimovich Rasputin. He claims to be Russian, though the only man with that name is confirmed dead. He worked as a spy for Munakata, doing surveillance and the occasional assassination. He seems unpredictable, but there's a definite method to his madness. That's all I was able to determine, but I suspect he's also involved in the occult. You're correct, of course. I would offer our assistance, but as things stand, I can't... Please accept the Navy's apology. The whirlwind sucked all the heat from the fires into one place, igniting the atmosphere. The impact of the blast has leveled Harumi-Cho! How bad is it?There was no property damage, but some people have died of heatstroke... Have you seen the tragedy at the shipyards? Some unfortunate people dived into the ocean, desperate to escape the heat. This can't go on much longer... Harumi-Cho is... I mean, the Capital will...! Destroying the source of its power? That's a sound plan. Without its endless supply of energy, it's nothing but a decrepit old battleship. This calamity began with one person's desire to alter history. You're going to pursue her, right? Raidou, if you catch up with her... what will you do? She must be defeated.You're Kuzunoha Raidou through and through. I wonder, will you beat her as part of the mission, or of your own desire for battle? Whichever it is... Young adults turning into blood- thirsty warriors... ...In the end, it's we in the military who are to blame. I'm sorry, Raidou. Now, that's what I wanted to hear! You may be Raidou, but you haven't forgotten that you are also . Show her your true strength! The strength that will save her and the Capital! ...In the end, that demon got what he was after. Half the Capital is gone. God only knows how many lives were lost in the attack. But, we did manage to stop it. It's the best anyone could hope for, given our limitations. Let's leave it at that, eh Raidou? It seems altering history is no simple task! I didn't expect you to defeat the Soulless God Oumagatsu. WHAT!? Another one!? I will accept defeat here in Taisho 20, Raidou the 14th... ...But, as long as I have the Soulless God, I will fight to change the course of history forever! The present may be lost, but the future holds infinite possibilities to accomplish my goal! What on earth is going on!? Kaya disappeared with that monster... The future? ...Change the course of history? You came from Yarai-Ku? Long trip, wasn't it? If you've come all this way, it would be a shame not to visit the naval headquarters. Just go up that hill right there, and you can't miss it. Once, we found a body floating in the water that was so mutilated, some of us vomited from the sight. I can't imagine a person who's capable of an atrocity like that... The damage was inhuman. In the private sector, Elfman is the boss. We have no jurisdiction if someone is killed. Isn't he just a merchant, though? How did he get so tight with the authorities? I better not go to Kasumidai while I'm wearing this uniform. The Army doesn't take kindly to Navy soldiers. They still carry a grudge that started between the two forces long, long ago. The Army veterans don't like us because of past grudges, and I understand that... What disgsusts me are the noncoms acting the same way just to imitate the veterans! General Munakata is reputed to be very intelligent, and commands a lot of trust from his subordinates. They say he's a man who believes actions speak louder than words. You look like a popular guy. You going steady with anyone? You should bring her here if you get the chance. It's a fabulous dating spot. Is that girl your sweetheart? Nah, you don't have to be coy about it. She's pretty cute. I have to say, I'm a little jealous. Is that your girlfriend? Don't take this the wrong way, but that stare of hers gives me the willies. Better not have any quarrels with that one. I can tell she'd become a she-devil if you upset her. The admiral had a breakdown because of a curse... How are we supposed to fight a curse? Can't we do anything but watch him suffer? Waden One is... Well, see for yourself. It's that tower over by the mountains. If you have to go there, leave by way of the naval headquarters and head for Sakuradayama. I-I saw the Special Guards in red uniforms... They're here, in Harumi-Cho... Never mind me, what about the civilians? Is the naval headquarters safe? I-I see... The naval headquarters was... Well... At least no civilians were injured or killed. How could a military leader seek power at the expense of the people he's supposed to protect? That's not how a real soldier acts. Munakata is a discredit to his profession. First the Special Guards in the red uniforms attack... Now a monster, and an earthquake? W-We must keep Harumi-Cho's civilians safe at all costs! Fortunately, the tornado weapon takes time to recharge... If it could be used repeatedly,  it would wipe out all of Harumi- Cho. Maybe all of Koutou-Ku! There's no time to rest. That monster could reappear at any moment. We'll have to swallow our pride and request backup from the Army. They should realize that now is the time to put aside our differences. The naval headquarters isn't that strict, really. You're free to enjoy yourself, as long as you don't fool around. Foreigners living here without papers? Gosh... that's illegal. You didn't hear it from me, but there are illegal immigrants all over. It's a real problem. They're probably counterfeiting their visas, but we can't spare the men to hunt them down. They call it the Catholic Church, but it's really more or less Elfman's house. No one except him is allowed to enter. What kind of a church is that? I hear lots of nasty rumors as a soldier... Oh, I'm not supposed to repeat them to civilians... sorry. A lot of soldiers right now are planning to... Oh, I'm not supposed to repeat that to civilians... sorry. You know, those warships that supposedly protect the country really interfere with the... Oh, I'm not supposed to repeat that to civilians... sorry. After the mishaps at the Catholic Church, Harumi-Cho is back to normal. I think I'll go swimming. Just float there on the water, not a care in the world... Peacetime is pretty boring for a soldier. We don't have anything to do. But, I wouldn't trade our peace in just for a little excitement. Even if it means I lose my job... Peacetime is pretty boring for a soldier. We don't have anything to do. On the other hand, if a war breaks out, then whole cities could be destroyed... I read Sadakichi's report from Kasumidai. He mentions something about an underground shipyard... What's the Army up to with those old scrapped battleships? You put your own life on the line to save our Admiral. Not just anyone would do a thing like that. Me and the rest of the men are incredibly grateful. You're a credit to your country. ...S-Sadakichi's report... The army of undead... S-Stop Munakata... please... Y-You must stop... Munakat... ...... ......  The soldier has passed away. ......  The soldier has passed away.  The gunshot to his stomach proved fatal...  The openhearted Navy soldier's thoughts can be heard... There was that one time when we accepted bribes from other countries... That's no way to repay the citizens' trust in us. I was ashamed to be a soldier... I did hear we have a mole in Kasumidai... But, I didn't think it would become such public knowledge... I was hoping to see eight battleships and eight cruisers in active use, but... It would have been a strain on the people to raise taxes for warship construction. In the end, the government made the right call in scrapping the battleships. Isn't my boyfriend so tall and slender? He's so swanky, he could be a model! Just standing next to him makes me the center of attention. My boyfriend was shocked to hear about the shipyard incident. He got all teary-eyed, just like a little kid. It was so cute! My boyfriend still can't get over that shipyard incident. He gets all teary-eyed, just like a little kid. It was so cute! They caught some foreigner red-handed with no papers. My boyfriend would never do anything like that. Because, well, he's my boyfriend. Those bulls think the worst about every foreigner now. Well, my man's innocent! How much more obvious can it be? He's my boyfriend! You know, you're pretty cute too, and that's not just a line. But, I'll go for rare imported goods over ordinary, off-the-shelf domestics any day. That schoolgirl looks pretty keen. Though, anyone looks good when they're that young. A woman's true measure is only revealed later! My boyfriend's been stealing looks at that schoolgirl. That dame's with you, right? Tell her not to get any ideas about my man. The Navy soldiers have been on constant shifts lately. I wish they'd go away. Their uniforms spoil the nice view of the ocean. As soon as the Navy calmed down, the Army started to mobilize. Army is such an ugly word... I can't enjoy the nice view of the ocean as long as they're around. Sheesh, there's a cigarette burn on my dress! The military better reimburse me for this! Plus extra for damages! This whole mess is the Army's fault? The military is out of control! I'm going to write to my local representative about this! W-Wow... Isn't he from Italy? For an Italian, he doesn't have much of an accent. My boyfriend is the berries! He can eat natto even though he's Italian! ...Wait a second. He's not Italian at all! H-He's another Japanese! I'm pretty steamed that he lied to me all this time about being a foreigner, but... We did have some good times together... and isn't that what really counts? I sorry... I forgotting to... talk right. Should I... run? Is everything... all... right? Is it safe... for foreigner... now? Japan police... scary... Scary. M-My country is... good place. I... good person... also. My home...town? Uh... I...  let me... think. I-I... forgot. She... your girl friend? I would never... N-No, she very... cute. ...Holy cats! That schoolgi... S-Sorry. I not... say... anything. These awful things keep happening... S-Sorry. I hope... Navy men... okay. Geez louise, things get worse and worse... S-Sorry. I hope... Navy men... okay. Will the n-next... next... Will next target be...? Will Army's... next... target be... foreigners...? Hope... not. N-No way! We gotta get out of here! But, where would we go that a machine that big couldn't reach us!? N-No way! We gotta get out of here! We've gotta run, as far and as fast as we can! I... I'm tall, with an unusual face. I get mistaken for a foreigner all the time. Japanese girls all carry a torch for foreign guys, so I told a little white lie... So, now what?I'm gonna bite the bullet and apologize. I'll do anything to get her to forgive me. And, if she does... I've decided I'd like to go steady with her. That dame's such a pushover, I better make sure she doesn't fall for any more baloney. Yeah, you're right. I'd better cut and run. I'll get out of here... but I'm not leaving without her.  The handsome guy's thoughts can be heard... What a pushover. Girls in the Capital will fall all over themselves for a foreign guy. I need a new business suit, and this dame is just the ticket. I-I had no idea I was that much older than her! Well, I'll forgive her this once... Next time, it'll take more to get me back. Like maybe an automobile... Whoops, I shouldn't yawn so much. Though, I'm more hungry than bored. I'll make her pick up the check. I've been eating all that pasta; next time I should insist on trying some Japanese food. Yikes, that detective lifted me by my shirt's collar! If this dame hadn't jumped in, I could have been in hot water! Foreigners attract too much attention in Harumi-Cho. Maybe I should try to look less conspicuous... All that dame cares about in a man is if he's foreign or not. I'm just a foreign toy to her... not that I can say anything. That schoolgirl probably just came to Harumi-Cho to check out the foreigners. Most schoolgirls are flat broke, but she is pretty easy on the eyes. What the hell? Can't that schoolgirl read the signs? I'm coming on to you, dope! She's not even looking at me! Hey! Good-looking guy over here! Huh? They're rounding up all the illegal immigrants? Oh, man, this could be a problem. I just have to keep my head down. Is the military involved in the hunt for immigrants? I-It's got nothing to do with me! What am I going to do? Th-The Navy soldiers... They're hunting for illegal immigrants! It'd be no laughing matter if they mistake me for a foreigner! I'm Japanese, dammit! Th-The Navy soldiers... they're hunting for illegal immigrants! It'd be no laughing matter if they mistake me for a foreigner! I'm Japanese! I was born right here! I just saw Harad... Well, she's the owner of Ryugu now. She was walking down to the pier, looking as magnificent as ever. All the unfortunate incidents lately have given this area a bad reputation. I'd better be careful from now on when I walk around at night. What's all that racket at the piers? It got so quiet all of a sudden. All this quiet makes me... *yawn*... sleepy. Kasumidai is wound pretty tight right now. All of Akasaka-Ku is tense. A girl you were with disappeared? Oh, it happened in Kasumidai? That's awful... One more reason not to go anywhere near Akasaka-Ku. Why does the Army need so much money to build such deadly weapons? They should spend all those resources on ways to avoid war, not to fight them. Today's such a beautiful, serene day... Those Navy soldiers should take the day off and relax. It's good to enjoy days like this. If you ask me, those Navy soldiers have too much time on their hands. What could happen on a beautiful day like today? They should just relax and enjoy it. Those Navy soldiers are getting tetchy from Harumi-Cho being so peaceful. But, they lead a tough life. They deserve a break. What's all that racket coming from the naval headquarters? What's all that racket coming from Sakuradayama? Th-That Navy soldier protected me with his life... But... what was that thing? The Special Guard in the red uniform? The Special Guard in the red uniform, and that ball of light I just saw... What's happening in Harumi-Cho? Wh-What will become of us? Even from here, I could feel the heat. I hope the people by the ocean are all right... That monster must have been the work of a terrible warmonger. If they want to start a war, they can do it somewhere else! I can't get in those brave Navy soldiers' way... I can take care of myself! I'm not afraid of any monster! Those foreigners may be outsiders, but their large builds and attitude problems make them a nuisance. I won't do anything in front of the owner of Ryugu, but... I can't stand those guys. Whoever's hitting the cargo is only targeting our ships, never the foreign ones. Suspicious, ain't it? Which country do you suppose is behind it all? Thinking back, I assumed those foreigners were guilty without a shred of proof... It's shameful. A Capital merchant like me should be kind to those folks. Business has been booming since those attacks ended, and I'm getting along swell with the foreigners. The owner of Ryugu is looking after us, too, so everything's hunky-dory in Harumi-Cho. That was amazing!  You'll never guess what I saw! What did you see?A young man, riding on the back of a giant turtle! His cloak was flapping in the ocean wind. I'm serious! He was riding that turtle like his own yacht! Yeah, sure, laugh it up. Nobody takes me seriously... That was amazing!  You'll never guess what I saw! What did you see?That young man on top of the huge turtle was carrying a girl... She was wearing burgundy clothes... just like the dame I saw earlier. Yeah, sure, laugh it up. Nobody takes me seriously... That was amazing!  You'll never guess what I saw! What did you see?The guy on the turtle, carrying the woman in burgundy... He must be some kind of superhuman! And, that lady... he saved her from certain death! Yeah, sure, laugh it up. Nobody takes me seriously... The Navy soldiers look awful bored. Sure, it's quiet around Harumi-Cho these days, but they should stop and smell the flowers! The Army is marching to Sakuradayama from Akasaka-Ku. It's something about a spy... Like the Army needs an excuse to mobilize. Those Special Guards in the red uniforms were after the Navy, so we got off scot-free. But, I'm worried about the ships due any minute. Harumi-Cho is in no shape to welcome visitors. That ball they launched better not come back down anywhere around here. There are ships due any minute now. What are we gonna do with the incoming merchants? The place behind that fence is private property. No trespassers. It's surrounded by water, so you couldn't get in anyway. The place behind that fence is private property. That big eyesore there is the Catholic Church. The wretched thing blocks all the sunlight. Every morning is gloomy because of that. The place behind that fence is private property. The owner passed away, though... I wish his estate would knock down that huge church. It takes ages for my laundry to dry. Everything seems to have calmed down. But, what about my laundry!? That church is still blotting out all the sunlight! I can't hang my laundry indoors, it won't dry all the way! There'll be no peace around here as long as that church is still standing! The bath towel I used yesterday was still wet from the day before! Someone, anyone, get rid of that two-bit church! That hideous thing is preventing my laundry from drying! It's still damp! Demolish that awful church! I need to dry my laundry! I went to pay my respects to a shrine in Sakuradayama. Hopefully, it'll lead to that church being torn down so my house can get some sunlight. They should have torn down that church, not the naval headquarters! Please, save my laundry! Deliver me from dampness! If they were able to shoot a shiny ball into space, couldn't they knock down one lousy church!? Spend that arms budget on something useful for a change! That intense heat finally dried my laundry! But, there's dust and soot all over them... Now I have to wash them all over again!  You! Stop that monster from using any more heat blasts! It dried my towels, but they're filthy now! I prefer my towels to be only half-dried anyway. That monster is more than welcome as far as I'm concerned! I'm still hoping it'll knock down that church. Just as long as it doesn't blow more hot wind on my laundry!  The chubby washerwoman calmed down. Well, it's not going to rain anytime soon, so I can leave it out a little while longer. I can't get too worked up over the laundry, or I'll get more wrinkles. It doesn't really matter where the laundry hangs, as long as it gets dry. Well, using the same towel two days in a row won't kill me. Housewives don't get a day off. I admit, there are better ways to use my time than complaining about the laundry. The dust and debris would probably fly all over the place if that church was knocked down... I'm sure some of it would fall on my laundry, and then where would I be? I can't ask someone else to accomplish such a huge task just on account of the laundry. The best I can hope for is that some kind of natural disaster brings the place down. The government wouldn't waste their budget on a paltry thing like my laundry... It's a shame about that blast of heat... The ash blew onto my towels. I suppose they did dry out, but I'd rather do it with sunlight. I'm sorry, dear. I didn't expect you to go to so much trouble just to solve my laundry problem. Want me to put your cloak in with my next load? You think I could get the monster to destroy only the church and then leave? It might not understand our language. If it destroyed my house along with it, I'd lose everything... No use asking me. No use, I not knowing anything.  The smiling man's thoughts can be heard... Me introduce girl him, he give me reside permit. He get girl, I get papers, we both happy. Japan merchant's reputation falling. More jobs for me, more money for me. Oh! An executive...? Nevah mind, it's just a boy. Get out of here! ...... Ohh! Mistah, wannah massage, five hundred yen...? Oh, you just a boy...  The foreign escort's thoughts can be heard... No permission needed work Harumi-Cho. Fukagawa-Cho so annoying! Mistah Satake ask too many questions! I do much better in Harumi-Cho. Being a detective is steady work. It's like combing through sand by hand; we'll never run out. I wonder how many arrests I've made... How many is a cop supposed to make, anyway? I'm the wrong person to ask about machines, pal.  Say, y'know that junk store near Narumi's joint? Konnou-Ya, it's called. Why don't you try your luck there? There's a rumor going around about the Army makin' warships. I asked the chief about it, but... He gave me the brush-off. The higher a bigwig's rank, the less he gives a damn about the people under 'im.  Detective Kazama's spirit was rekindled. If they don't listen up, I'll have no choice but to throw the book at 'em! Hoods ain't gonna run rampant in the Capital as long as I'm  around! Any tool can be a weapon in the hands of a determined criminal! If you take any indecent pictures, don't think I won't string you up in no time flat! I won't let my bosses kick me around anymore! I serve the public, not the chief! A real man would be hell-bent on turnin' this rotten society around, and that's what I'll do! ...... ...Wha--!? Oh! It's you, Raidou! Hey, you really look different. You look like a man now. ...I used to be the leader of the local gang of punks. But, now I'm sporting this cherry blossom crest, workin' on the side of the law. Even though I'm using cuffs instead of my fists, I still hate crooked people. I decided to become a flatfoot cause I can be myself... with what little brains I got. You've got the same eyes I did when I was young: reckless, yet straightforward. ...Take this, will ya? When you get to be my age, make sure to keep that sparkle in your eyes.  Raidou obtained the . Detective Kazama is looking into that private property in connection with the foreigner's dead body. He seemed like he was in over his head, but... well, go talk to him if you've a mind to. We'll be finished here anytime now, though. On our way over, Detective Kazama busted an illegal immigrant. He shouted, Confess! right after he slapped the cuffs on. I felt sorry for the poor sap, even if he did commit the crime. The monster showed at the same time that the ships arrived... The ship went down... Lotta crewmen died aboard that tub. That foreigner there was screamin' bloody murder for a while, and then stopped moving. Somethin' horrible musta happened to the blighter. But, afterwards he just laughed like nothin' was wrong. Harumi-Cho won't be rebuilt in a day, but we gotta do our best. The souls of the dead need to get a proper sendoff so they can make it into the pearly gates. Please... water... May I have... water... please...! I... saw it... I've always wanted to see... Kachidoki-bashi... But... how can I go home... in this condition...?  The distressed student's thoughts can be heard... Mother... I'm sorry... I broke my promise... not to leave the school grounds... Please don't be... angry... If you laugh, happiness will follow! Right? Let's laugh and be happy!  Hahaha! Hahahahahah! ...Ha... Haha ... Haa... M-My neck itches!  Why so itchy!? Is a ghost? I am maybe possessed by a ghost? All this incense does is make neck itch! I don't care if nice smell! No want this anymore!

I'm gonna run away...  The hairy-chested foreigner's thoughts can be heard... Never seen dead body before... They told me Capital is safe place... I run away... Far, far away... That man there... he's dead. He was mortally wounded... What happened to him?We were drinking our troubles away, because of the martial law... We got so drunk that we... erm... took a leak together. When that huge quake struck, he wasn't standing up too straight, and he fell and hit his head... W-We were supposed to go into business together! W-We were supposed to go into business together! ......  He's breathed his last...   became attuned to the inner voice.  It's a Dragon Cave.

You're not a half-bad Devil Summoner. This here's our Subterranean Shipbuilding Facility. This is where Major General Munakata in his master plan! You'll never shut us down, and we'll show you why! Ulp... He's incredibly strong, Sir! I... I suggest we retreat! What!? What did you just say? Dumbass! The enemy is in front of you, not behind you! You advance FORWARD! ...... You got lucky, punk! Our first priority is to report to Major General Munakata, so we've got no time for scum like you! Besides, even without us, you'll never reach the bottom of this place. Hahahah! Execute strategic withdrawal! I-It doesn't count as retreating!  The Zombie Guards left... Dumb sap can call it whatever floats his boat... Anyway, now we know for sure. Not only is this 's stronghold, this is where  is being held. Not much of a security detail from what I can tell... We probably don't have much time left. Let's go, . Look! There's Kaya! We finally made it. It's all or nothing, Raidou. We've got to get her back, no matter what it takes! I'm sick of all these walls... Can't those guys think of anything more creative to throw at us?  The wall emitted a bright light as it regenerated. Like a regular wall wasn't bad enough... This one looks like it's been enchanted to regenerate every time it's destroyed. Whoever put up this blasted thing must be around here somewhere. We'll just have to find him and ask him... politely... to take it down. You're wasting your time, .

That's our Munakata... extra-careful and impossibly frustrating. Your demon can pass first with no harm done. But, Munakata is on the other side... In the end, you've got to face him yourself, . We've got to remove this wall somehow... Got any ideas, ? Smash it apartC'mon, Raidou, I thought you were smarter than that. You know you can't use brute force on it. Hey, don't underestimate this thing. It'll sap your strength as you pass through 'till you're dead. Now there's an idea. Just like when we got rid of the regenerating wall... I shoulda seen it myself. Great work, . Let's go follow up on that. Hey, this isn't the time for jokes, . Plus, it wasn't even a good one. You could learn a lot from my own sharp sense of humor, y'know. , remember the last time we were here? The regenerating wall had us stumped, so we asked Ippon-datara to remove it. Maybe the same trick will work again. Let's ask the Ippon-datara we passed to remove the wall. One of them has to be able to .  would make a good landing zone if we wanted to jump off. From there, we could jump off to the left or right. Pretty slick, if I say so myself. I rETiREd. i'M gOInG baCK To bEInG rEGuLaR iPpOn-DAtARa. Nix to that.

ZZzzz...  The sleeping demon is blocking the way... Hit it to wake it up...! How was I dismembered so thoroughly...? My body must still be numb from the long sleep. I've been asleep for over one thousand years. That I wake up at this very moment must be fate. I am Arahabaki! You must be Karasu's man. One of the Devil Summoner line... Your kind has vanquished the enemies of Amatsu since ages past. Which means... you're here to defend the Capital once again. You'll have to pass by me first! Hmm, railroad tracks underground... Must have been a secret shipping route. Pretty impressive. Well, at least we discovered something new. Plus, we're finally on Munakata's trail. He's been a tough nut to crack. Stay sharp, . Don't you ever give up? I won't let you meddle with the project anymore! You'll die right here, right now! I have been waiting for you, Devil Summoner Raidou Kuzunoha. May I say, this is definitely a pleasure! I am Munakata, the man behind the Super Soldier Project. I've learned quite a bit about you from Rasputin's report on a troublesome young man... I have a strict policy of erasing all who interfere, but in this case that is quite regretful. So, I'm going to explain our project to you, directly. That way, you can decide for yourself if you truly wish to stand against us. You need not throw your life away; hear me out and give it some thought. Think of our nation, Raidou. Look at what it has become. ...The masses struggle to live in poverty while a select few stand in abundance. Our country blindly creates policies to suppress the weak and cater to the wealthy. Do you not find this strange? An enlightened nation would strive to support the less fortunate, yet we do the opposite! Even at the start, the gods of Amatsu subjugated the people of our country. At this rate, this nation... our people... will be stricken from the face of the earth. I wish only to enlighten those who perpetuate the erroneous ideologies of our past. And, the only method available to me is the Super Soldier Project. ...This girl is necessary for the completion of the project. Knowing this, would you still take her from us, Raidou Kuzunoha? Or, do you have the will to join me in righting our nation's wrongs? Join him...Worse than lacking in will, you choose to spit lies. The girl is lost to you, Raidou. I have pressing business to return to. ...So be it. Using the directional buttons, press up/down to change numbers and left/right to change position.  A telephone booth stands watch silently. I assume this is the entrance to that secret joint Sadakichi was talking about. Try out that passcode, . Level with me... Why would anyone need a phone out here? A mystery for the ages, I guess. . We have pressing matters in the case, remember?  Raidou has no business here.  The phonebooth was activated. . I'm looking forward to putting this case behind me.  Nothing happened. ? Don't tell me the passcode slipped your mind. Either way, let's get out of here before the bad guys spot us. --Who's there!? ...Raidou! You're okay!  Raidou explained everything that happened. ...I see. You had a rough time of it, then. But, why are you here? You saw my note; I told you to wait back at the office! This is no place for kids. ...You should go home. Don't worry, I'll stop the Super Soldier Project and Munakata... ...Don't think I can do it? ...... ...Raidou, I used to be in the military, back in my younger days. I first heard about the Major General way back then. Super laser... Super tank... He designed the Super Military Project as a way to strengthen Japan. But, nobody really took him that seriously. Munakata was treated as a fool-- a dreamer--and he disappeared. ...But, he never suggested we start harming civilians. ...That same man is back with a new Super Military Project, and this time he's dragging innocents into it. I don't know what changed him, but... I can't just ignore it. Killing civilians in the name of your country? It's insane. I'll do what I have to... Even if it means going down along with him. ...So just leave this to me, Raidou. Take care of things at the office, okay? Answering for the past is an adults-only job. It's you kids who have to worry about the future.  Yes.How can you agree with that baloney, !? Those demons are going to rip him to shreds--you know that. You have to help Narumi. ...What, you're just going to play with your cat? Do you understand or don't you? ...Yeah, I figured you'd say that. I guess your lineage does kind of make this your problem, doesn't it, Raidou Kuzunoha the 14th...? ...Yeah, I get it, I get it. Let's go stop Munakata together. Answer me, Munakata... I know who you were before. You've always loved our nation, but you never would have hurt innocent people! Why now!? What are you trying to accomplish? ...This is vengeance as old as time. The slaves of the Amatsu all must die. Wh-What!? I said, the people living in the Capital are of no importance to me. That is our desire... ...fueled by the voices of our fallen comrades, drenched in blood and disgrace... ...That is why we must annihilate all you foolish humans! The only foolish human here is you, Munakata. You're out of your gourd. *chuckle* Foolish, am I? The purpose of this Soulless God is to annihilate the millions of people huddled in the Capital. They will all die, reflecting in agony upon their sins! Who cares? Something that happened thousands of years ago has nothing to do with us now! You are their descendants. Simply being born is a sin! Baloney. You know nothing of we who were oppressed! A shame you will die before the Capital falls! So, Munakata was possessed by some demon, was he? ...How could this happen? He always thought about what was best for the country. And, the demon used that desire against him... It's depressing. Raidou, remember how I told you I was in the military? I was part of the Imperial Army, same as Munakata. But, before long, I learned too much. I saw ideologies and activities in our nation which went beyond human understanding. There, it seemed like one person was so insignificant... ...Everything started to feel pointless. My life there, the military itself... But, I was wrong. Everyone needs to do what they can-- really push their personal limits. That's how I felt watching you, Raidou. ...... ...Think that's the monster out there!? Let's check it out! ...You can be pushy, you know that? Now, let's get to stopping Munakata. The Capital's counting on us, even if they don't know it. I don't care if it's a grudge, blind zealotry, or just a desire to maintain order... There's no reason we should let the military push us around! ...We're not doing this because Yatagarasu told us to--this is for every person in the Capital! ......  Munakata is dead. Munakata and Sukuna-hikona held true to their natures until the very end. But, using force without minding the consequences is like a child throwing a temper-tantrum. Too bad they didn't realize monsters gotta be kept on a tight leash. Let's scram. ! That Soulless thing should be near the ocean! Let's take the eastern staircase and head toward Harumi-Cho.  It's a Dragon Cave. Mysterious power is flowing out of it...  Here, Raidou can record his findings without being disturbed.  Save? Yes Recover health? Yes  and his demons were healed. *sob* *sob* ...Who are you? I've never seen you around here... I'm Nakisawame. I heal everyone... *sob* Welcome. *sob* Welcome. It's a full moon, so... Do you want me to heal you? Yes yen... Is that okay? YesThis may sting a little, but only for a moment...   and his demons were healed.   was healed. *sob* Don't die on me... Please... *sob* So... You're going to die, too... You don't have enough money... *sob* So... You'll die just like all the rest...  Leave the area? Yes It's an elevator.  It looks like humans are unable to reach inside and take the contents.  It's a glowing, red crystal.  The contents inside shift and warp.

Well, , let's go help the poor little sailors. Please, help out my comrades. Looks like my comrades are okay. I owe you guys a lot. Where are we, by the way? Can we get home from here? The one responsible for dragging these sailors and shipments into the Dark Realm should be nearby. All we have to do is defeat him, and these sailors should be able to get back to the Real World. Ahhh! Help me! Thanks! That was a close one. My comrades were attacked, too. You've got to help them, kid! What's going on? A-Am I safe? Please, save my comrades. My comrades are all safe, but what's going on here? Looks like my comrades are all okay. Thanks, kid, you're a lifesaver! Ahhh! Help me! You saved my life! I can't thank you enough. My comrades were attacked, too... Please, help them! Please help my comrades! Looks like my comrades are all safe, but I wanna go home. My comrades are okay? Thanks!

Now we can finally deliver our cargo safely. Hmm...?  Light streamed over the sailors. Wow...!  There is an exit leading to the Real World.  It looks like a one-way path.  Exit the Dark Realm?  The demon felt strange.  It decided to report back to Raidou. (The Dark Realm ends here and return to the Real World) (A flag to activate the Tarrasque event) (Flag: 77) (The Ring of Memories is given by the owner of Ryugu)  Return to the shrine? Looks like the sailors are back home safe. We should get home ourselves.

Maybe no one will notice. I'll just slip out to do some laundry, and no one will be the wiser. Once the evidence has been erased, no one needs to know about my weak bladder problem. Where the hell are we? I'd be dead if it wasn't for this kid.

Go ahead and try some! Oh, Mr. Kuzunoha, I didn't know you were a cat fancier. Aren't cats great? When I'm stroking one, all my cares just melt away. Everyone around here names their cats things like Rusty or Princess. I'd never give a cat such a  pedestrian name. Just the other day, I picked up a stray cat. He was mewling in front of the store. The poor thing was starving... He's so precious. I'm trying to think of a name for him now. I picked up another stray to go along with the first one. This one's spotted. He's every bit as cute! Do you think there's a network of information among cats, just like the one between humans here? I ask because lately, more and more stray cats have been gathering behind the shop. They're cute, but... It's becoming expensive to care for them all. Mr. Kuzunoha, can I have a word with you? I love each and every one of those cats, but there are simply too many for me to handle now. So, I was thinking of giving a few of them away to people who want one. How about you? Do you need another cat? Oh, Mr. Kuzunoha! I found a person willing to take in a stray cat. But... just as I was handing her over, I looked at the lady, and my mind went fuzzy. Before I knew what I was doing, I had told her I'd changed my mind. I felt strange, as if my body had been taken over or something. Mr. Kuzunoha... I've been feeling so strange lately. You may laugh, but... I've started to see cats as humans. Especially the one that just showed up. She's so beautiful, with such luscious curves... Wh... What am I saying...? Maybe I'm overworking myself. So, you're the new Kuzunoha, eh? If you want to hunt demons, you don't need muscle... you need brains. If there's anything you want to know, just ask. Basic combatThe lesson: the basic principle of combat is to exploit your enemy's . If you're facing an enemy you've never seen before, you won't know their weakness, of course. In that case, try using different kinds of bullets and different demons to attack them. Fire, Ice, Force, Electricity, Physical, Death... Demons all have some sort of weakness. You can tell when you've found it, because they'll be immobile, leaving them wide open. That's your chance to attack and deal  damage. Landing an attack like that can really give you a rush of power. So endeth the lesson. I see you're a fighter who works with both a gun and a sword. The lesson: how to fight effectively using them in tandem. First, the gun. It's useful against demons, even if there's some distance between you and the target. It's not as powerful as the sword, but even a normal bullet can momentarily stun your opponent. Not as long as hitting them in their weak spot, but enough to give you a slight advantage. That brief opening is a prime opportunity to send in your demons, and use your sword. Once they're immobile, run up to them and slash away. If you can do that, you've got it made. Remember, though, these are demons we're talking about. Don't go around shooting people, got it? So endeth the lesson. The lesson: coordination between yourself and your demons. It's what makes you a real Devil Summoner. Don't think that summoning demons at random will do you any good. The first rule of summoning is to summon the ones who can exploit the enemy's weaknesses. If you or your demons attack while the enemy's weakness leaves them immobile... The demon's morale will increase, giving you a chance to perform a . There's no rule that says you can only use one demon per battle, so go ahead and switch 'em at will. Once you master manipulating demons and using all the different Combination Skills... You shouldn't have any trouble with the trials ahead of you. So endeth the lesson. Hang on. I've got one more piece of advice before you go. Yatagarasu gave you that Mystic Eye, right? Never mind how I know that. The point is... You can use it to see the abilities of any enemy whose weakness you've exploited before. With that thing, you can see their specialties as well as their weaknesses. Know your enemy like you know yourself. The more you learn, the less you'll be caught off guard.  The Mystic Eye can be used by pressing the R1 button in battle and selecting Analyze. Oh, it's you, Kuzunoha. You look like you're moving up in the world. You'll always be a greenhorn to me, but I'm glad to help out the less fortunate. How about it? Want another lesson from the top demon hunter around these parts? A summoner's stats stats are more important than you'd think where demons are concerned. If a summoner has high Magic, the demons he summons will also be more powerful. Even a weak summoner can summon hefty demons as long as he's got high Magic. Higher magic also makes it cheaper as far as MAG goes to summon a demon. You can't win battles on strength alone. Remember that. That's Magic. Now, about Luck. This has to do with your demons' investigation skills. For the skills that pick things up, like items or money, the summoner's Luck plays a big part. It also comes into play if you have to retreat from an opponent who's got the upper hand... ...as well as whether or not you'll be affected by poison and stone attacks. It's easy to overlook, but in the long run, Luck can really save your bacon. So endeth the lesson. The lesson: there are things a Devil Summoner should carry at all times. The most important of these is the Anti-Mind. It can cure various status ailments that your demons contract, so always have a spare few of these. If you don't, you could end up in a situation where your demons can't do squat to the enemy. Don't just think of yourself all the time in battle. Your demons need attention, too. So endeth the lesson. Oh, so you're the boy who claimed the title of Raidou the 14th? Do you need any help to get started, dear? No one knows their stuff the way I do when it comes to demons. I just can't help researching the little guys; they're just too cute! So, what do you want to know? How to catch demonsYou already know about exploiting enemy weaknesses and all that, right? Well, when a demon gets hit in its weak spot, it becomes immobile for a second or two. All you've got to do is get close when they're stunned and perform the art of confinement. The rest is up to you. If you're strong enough to handle the demon, it'll get sucked into your tube and fight alongside you. If you're not, well, just train some more and try again. Cheer up, Raidou dear, it's not all bad news. Listen to this... If you're having trouble making a demon your ally, don't just rush in and try to confine it. Haste makes waste, I always say! What you should do first is drain the demon's life, bit by bit. Once it's weak, you'll have a much better chance of confining it. That's the real trick. Demons say such cute things when they get sucked into a tube! Keep an eye on the moon, though. Depending on its phase, it might be impossible to confine them. Of course, different rules apply when you're trying to catch a  demon. Good luck out there! Be careful!  The art of confinement is a technique to make demons your allies.  You can confine demons as long as they have a lower level than yours.  There are two exceptions:  The first is the phase of the moon. On full moons, demons turn wild and cannot be confined.  The second is the Skill order. These demons cannot be confined under normal circumstances.  Unlike other demons, they can only be confined during certain periods of time.  Pay attention to a demon's order when attempting to confine it. You mean once you've confined them? Sure, I'll tell you all about it. Each demon has different skills depending on its order. The most basic skill is the ability to go . You can send the demon out on its own to search places too dangerous for humans. A flying demon might fly over rivers or up to high places, and a small demon could fit in tight spaces. Other demons can find money or items as they walk around. Still others use their abilities only when you order them to. All the demons will use everything they've got to do their best. It's so adorable! You've got some demons with you, so why don't you give it a try? A demon's investigation skills depend on its order.  For example, the Pyro order has Ignite, while the Pagan order has Read Mind.  If a  appears in the Action Window, you can use an investigation skill.  If you find something like that, summon different orders of demons to see if anything presents itself.  Demons also have an investigation skill unrelated to their order.  These skills vary according to the characteristics of that particular demon.  Some of these are not used through the Action Window.  Press the R1 button to bring up the Investigation Menu. There will be a command not usually seen there.  Selecting this will direct the demon to use its skill.  Other investigation skills take effect just by walking around.  By summoning many different types of demons, you can try out all the investigation skills. Well, best of luck, Raidou dear. Oh, wait, I almost forgot. Demons want MAG whenever you summon them. If you run out of MAG, you won't be able to use demons, so be careful! If you're out of MAG, you can fight a few battles, or trade in demons at this very shop. Personally, I think it's cute how the demons always ask for more MAG. They're hungry little guys! How are things going, Raidou dear? Are you taking good care of your cute little demons? If you have any questions about demon care, I'll be happy to help! What do you need to know? Using demons in battleDemons are skilled at more than investigation. They can use skills during battle, too. They run around doing using everything they can to help their summoner. Isn't that adorable? The skills each demon has depends on its order. That lets you split up their roles depending on the situation. You'll sometimes find red crystals in the Dark Realm. They're like treasure chests, except that humans can't open them. Demons, on the other hand, can crack them open and take the contents. What's inside depends on the demon's personality, so mind which demon you use. Ooh, just in time, m'boy! I've just remembered something good. A young summoner like you might find it useful. Want to hear it? YesTake a seat, m'boy, and I'll tell you all about it. It's something to watch out for when summoning demons. Listen carefully, now. You use different demons all the time for battle and investigation, don'tcha? An efficient summoner would preset the demons he wants in each situation. One fer walking around town, and one fer fighting enemies. You see, m'boy? Why don't you go ahead and give it a whirl? Careful, though, since re-summoning demons will eat up your MAG right quick.  You can set a demon to be summoned automatically at the start of battle from the Default menu.  Press the  button to open the Main Menu, then select Demon, then Default.  There, you can select which demon is automatically summoned during battle.  The selected demon will appear by Raidou's side at the start of each battle.  It is wise to keep the demons you use the most, for battle and investigation, close at hand. Ooh, just in time, m'boy! I've just remembered something good. A couple of things come to mind. Which one would you like to know? About the Shikimi no KageThe Shikimi no Kage... Well, each one has a different weakness, so pay attention to that. If you don't hit its weakness, then it's like, well, pounding on a brick wall. Completely useless. Make sure you keep different types of demons and bullets around to handle the various walls. No one knows much about the Red Capes. Who are they? What are they here for? It's a mystery. They've got to be up to something, though, since Red Capes have been popping up all over the Capital. Take care, m'boy, that you don't end up as a Red Cape yourself. Ooh, just in time, m'boy! I've just remembered something good. There's a small forest called Kasuminomori just to the north of Kasumidai. I hear there's a secret passage leading underground there that only a select few know about. You can't get there by train, though. You've gotta go by sea, so keep that in mind. Ooh, just in time, m'boy! I've just remembered something good. Keep tabs on your demon's order when you get it out solo and it gets into a scrap. If your demon picks a fight with a demon it can't defeat, it's all over. It could get nasty if your demon's weakness is something like  or . Oh! You are a Japanese summoner, mais oui? I am a summoner also. I 'ave come to Japan to learn 'ow your summoners do things. Allow me to tell you what I 'ave learned. Shall I tell you one of ze rumors I 'eard? The Konnou-Ya rumorKonnou-Ya, yes? Ze owner is most pig-headed, if I may say so. Only for 'is most excellent customers does he  and . Ze Japanese are so cheap! I 'ave already noted it down in my book. Oh, zis soda parlour here? Shin-Sekai is a place most magnifique. If you come here often, zey will offer you more sodasyou can get more MAG for ze demons. But, you are only coming 'ere so recently, and zat will not apply to you yet. Ze men and women of underground Japan come 'ere and get giggly on ze soda. 'owever, ze effects only last until ze new moon, so do not forget. Ah, Monsieur Summoner! It 'as been a while, 'as it not? I 'ave been doing more research. Would you like to 'ear it? Shop rumorsAh, ze wonders of Asia! Ze incense mystical is a treasure tres desirable. It was used for ze aromatherapy, to relaxe ze body and mind of 'umans and demons alike. Zere are four varieties, and it is rumored zat a few are hidden somewhere in ze Capital. I 'ear zey're at , and . I 'ear also of one in  zat only summoners can reach. But, to just go zere is not enough. You must also  ze area. Do you 'ave a book? You should be writing zis down, like I do. Ah, ze famous conqueror Genghis Khan. I 'eard someone saw a man who looked just like 'im. Zis was at a place only kitsune... 'ow you say, ze fox, knows. Is zat right? Kitsune? Yoki-tsune? Yoshitsune...? Something like zat. Write zat down before you forget. 'allo! It is good to see you again, Monsieur Summoner! You have ze curse, yes? It is very 'azardous. I will pray zat your curse is lifted. It 'as been some time, Monsieur Summoner! I have nearly completed ze research. What would you like to 'ear? Shop rumorsZis is what I 'ear as I walk around the Capital. Telephone girl rumorZis mysterious telephone girl... Do you not know of 'er? Alors, ze poor girl . It is a sad story to break one's 'eart. Quelle dommage... Anyway, as zey built ze Capital, ze phone booths became commonplace. Some say zey occasionally 'ear ze phone begin to ring suddenly, with no one on ze other end. At least, ze humans cannot 'ear who is calling. Only ze demons who knew ze girl very well can 'ear who is speaking. Zis is important, what I am telling you! You should be writing it down. I wonder, 'ow would you know which demon knew zis girl? A 'ard rumor to test, non? Ze Training Hall? Mais oui, I thought every summoner knew about zis. Zere is no better place to 'one your skills. Not only zat, but zey 'old many secrets for ze enterprising summoner. Zere are four branches to ze Training Hall. But, you will have to cross ze sea to reach them. Are you writing zis down? Zere are four branches to ze Training Hall. Each one 'as ze peculiarities. I'll tell you about zem. Devil Summoners challenge ze Training Halls to obtain, how you say, ze treasure. 'owever, ze summoners zemselves do not face zese challenges. Only zere demons can do it. Why do you not have ze book to write zis down? It is important! Ahh, yes, one other thing. Zis is 'ard to believe, but you should know. Zere 'ave been sightings of a cow with ze 'uman face lately, around ze Capital. It is not easy to find, and zey say it runs away as soon as people see it. If you should see such a thing, you will let me know, oui? Bon soir, Monsieur Summoner. Ah! It is ze privilege to see you again, Monsieur Summoner! ...What is ze matter? Where is ze kitty you always 'ave with you? Un chat adorable, it was. Is ze kitty on 'oliday? You will bring it back with you next time, oui? So, you're the punk who claimed the name of Raidou, huh? Well, to me you look like a scrawny kid who doesn't know fusion from fewmets. If you want to become a summoner in the big leagues, you better listen to my advice. You been going to the Gouma-Den regularly? Victor's always got a new experiment brewing. Sometimes he comes up with a totally new process. No harm checking in there once in a while. Did you know your sword's power changes depending on which demon you fuse it with? 's true. Some of them will boost not just the sword, but give a little power to the wielder as well. No harm in trying out different fusions, so don't be afraid. Your elemental affinity changes with the sword, too. Sometimes you might want different types of swords depending on what you'll be facing out there. You think you know everything, do you? Well, listen up, boy, cause there's still Pagan and Skill demons. If you fuse them, forget everything you knew about skill inheritance. They're a whole different story. If you can use them well, though, you can make some really heavy hitters. Skill inheritance isn't random, boy. There's a pattern to it you have to learn how to see. It's got to do with the phase of the moon during fusion, and the looks of the demon to be fused. If you don't like the skill it'll inherit, you can try waiting for the moon to wax or wane. You been using the Devil Chart? The smart play is to register demons when their Loyalty is high. That'll make your job a lot easier when it comes time for fusion. Of course, it might get a little hard on your wallet, but you seem like a rich kid. Even you must have noticed by now that there's a limit to how much a given demon's abilities can grow. You could just always fuse demons who've hit their peak, but... If you use incense, you can raise a demon's limit by increasing its basic stats. Your favorite demon with ultimate powers... it's every summoner's dream, kid. I've heard you've trounced a lot of powerful demons. Not bad, kid. Question is, did you know you could control the big boys? By using fusion at the Gouma-Den, you can make an ally out of any past enemy. You've seen their power with your own eyes... Don't tell me you wouldn't want them on your side. Demon fusion isn't an exact science, whatever Victor tells you. Accidents do happen. Sometimes it works in your favor, like if you get a demon you weren't expecting through Binary. But, sometimes you'll lose your demon for nothing in Sacrifice, and them's the breaks. It does seem like there are some conditions that'll cause accidents more often, though... Watch out for 'em. You never know what'll happen in a fusion accident, but it's not always a bad thing. Sometimes, a demon with a higher level than yours will be born... In a Sacrifice accident, the demon might get a bigger boost than you were expecting. If you're sure you won't regret it, you could always try to make an accident happen on purpose. I've got a new theory on the way demons inherit skills in Binary. You were paying attention before when I told you about a law governing skill inheritance, right? Well, it seems the law changes during a full moon, new moon, young moon, and waning moon. During the new moon, I've heard you can do fusions where the demon doesn't inherit any skills. It seems like a dumb idea at first, but if you're smart about it, it can come in handy. If you want to know how, figure it out, kid. I can't be around to hold your hand forever. You still playing the rookie, kid? That act isn't fooling anyone anymore. I don't have anything left to tell you about fusion. A veteran summoner like you is too sharp to need my advice. Good luck out there, pal. If you manage to catch the Red Cape at Kurisu-zaka during the full moon... You better give your old pal Kichou Asakura the exclusive! I'm counting on you, Raidou! Oh, Raidou. Did you see the Red Cape? Yes, I did.R-Really!? Show me where! I-I need to get a photo... ...What? He ran away? What kind of detective lets a crook like the Red Cape get off scot-free!? Maybe it's me, but I think that Narumi sap is starting to rub off on you, Raidou... That's strange... I heard it from a reliable source... Sorry Raidou, but I guess you'll have to carry on with the investigation. Here, have a little extra for expenses. I won't tell Narumi... Good luck. Raidou... You didn't see anything... peculiar at Daidouji Factory the other day, did you? Sure did....You did? You did! Was it... It didn't happen to be... Floating dolls, maybe...? N-Never mind. Forget I spoke. I won't press you about it... But, gosh Raidou, you are a strange one. I-I see. Well, that's okay... Forget I said anything. Must've been a dream... I don't know what else to call it. A little bird told me you're investigating Harumi-Cho now, Raidou. Speaking of which, it seems any merchant bearing Japanese colors is being attacked. Some say monsters are doing it... But I think the real story is something different. That foreign trader who came to power right when the attacks started happening? Elfman? I think if anything needs investigating around here, it's him. Some construction workers at a Ginza-Cho site found a jizo statue. Sounds to me like it's worth checking out. Why dont you hop to it, Raidou? Something wrong, Raidou? You look a little green around the gills. Narumi's got you running ragged, hasn't he? Yes, he has.I knew it! That lazy piker always makes you do all the work! Some nerve, calling it the Narumi Detective Agency! You should go on strike, Raidou. Hold out for better wages or at least some vacation time. If you say so... Seems to me you'd be more productive if you rested once in a while, but what do I know? C'mon, come sit next to me and have a soda. Narumi doesn't have to know if you take a minute off. You're just in time, Raidou. I just got a juicy tip. Want to hear it? Sure.I was digging up dirt on the Red Cape, and guess what I found? Sightings have been concentrated at five locations across the Capital... And all five correspond with those radio towers the Army is building! Too perfect to be a coincidence, isn't it?  Well, I thought so. Look into it for me, Raidou. Well, your loss. Come back if you change your mind. Narumi came around here not long ago... For once, that bum looked serious. Keep your investigation on the down low, he said. Ha! As if Kichou Asakura would be scared off by the warnings of someone like Narumi! ...That's what I've got to say to him. So please, Raidou, bring him back safely. Whew! You're a lifesaver, Raidou. I was just sitting here organizing my notes on Harumi-Cho, and I lost the whole morning to that pill! Sheesh... Sometimes, beauty like mine is is more trouble than it's worth. Do what you have to do with confidence. I'll be rooting for you, Raidou. This is the Gouma-Den, my personal laboratory. Welcome! The Gouma-Den is open to all who control demons. Come again! Ever since I set up shop here, I have performed experiment after experiment. The result is a brand-new process; a fusion method unlike any other! Gaze upon it in awe! I call it... . It is a process for transferring the powers of one demon to another. If you want to know how it works, I would be delighted to give you a lecture on the subject. Ever since I set up shop here, I have performed experiment after experiment. The result is a brand-new process; a fusion method unlike any other! Steady yourself, for its grandeur may shock you. It is a process to give swords demonic powers, known as... . Remember it well! You can infuse your demon's powers to your katana. If you want to know how it works, I would be delighted to give you a lecture on the subject. ...There seems to be one small peculiarity, though. Perhaps I've tinkered with the machine too much, but it's become a little unstable. Keep that in mind from now on. Demon fusion is a forbidden science, using medieval alchemy together with modern technology. If you want to witness the power of my work for yourself, bring your demons here anytime. I have heard rumors of this Red Cape, but it is a real monster, you say? To warp and mutate the human body without the help of alchemy... Very interesting. If you can capture it and bring it here, it would greatly aid in my research. The Kuzunoha use tubes to confine demons, do they? It seems to be little more than steel cast into a tube... I assume there is some enchantment on it? If you don't mind... could I borrow one for my studies? Have you ever been on a ship before? There's nothing like an ocean voyage. The vast expanse of waves will do your heart good. I suggest you try it sometime. Take it from me, though... Avoid the Arctic Ocean. The Dark Realm is a juncture between the Real World and the Netherworld. You summoners have the ability to go to and from there as you please... As a researcher of the black sciences, I admit to being jealous! Thanks to your help, I've gathered reams of data for my research. I'd like to use it for new experiments, but this basement is much too small for that. If only I had a giant building, something that wouldn't arouse people's suspicions... The Mushoku Fudou at the inlet was once worshipped in order to protect the Capital. There was supposedly a crystal with spiritual power fitted into its body. They called it the Irie Fudou. Does that help? What's this? A technique where you undertake another person's curse? Japanese magic sounds like an intriguing subject for further study... very interesting. I'd like to see something like that with my own eyes. Why don't you run along and agree to it? Ahh, Kuzunoha. I see you have been cursed. I never thought I'd be able to examine a live specimen... It's more than I had hoped! This could prove very useful in my research. Come back here often, won't you? I have heard there is a man using the power of radio waves to affect the human body. Clearly, electricity plays a large part in my work here. Though radio waves and electricity have the same roots and seem similar, they are quite different. I'd like to meet this person. Think of the advances in our science...! Your aura seems different today... Are you really Kuzunoha? Well, no matter. Kuzunoha or no Kuzunoha, any summoner wanting to fuse demons is welcome in my Gouma-Den. Are you saying Rasputin interfered with your investigation? You don't mean the Mad Monk of the Romanov dynasty, do you? I wonder... Has he escaped death and fled here to the Capital as I have...? What is all that noise outside? Is something wrong? Wh-What!? A giant mechanical monster is rampaging through the streets? If only I could see it with my own eyes... Ah, the perils of tinkering with one's own body. If I only had an artificial man with calculating powers beyond that of human minds... Perhaps then, I might be able to solve this equation. Alas, my research has yet to make it to such an advanced stage. If you're looking for the mechanical man, I reassembled him and let him go, as promised. I did... borrow a few unusual parts for my studies, but he should have no difficulties in functioning. With these, my research has advanced one step further towards completion! When one has lived as long as I have, regrets are inevitable. Everyone makes mistakes. On the other hand, perhaps life is good precisely because you only live once. Don't you think?      RED CAPE APPEARS IN THE CAPITAL The Red Cape was recently spotted at Tsukudo-Cho in Yarai-Ku. The Red Cape is reported to attack people from behind, leaving nothing but a blood-soaked corpse. Thought to be a hoax, our intrepid reporters have confirmed that the vile beast does, in fact, exist.  The article continues... MORE RED CAPE MADNESS Sightings of the Red Cape have been reported all over the Capital. It is this writer's theory that unrelated incidents are being blamed on the Red Cape. The police are still tight-lipped about the matter, and the truth is still shrouded in mystery.  The article continues... RED CAPE APPEARS IN THE CAPITAL The Red Cape was recently spotted at Tsukudo-Cho in Yarai-Ku. The Red Cape is reported to attack people from behind, leaving nothing but a blood-soaked corpse. Thought to be a hoax, our intrepid reporters have confirmed that the vile beast does, in fact, exist.  The article continues... MORE RED CAPE MADNESS Sightings of the Red Cape have been reported all over the Capital. It is this writer's theory that unrelated incidents are being blamed on the Red Cape. The police are still tight-lipped about the matter, and the truth is still shrouded in mystery.  The article continues... TRAGEDY IN HIGH SOCIETY One of the Capital's richest families has been plagued with misfortune. The head of the household has fallen ill, his brother has disappeared, and the daughter has been kidnapped. The police have launched a missing persons search, but they've reported no progress so far.  The article continues... FOREIGN MERCHANT SCANDAL The well-known foreign merchant, Mr. Elfman, has been discovered dead. However, his company is still importing goods from overseas, apparently on Elfman's orders. This reporter suspects an impostor, but who did it and for what purpose is still unknown.  The article continues... SUSPICIOUS ARMY PROJECT EXPOSED The Capital Daily has unearthed a shocking truth about the Army. For some time now, the rogue military branch has been carrying out a horrifying plan. If true, we call on them as citizens of this country to reveal to the people the nature of this project.  The article continues... CURSE STRIKES THE CAPITAL Can the modern citizen believe such a headline?

Here y'go, Raidou.  Raidou obtained . It's for expenses. The detective biz runs on money, just like everything else. Go stop by  down the street before you start beating the bushes for that girl. You never know what you might find in that joint. ...What kind of dame would ask someone to kill her? We can't let this go, Raidou. I've got a hunch that this case is bigger than we know. An Ouran High student, huh? She must have been friends with some of the schoolgirls there. Why don't you find girls wearing Ouran uniforms, see what they know? Another schoolgirl was kidnapped right under your nose!? Cripes, Raidou, that's the kind of thing that gives a detective agency a bad name! I don't care if you have to go in the Dark Realm after her, just bring her back safe. The schoolgirl's safe? Good work, Raidou. If she's settled down, you ought to go talk to her again. A curse? In this day and age?  Even if it is an old family tradition, that sounds a little fishy. In the depths of the abyss, the demon's blood must be slain, huh? If you ask me, Rin's hit it on the nose. I think something's going on in that basement. All right, Raidou, your next assignment is to check out the Daidouji Residence. Looks like you'll have to ask her uncle and that guest of his directly. Go back to the Daidouji's place, see if you can find anything else. Raidou, I've got a... special assignment for you at Ryugu. It's not somewhere I can easily go... If the rickshaw runner knows Kiyoshi, maybe he also knows where he's gone. The runner lives in Fukagawa-Cho, huh... Aaah, you'll be fine. But, uh... good luck out there, Raidou. The Kantou Haguro-gumi is an old yakuza group. They're big on trust and chivalry. They can get rowdy, but they're some good eggs. There's no harm in chatting with them. The Special Guards in red that snatched the Daidouji girl are in Fukagawa-Cho now? What's their game, anyway? Well, if they've carried someone off, it's a safe bet we want him. Go rescue him and see what he knows. Hm? If you need a lock pick, I'm sure Konnou-Ya carries 'em. Tracking down elopers isn't my forte... Satake's better at that sort of thing. Why don't you try Daikoku-Yu? So you can only meet the Red Cape if you go to Kurisu-zaka during a full moon? I thought that was werewolves... Well, it's worth a try, I suppose. I'll let you take this one, Raidou. Funny thing for a demon to leave behind, but I guess nothing about this case is normal. Hmmm... Raidou, take this to Shizu's place, will ya? I hope this hunch I've got is wrong, but... You need to brace Denpachi. Go look around for him. Raidou, hurry to Ginza-Cho and put the kibosh on that Red Cape! Things are bad enough... We can't let him compound his mistakes. It's the Daidouji Factory, northeast of Fukagawa-Cho. Don't make a wrong turn at the Red-Light District. Kiyoshi's locked away tight behind a maze, huh? Sounds like bait for a trap to me. But, we can't just give up every time there's an obstacle in the way. Go get 'em, Raidou. What is this, the third Red Cape? They just keep on coming, huh? We've got to find out why people become Red Capes. If only we could discover the common factor... Our best play is to hear Kiyoshi's story. Keep at it, Raidou. Go see what you can find out at Harumi-Cho. Take your time, there's no rush on this one. Human traffic, huh? Ask the Haguro- gumi. Satake might know something about illegal immigration. So, Elfman's the mastermind controlling Harumi-Cho, is he?  Co. until six months ago, so the owner of Ryugu ought to know him. Maybe you'd be a better one to talk with her, Raidou. We'd be in a pickle if Konnou-Ya went under, that's for sure.  Co.'s sailors a hand. Elfman's holed up in the Catholic Church? Hmm. The only way to get out there is by ship. He's our only lead on Rasputin. I'm assigning you to find a way across. Elfman's dead? Huh... Whoever was posing as him did a good job of filling his shoes. Let's find out who this faker is, Raidou. It's up to us to avenge the dead.  Narumi is unconscious... Owww... Those Navy guys are rougher than my worst hangover. Still, if Yatagarasu is getting involved... That must be the highest of the top brass you substituted for. I don't know what you've gotten yourself into, but... Take care of yourself, Raidou. Waden One is at the peak of Sakuradayama, past Harumi-Cho. Watch yourself, Raidou. The Hiruko are clinging to the radio tower? That thing always looked fishy to me, but I'm worried about what kind of radio waves it's sending out... I have my doubts that heap can actually fly, but... ...No, forget it. There's no time to waste, let's do our jobs. Remember, you're an agent. Your primary objective is to accomplish the mission at any cost. ...Relax, I'm just razzing you. I know you don't have it in you to put your buddy and your demon in danger. I've accepted my fate....When you're right, you're right. But, I want nothing but smiling faces when this is all over. Tae, the owner of Ryugu, Satake, Sadakichi... and Kaya, of course. You're full of surprises, Raidou. I used to think you were a real stick in the mud, but... looks like my winning personality is rubbing off. We can't do business without a client. Bring her back safe. It's all down to you, Raidou. Go look around Tsukudo-Cho for information on the girl who disappeared at Ushigome-gaeri. I'm counting on you. I know it'll be tough, but we're all rooting for you, Raidou. Say, if you run into the Red Cape out there, could you get an interview for me? Off to Fukagawa-Cho? It's risky there, so be careful. Oh! And keep clear of the north side of town, got it? I think our readers would love to know more about the yakuza. Can you interview them for me? An exclusive interview with the kingpin of the Capital underground! What a scoop that'd be! Keep your distance from the Special Guard, Raidou. You guys are my best source! I don't know what I'd do if you had to close down. Love without obstacles is so romantic... But, it doesn't happen to everyone. Eloping, huh...? Just like in the flicks! It's so touching... I'm counting on you, boy. I won't let Konnou-Ya close down while I'm still kicking. I'll go with you. Two will be able to find it easier than one. You can get into the subterranean facility from a hidden entrance north of Kasumidai. Think you can stop Munakata...? I'll sit back and watch the fireworks from here.  Narumi is busy on the phone and can't talk now. "
