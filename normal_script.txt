<start>[7:FF07]> Shinjuku Station... 
<end> 
<start>> It's as quiet as a tomb. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Nothing is showing on 
the giant screen... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You don't know where you are? 
...You're joking, right? 
<end> 
<start>Tokyo, of course! 
<end> 
<start>All of the humans are gone, though. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Hmmm... I just passed through 
Shinjuku, so... 
<end> 
<start>If I go south, I should reach 
Yoyogi and Shibuya. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I just saw a girl heading toward 
Shibuya. 
<end> 
<start>I guess she really was a human... 
<end> 
<start>What? You're a human, too!? 
<end> 
<start>Or... are you a demon? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]*squint* I can see Aoyama over there... 
I think. 
<end> 
<start>Looks like it's safe. 
<end> 
<start>But, you can't get there from here. 
<end> 
<start>I already tried going from 
Yoyogi Park, and that didn't work... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Will you leave the area? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> There is a Mystical Chest. 
Will you open it? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> You did not open 
the Mystical Chest. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 
[2:FF05][3:FF01][2:FF01] x [3:FF02]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You see a Cache Cube. 
Will you open it? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> You did not open 
the Cache Cube. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It's empty. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 
[2:FF05][3:FF01][2:FF01] x [3:FF02]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 
the Magatama [2:FF05][3:FF01][2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 
[2:FF05][3:FF01] Macca[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It's a trap. 
<end> 
<start>> Your party took damage. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It's empty. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> [3:FF03] found something. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]............ 
> You obtained 
[2:FF05][3:FF01][2:FF01] x [3:FF02]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It can't be used here.

<start>[7:FF07]> The light effect wore off. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The repel effect wore off. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The attract effect wore off. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The levitation effect wore off.

<start>[7:FF07]> Message Test 
Next are the choices. 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]Yes, you say? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]No, you say? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...Huh? 
<end> 
<start>How'd you get out of the hospital? 
<end> 
<start>Wasn't Forneus there? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Whatcha lookin' around for? 
This your first time in Tokyo? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]Then, let me tell you something. 
This is Shinjuku, and if you go south 
from here... 
<end> 
<start>...Well, Tokyo's round, so I'm just 
talking relatively here... 
<end> 
<start>If you go south, you'll see 
[2:FF02]Yoyogi Park[2:FF01] and [2:FF02]Shibuya[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>Speaking of which, I saw a human 
head toward Shibuya. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I see... It's my first time here. 
<end> 
<start>Hmm, according to the guide map... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]It's like we're all stuck inside of 
a sphere here in Tokyo. 
<end> 
<start>Hmmm... Ginza isn't on this side of 
the sphere, it seems. 
<end> 
<start>...Man, Tokyo's nothing like 
what the guide map says! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...I see. 
<end> 
<start>Shinjuku, Ginza, Ikebukuro, 
Asakusa... Then, back around to 
Shinjuku. 
<end> 
<start>Tokyo's round, after all... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...I'm getting the hang of it. 
<end> 
<start>The Obelisk of Chiyoda and 
the Amala Temple of Sannou... 
<end> 
<start>These two spots are sandwiching 
Kagutsuchi from the top and bottom. 
<end> 
<start>...Well, there is no up or down in 
Tokyo, since it's round... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]By gum! 
<end> 
<start>It's just like I said... 
The world's all round! 
<end> 
<start>But even now, no one believes me! 
<end> 
<start>I hear prophecies from Jupiter! 
You believe me, don'tcha? *hic* 
<end> 
<start>Of course I do. 
<start>[7:FF07]By gum! Why doesn't anyone 
believe me? *hic* 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Oh! You believe me!? 
<end> 
<start>Then, I'll tell you somethin' good! 
<end> 
<start>The 'Demi-fiend' is the one that's 
going to create the new world... 
<end> 
<start>By gum! You wouldn't be... Naw! 
*hic* 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Hey, if it isn't [12:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>...Have you heard of the Tokyo 
rumor? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]A guy with a strong will is going to 
change this chaotic world... 
<end> 
<start>...That's a good one, huh? 
Tokyo's forever in chaos! 
Hahahahahahaha!! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...Well, it's just a rumor! 
Hahahahahahaha!! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You can see Yoyogi Park from here. 
<end> 
<start>I wonder if the east side of the park 
is being occupied by the fairies. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I saw all these fairies fly off from 
Yoyogi Park. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Kagutsuchi's shining bright... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]LONG TIME NO SEE... 
<end> 
<start>YOUR BEING HERE MEANS THAT 
YOU ARE TRYING TO CREATE 
A NEW WORLD... 
<end> 
<start>I WON'T ALLOW IT! 
<end> 
<start>I DON'T LIKE THE WORLD 
YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKE... 
<end> 
<start>SO... 
<end> 
<start>I WON'T LET YOU GO ANY 
FURTHER!

<start>...ON SECOND THOUGHT... 
<end> 
<start>THE WORLD YOU'RE TRYING TO 
CREATE... 
<end> 
<start>I THINK I WANT TO SEE IT. 
<end> 
<start>ALRIGHT, I WILL HELP YOU 
CREATE THE WORLD! 
<end> 
<start>NO NEED TO WORRY, NOW THAT 
I'M HERE. 
<end> 
<start>HAHAHAHAHAHA! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Cerberus joined your party. 
<end> 
<start>Select your Reason. 
<end> 
<start>Shijima. 
<start>[7:FF07]............ 
<end> 
<start>............ 
<end> 
<start>...Shijima's... Ahriman... 
...How frightening... 
<end> 
<start>...I will share with you... 
the fear... I have felt... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained the [2:FF02]memory of 
the battle against Ahriman[2:FF01]. 
[16:]<start><end> 
<start>Ugh...! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...Shijima's... Ahriman... 
...How frightening... 
<end> 
<start>Ugh...! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The demon disappeared. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]She did it... She did it! 
...We've... won...! 
<end> 
<start>Musubi... is... no more... 
<end> 
<start>I leave you with the power... 
of Yosuga... Make sure to pass... 
on... our legacy...! 
<end>

the battle against Noah[2:FF01]. 
[16:]<start><end> 
<start>Hahaha...... Yosuga... will... 
create the world!!!! 
<end> 
<start>Ugh...! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Dammit... Damn... Musubi! 
<end> 
<start>...But, we have... 
Lady [12:FF04]...... 
<end> 
<start>...Yosuga... will be the ones 
to create the world!!!! 
<end> 
<start>Ugh...! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The demon disappeared. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Will you leave the area? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> There is a Mystical Chest. 
Will you open it? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> You did not open

<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]That hot chick is here, too. 
<end> 
<start>...DAMN, she's hot! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Up ahead, the floor appears and 
disappears. 
<end> 
<start>If you go the wrong way... 
You'll get a taste of gravity. 
<end> 
<start>Darkness awaits you. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]This is one tall tower. 
We're only halfway up? 
<end> 
<start>...Well, no need to worry about 
[12:FF03]. He's eaten all that 
Magatsuhi, after all. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]............ 
<end> 
<start>...Are you the Demi-fiend that beat 
[12:FF03]? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]............ 
<end> 
<start>......Why......? 
<end> 
<start>Why don't you understand Musubi? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]............ 
<end> 
<start>......Liar. 
<end> 
<start>Don't talk to me. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]............ 
<end> 
<start>Are you the Demi-fiend? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]............ 
<end> 
<start>I see...... 
<end> 
<start>Then, go in. [12:FF03] is 
waiting... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]............ 
<end> 
<start>Then... scram... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]............ 
<end> 
<start>A girl...... 
<end> 
<start>......It was a girl...... 
<end> 
<start>[12:FF03] was defeated... 
by... a girl... 
<end> 
<start>...In...side...... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]............ 
<end> 
<start>Even if... we can't create... 
the world of... Musubi... 
<end> 
<start>I'll strive to exist... on my own... 
<end> 
<start>It doesn't... matter... that 
[12:FF03] is dead... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]...Thanks for getting rid of him. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]I'm impressed that he didn't die 
like a mud doll. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]But, he won't get in my way again. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]He had so much Magatsuhi 
stored here. Funny... 
Did he think that a mud doll 
could conceive a Reason? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]...No, it was meant for me... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]This Magatsuhi will allow me 
to affirm my Reason... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:][2:FF03]The god who once died[2:FF01] 
<start>[7:FF07][18:][2:FF03]is returning to us now...[2:FF01] 
<start>[7:FF07][18:][2:FF03]Let us lay the sacred cloth[2:FF01] 
<start>[7:FF07][18:][2:FF03]across the coffin[2:FF01] 
<start>[7:FF07][18:][2:FF03]so the soul will never[2:FF01] 
<start>[7:FF07][18:][2:FF03]leave us again.[2:FF01] 
<start>[7:FF07]By this woman's wish, 
I have come to create 
the kingdom of Yosuga... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I am Baal Avatar, 
paragon of virtue and might, 
bringer of glory. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I see the awakening 
of opposing forces... 
<end> 
<start>One has already emerged 
in Sannou, 
<end> 
<start>and another is about to rise 
in Ginza at this very moment! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I, too, shall endeavor to build 
a kingdom of beauty... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You came all the way here 
just to get killed? Ha ha ha... 
Man, you're stupid. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]If you'd waited until the world 
of Musubi was finished, 
then you would've at least had 
the chance to be born again. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]No one's gonna mess with 
my plans... 
not even an old friend. 
<end> 
<start>Sorry, but it's time to say 
goodbye... forever.

back there at the basement... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]I wouldn't want you to fall prey 
to a [2:FF02]demon[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]You heard what Hikawa said, right? 
<end> 
<start>[18:]The world is about to be engulfed 
by chaos. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]It's called the [2:FF02]Conception[2:FF01]... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]The rebirth of the world, 
an event which no human 
has ever witnessed. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Everyone outside of this hospital 
will perish. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]I doubt anyone would approve 
of such a terrible thing... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]But, even if we let this old world 
continue to exist, it would 
eventually lose all of its power. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]The world must first die, 
for it to be born again... 
<end> 
<start>[18:][7:FF07]And I alone will carry the burden 
of its sin. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]...No, I don't have any regrets. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]You came here, led by fate. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]And it is your fate that you will 
live through the Conception. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]It may actually be more painful 
than death... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]But... I believe in you. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:][12:FF01]... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]...Please find me. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]No matter how the world changes, 
I'll be your strength. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]As the Maiden, I'll take part in 
the creation of the new world... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]I'm sure that I'll be able to 
provide you with guidance. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]...I know it's difficult for you 
to understand. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]But, we're out of time. 
<end> 
<start>[18:][12:FF01]... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]If you can find me on your own, 
<end> 
<start>[18:]I promise that I'll tell you 
everything... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]...The answers to all your questions, 
<end> 
<start>[18:]and what my true feelings are... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...It is time to settle this, 
once and for all. 
<end> 
<start>Let us see whether or not you can 
best the four knights of death... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Can a human with the strength 
of a demon... 
<end> 
<start>overcome the inevitable fate 
of death...? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I shall pass final judgement 
on you! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 
the [2:FF02]Candelabrum of Majesty[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Oh... I wasn't expecting you, 
[12:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]My master is resting right now. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]If you're here for information, 
I'd be glad to help you. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]...Is there anything else you want 
to ask about, [12:FF01]? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]...Alright. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]I'll try to help you as much as I can. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]So, what is it that you'd like 
to know about? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]...Then, you should get going. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]I look forward to seeing you again... 
<end> 
<start>I want to ask you about something. 
<start>The Vortex World 
<start>The Vortex World 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Okay... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Listen closely. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]...Then, you should get going. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]I look forward to seeing you again... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> ...The lady in black and the old 
gentleman in the wheelchair have 
disappeared. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]You have returned, [12:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Have you decided to come meet 
my master? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Then, we will be waiting in 
the deepest part of the Labyrinth. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]I will open the way to the last door; 
please use the candelabrum and 
come see us. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]We look forward to seeing you 
soon. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]I see... I understand that it is 
a difficult decision to make. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]There is still time; 
if you decide to help my master, 
please come back to this place. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]We will be waiting for you. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Well, hello. 
...I knew you would come. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]You heard about what's happening 
here, right? 
<end> 
<start>[18:]The existence of a power that 
can change the world... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...I'm sorry that I disappeared 
after you saved me. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]It was my god who did that; 
I couldn't do anything about it... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...I lost most of my power, 
thanks to Hikawa and his Obelisk. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]But, my god has been protecting me 
since then, 
and I'm doing much better now. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Hikawa won't be able to 
take control of me again. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]...I won't let him be the one 
to shape the new world. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]What he envisions is a world 
where the thread of time is 
spun unerringly, without change... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]You can't call that a world. 
It's just wasted space, 
totally devoid of power. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]To restrain the reborn world 
like that would be unforgivable. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]As the one responsible for 
the destruction of the old world, 
it's my duty to shape the new one. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]The world cannot remain 
in a state of chaos, 
nor can it fall prey to 
Hikawa's ambitions. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]But right now, 
there's nothing I can do... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]My god has spoken to me, 
but she has yet to reveal 
the Reason... 
<end> 
<start>...... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]You know what's been going on 
here lately? 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Well, it's all because of 
the [2:FF02]Yahirono Himorogi[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]The [2:FF02]Yahirono Himorogi[2:FF01] is a stone 
that contains an enormous amount 
of Magatsuhi. It grants tremendous 
power to its possessor. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Word spread that the stone 
is somewhere in Yoyogi Park, 
and now everybody is trying to 
claim it for their own. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]...I'm not interested in Magatsuhi, 
but the stone is rumored to have 
the power to control even gods. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Once I have that power... 
I'll be worthy of receiving 
the Reason from my god. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Currently, the [2:FF02]Yahirono Himorogi[2:FF01] 
is in someone's possession. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]I'm not sure who, 
but I can sense a strong, 
evil power. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Their power is so strong that 
I wouldn't stand a chance 
against it... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]But, I think you would. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]If I promise to give you 
the Magatsuhi contained 
inside it... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]...will you try to get 
the [2:FF02]Yahirono Himorogi[2:FF01] for me? 
<end> 
<start>Okay. 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Thank you so much. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]By the way, you couldn't get into 
the park before, right? 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Here, take this. 
It's the key to that locked door. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]I see... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]...I want you to know that 
you're the only one I feel like 
I can rely on in this world. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Even if you say no, 
I'll still have faith in you. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]You weren't able to get inside 
the park before, right? 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Here, take this. 
It's the key to that locked door. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]The choice is yours, but... 
I believe in you. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]If you're having doubts, 
then I really shouldn't force you 
to do it, but... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]...you're the only one that 
I can rely on in this world. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Even if you say no, 
I'll still have faith in you. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]You weren't able to get inside 
the park before, right? 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Here, take this. 
It's the key to that locked door. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]The choice is yours, but... 
I believe in you. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained the [2:FF02]key to Yoyogi Park[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]I'll be counting on you, 
[12:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Goodbye, [12:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]I'll be here waiting for you... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:][12:FF01], please bring me 
the [2:FF02]Yahirono Himorogi[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>There is no one else in this world 
who I can rely on... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:][12:FF01]... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]You didn't agree to get 
the [2:FF02]Yahirono Himorogi[2:FF01] for me, 
but... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]I believe in you. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Goodbye, [12:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]I'll be here waiting for you... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Not bad. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]You look like a demon... 
but you don't seem like one. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]My name is Dante. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]I'm a demon slayer. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]This old guy asked me to hunt down 
guys like you, but... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...Forget it. 
Let's just stop this battle here. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]I need to find out what that guy 
really has in mind. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Depending on how things turn out, 
maybe we'll meet again. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Until then, try and keep 
yourself alive. 
...Who knows? Maybe I'll have 
another chance to kill you. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]So, be prepared for the worst. 
...Don't say I didn't warn ya. 
<start>[7:FF07]There you are, Fiend. 
<start>[7:FF07]Let's see what you've got. 
<start>[7:FF07]Glad to meet you, kid. 
I hope you feel the same. 
<start>[7:FF07]*sigh* Thank god it's just you. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]I thought I was ambushed. 
Don't scare me like that! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...Well, you look like you're alright. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]I'm sorry about what happened 
last time. Yeah, I screwed up... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]But, it worked out for the best. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]I had no idea they had a base 
this big... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]If I had used that thing correctly, 
you would have been here 
all by yourself. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]...I have some idea what's going on. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Mantra launched their assault 
at just the right time. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Thanks to them, 
my arrival went unnoticed. 
<end> 
<start>...... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Hey, this might sound crazy, but... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Did you join the Mantra? 
<end> 
<start>Yeah, I did. 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]...I see. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Well, it's your decision, 
so I won't say anything... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Oh, so it's just a rumor. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]You seem so much stronger, 
I thought it might be true. 
...Oh well. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]This entire room is a facility 
for collecting Magatsuhi. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]We're at the center of that big hole 
you see from outside. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]It was destroyed during the assault, 
and now it's completely shut down. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]But, this place was filled 
with tons of Magatsuhi 
just a moment ago. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Those Mantra guys beat the hell 
outta this place. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]I don't blame them... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Anybody would assume that this is 
the core of Nihilo. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]They just left here, acting like 
they ruled the world... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]...not realizing that Hikawa 
fooled them. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I wouldn't have known either, 
if I didn't use the Amala Network 
to get here. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]...The flow of Magatsuhi seems 
a little strange. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]It's cleverly disguised, 
but this is just bait. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]The real core must be located 
somewhere else inside the base. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]...And that's where Hikawa will be. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Damn it, I better not stick around 
much longer... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The commotion caused by 
the Mantra has pretty much 
died down. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]It'll be even more dangerous now. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]I wanted to meet Hikawa in person, 
but... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]I'm not gonna fool myself. 
I know I won't survive that long. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]On your way here, did you see 
a corridor that you couldn't enter, 
one that was spinning? 
<end> 
<start>[18:]I deactivated it, 
so you should be able to 
go through it now. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]That's about all the help I can offer. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]...It's up to you to decide 
how to deal with Hikawa. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]You've come this far... 
If you turn back now, 
you'll regret it, right? 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Alright then... See ya. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]This will be a large terminal. Entry is 
prohibited because it is under 
construction. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]This will be a small terminal. It is 
under construction, but it can link to 
the big terminal. 
<end> 
<start>Do you wish to link it? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> It won't open from this side. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Looks like this tunnel leads to 
Asakusa. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][7:FF07]What!? 
<end> 
<start>This is my home, y'know!! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I hear that there's oni living in 
this tunnel. 
<end> 
<start>And 4 of 'em, on top of that. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Hey, you!! That's dangerous! 
<end> 
<start>Stay behind the white line!! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Dammit!! 
<end> 
<start>I forgot to read the latest issue of 
Ayakashi Monthly!! 
<end> 
<start>Is there one in the trash? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]There are some oni living deep in 
the tunnels. 
<end> 
<start>Getting to Asakusa is the easy part. 
Wait until you encounter 'bigger' 
problems there! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You trying to get to Asakusa? 
<end> 
<start>Then, you'll need a couple of those 
Light Balls. 
<end> 
<start>Otherwise, you'll be living in 
the dark... Literally! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Do you know? 
<end> 
<start>The oni Ongyo-ki hides himself and 
avoids enemies. 
<end> 
<start>But, I think he'll come out if his 
partners are defeated. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You came from Ikebukuro? 
<end> 
<start>And you weren't attacked by oni??? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Sometimes... I can hears the voice 
of an oni from this here platform! 
<end> 
<start>Whoa! What the hell was that?! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Once you exit, Asakusa's right there. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I saw a young man your age at 
Asakusa, come to think of it... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]............ 
<end> 
<start>...WHAT DO YOU WANT? 
<end> 
<start>I AM KIN-KI. YOU FILTHY DOG... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Kin-ki is not listening. What will 
you do? 
<end> 
<start>Introduce yourself. 
<start>[7:FF07]............ 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...WHAT, YOU'RE THAT...!? 
<end> 
<start>DAMN DEMON-HUMAN FREAK!! 
<end> 
<start>SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST!! 
<end> 
<start>I WILL HUNT YOU DOWN!! 
<start>[7:FF07]> Kin-ki's breathing is getting heavier. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...I've never seen you before. 
<end> 
<start>I'm Sui-ki. 
<end> 
<start>I'm a cold demon. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I won't do anything to ya, so come 
over here... 
<end> 
<start>Okay. 
<start>[7:FF07]Hahaha! You coward. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Then, die! 
<start>[7:FF07]Heh... 
<end> 
<start>You got some guts. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You really want to have some fun 
with me, huh? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]So come here, will ya? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Ew... 
<end> 
<start>Not with a guy, man. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Yee-haw! 
<end> 
<start>I'm Fuu-ki. 
<end> 
<start>You must have some time on your 
hands, making it all the way down 
here. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Give me some cash, then I can hook 
you up with some hot babes. 
<end> 
<start>Sounds good to me. 
<start>[7:FF07]Alright, 100 Macca. 
<end> 
<start>Sure. 
<start>[7:FF07]Alright! You know how to make 
things fun! 
<end> 
<start>Now, let's try the next level! 
100 Macca more! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]So close! Sooo close, man! 
<end> 
<start>Just 100 Macca more, really! Then, 
it's a done deal! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]1...2...3... Alright. 
<end> 
<start>Now, get outta here!! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I'm sorry! Please! Don't hurt me! 
<end> 
<start>C'mon, I beg of you! 
<end> 
<start>Ha... Yeah, right! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Take this, loser! 
<start>[7:FF07]You don't even have enough money. 
I have no business with poor 
people. 
<end> 
<start>Make like a tree and get outta here! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> No one is here... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You sense a strong power from 
beyond the door... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]My name is Ongyo-ki... 
<end> 
<start>Are you the one who slew my 
partners and awakened me!? 
<end> 
<start>I sliced and diced them. 
<start>[7:FF07]You cannot fool me!! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Insolent fool!!!! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Learn your weakness through my 
illusions! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Will you leave the area? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> There is a Mystical Chest. 
Will you open it? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> You did not open 
the Mystical Chest. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 
[2:FF05][3:FF01][2:FF01] x [3:FF02]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You see a Cache Cube. 
Will you open it? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> You did not open 
the Cache Cube. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It's empty. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 
[2:FF05][3:FF01][2:FF01] x [3:FF02]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 
the Magatama [2:FF05][3:FF01][2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 
[2:FF05][3:FF01] Macca[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It's a trap. 
<end> 
<start>> Your party took damage. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It's empty. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> [3:FF03] found something. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]............ 
> You obtained 
[2:FF05][3:FF01][2:FF01] x [3:FF02]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It can't be used here. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The light effect wore off. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The repel effect wore off. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The attract effect wore off. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The levitation effect wore off. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Select a floor. 
<end> 
<start>[3:FF01][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF02][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF03][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF04][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF05][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF06][80EA] 
<start>[7:FF07]The passage at the end of this 
station goes all the way to Asakusa. 
<end> 
<start>It's called the Ikebukuro Tunnel. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]A big group of Manikins went 
downstairs. 
<end> 
<start>...My guess is, they're gonna try and 
revive the city of Asakusa. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Mifunashiro attacked... Futomimi 
killed... It's over for the Manikins. 
<end> 
<start>...The Vortex world is a tough place 
to live in. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]What!? 
<end> 
<start>I'm sleeping. Don't bother me! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]There are other tunnels like this all 
over! 
<end> 
<start>They're all important, as they 
connect different areas together... 
<end> 
<start>...But, actually, no one really uses 
them... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You're heading for Asakusa, too? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]...Well, since you're here, why don't 
you try walking in the [2:FF02]dark[2:FF01]? 
<end> 
<start>Seriously, you can't see a thing in 
there! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Then, you'll need something that'll 
[2:FF02]light[2:FF01] up the way. 
<end> 
<start>They sell it somewhere... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Oni! 
<end> 
<start>There's oni inside! 
<end> 
<start>Well, I'm an oni, too, but I ran into 
a [2:FF02]strong oni[2:FF01] inside! 
<end> 
<start>Plus, I hear there's a total of 
[2:FF02]four oni[2:FF01]... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Oni! 
<end> 
<start>Someone beat the four oni! 
<end> 
<start>Did you know? 
<end> 
<start>I know. 
<start>[7:FF07]...Geez, that must be some crazy 
demon, beating those four. 
<end> 
<start>I'd like to get a glimpse of him! Too 
bad all I see is you... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I see... 
<end> 
<start>It's big news to us oni... You need to 
keep up with the world, man. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]............ 
<end> 
<start>...No, those four were insanely 
strong! I could tell... 
<end> 
<start>You wouldn't be able to handle even 
one. Don't lie! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...I got separated from my group. 
<end> 
<start>There are four ex-Mantra oni here. 
They're scary. 
<end> 
<start>The leader oni's gonna come out if 
you defeat the other three, and he's 
really scary! 
<end> 
<start>...In other words, I'm scared. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]In a world where god remains 
silent... 
<end> 
<start>Do you find yourself in need of 
guidance? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]............ 
<end> 
<start>............ 
<end> 
<start>............ 
<end> 
<start>...Very well. 
<end> 
<start>Take this... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained [2:FF05]Light Ball[2:FF01] x 1. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]This is nothing, considering it's for 
the sake of this world. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Please be careful... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I see... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]My friend told me that he ran into 
an oni after falling into a hole. 
<end> 
<start>...I didn't see an oni on this floor, 
though. 
<end> 
<start>Thank goodness... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You came from Ikebukuro? 
<end> 
<start>Were you attacked by an oni? 
Luckily, I wasn't... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Kuramae Station--! 
<end> 
<start>The end of the Ikebukuro Line--! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You can get to the city of Asakusa 
from the exit. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Asakusa is north of the exit. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Is there anything good on the floor? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> Add which candelabrum to 
your inventory? 
<end> 
<start>Compassion 
<start>[7:FF07]What do you want to do? 
<end> 
<start>Black Visor flag on 
<start>Black Visor flag on 
<start>[7:FF07]> The hole is blocked... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The path is blocked... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> There is a shaft leading downward. 
<end> 
<start>> Jump in? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Return to the entrance 
of the Labyrinth? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Return to the previous Kalpa? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> There is a huge pedestal. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You do not have a candelabrum 
for this pedestal... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Will you light the [2:FF02]Candelabrum 
of Compassion[2:FF01]? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Will you light the [2:FF02]Candelabrum 
of Wisdom[2:FF01]? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Will you light the [2:FF02]Candelabrum 
of Insight[2:FF01]? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> You lit the [2:FF02]Candelabrum 
of Compassion[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You lit the [2:FF02]Candelabrum 
of Wisdom[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You lit the [2:FF02]Candelabrum 
of Insight[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> All of the candelabra 
have been lit... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The flames illuminate the passage 
beyond. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> There is a peephole... 
<end> 
<start>> Will you look through it? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Please retrieve the next set 
of Candelabra and return them 
to the Labyrinth. 
<end> 
<start>We are deeply grateful for 
your work. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The voice of the lady in black 
can be heard through the peephole... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The lady's voice could no longer 
be heard. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Dante exited through the door... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Dante exited through the door... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It seems as if someone 
is watching you... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Hey kid... Didn't I tell you 
to lay low? 
<end> 
<start>Playtime's over. Now... 
<end> 
<start>Let's rock! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...Don't disappoint me. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...A game's no fun if you 
don't know the rules. 
So, here's the deal... 
<end> 
<start>To get past here, 
you need to turn on 
all the [2:FF02]switches[2:FF01] first. 
<end> 
<start>Alright, I'm gonna count to three. 
That's how long you've got 
to come up with a plan. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]One... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Two... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...Three! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> There is a switch. 
Will you activate it? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The switch has been activated. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Dante left... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The door is tightly shut... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Will you try to open it? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Before I allow you to pass through, 
I shall test your strength. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Before I allow you to pass through, 
I shall test your magic. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Before I allow you to pass through, 
I shall test your luck. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I cannot let one with such feeble 
strength pass through! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I cannot let one with such weak 
magic pass through! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I cannot let one with such meager 
luck pass through! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Your strength is worthy of praise! 
You may pass. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Your magic is worthy of praise! 
You may pass. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Your luck is worthy of praise! 
You may pass. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The flames of the [2:FF02]Candelabrum 
of Sovereignty[2:FF01] are flickering wildly... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> There is a tombstone without 
a name on it... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Will you put on the Black Visor? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The inscription on the tombstone 
changed. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The inscription on the tombstone 
remained the same. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> "Record of Kin-Ki: 
Defeated in [3:FF01] turn(s)." 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> "Record of Kin-Ki:

Black Frost... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The flames of the [2:FF02]Candelabrum 
of Sovereignty[2:FF01] started to flicker 
wildly... 
<end> 
<start>> You feel a terrifying presence 
in the air... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...Well met, you who was once 
human. 
<end> 
<start>The moment you stepped into 
this Labyrinth, the wheel of fate 
began to spin... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Time is a loop that repeats itself. 
<end> 
<start>But, we serve the fallen angel 
in order to rise above that fate. 
<end> 
<start>You wish for the same thing, 
do you not? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...We know that thou art on a quest 
to retrieve the candelabra. 
<end> 
<start>We, the four knights of death, 
have what thou seekest. 
<end> 
<start>Thine they shall be, 
if thou canst triumph over us. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][13:FF01], 
the Demi-fiend... 
<end> 
<start>You have conquered a number 
of deaths to reach here. 
<end> 
<start>Whether it be you, or one of us... 
<end> 
<start>...it is our master's wish that 
one Fiend survives this battle 
over the candelabra. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]And when his wish comes true... 
<end> 
<start>...he shall make the decision to 
lead his army to the final battle. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Do you have the resolve to face us 
in battle? 
<end> 
<start>Even if it may cost you what is left 
of your humanity? 
<end> 
<start>My mind's made up. 
<start>[7:FF07]Very well. That is just the answer 
we were expecting. 
<end> 
<start>...Then, show us the strength that 
our master stakes our fate on. 
<end> 
<start>We, the four knights of death, 
shall await you in the Vortex World. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...Then, we are through with you. 
<end> 
<start>The wish of our master, 
and of all the demons of chaos... 
shall never be realized. 
<end> 
<start>Nevertheless, your betrayal cannot 
be forgiven. 
<end> 
<start>Prepare for your doom! 
<end> 
<start>The four knights of death shall 
claim your head! We await you 
in the Vortex World! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The four horsemen disappeared... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The door is tightly shut... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> ...... 
<end> 
<start>> The door would not budge... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Only one loyal to neither light 
nor darkness may pass... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Only a servant of light may pass... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Only a servant of darkness 
may pass... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Glory be to the demon who walks 
the path untouched by both light 
and darkness... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Glory be to the demon of light... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Glory be to the demon of darkness... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Gee, you look worn out. 
<end> 
<start>Would you like to rest for a while? 
Only 500 Macca! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Oh... Well, please come again! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Oh, you don't have enough Macca... 
Come back when you do. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You must be thirsty. 
Here, have a drink... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Your party recovered. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Go ahead, have some more... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Are you feeling better? 
Here's some more... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Your party recovered some more. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...Have... another... drink... 
<start>[7:FF07]> Your wallet feels really light... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You hear a voice... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Heeeeee hoooooo! 
I guess I'm a little too late. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I tried so hard to get here, too! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You do remember me, right? 
<end> 
<start>The "Emperor of Kabukicho" 
has finally made his comeback!! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Um, if you're wondering how 
I managed to make a comeback... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF04]...that's a secret. 
<end> 
<start>Don't ask me why I shrank in size, 
either. Okay, hee ho? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Anyway, once again I'm aiming 
to be the best! 
<end> 
<start>If I tag along with you, hee ho, 
I think I can become super-cool 
and super-strong! 
<end> 
<start>So, let's go! Heeeeee hoooooo!! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Anyway, once again I'm aiming 
to be the best! 
<end> 
<start>If I tag along with you, hee ho, 
I think I can become super-cool 
and super-strong! 
<end> 
<start>So, let's... 
<end> 
<start>What the!? 
I'm in your party already! 
Ho noooooo! 
<end> 
<start>I'm no use to you...? 
Fine, be that way! 
I'm going home!! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Black Frost joined you without 
your consent... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Black Frost left... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Black Frost couldn't join you 
because your party was full... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Ho hee?! You have too many 
demons with you! Why, hee ho!? 
<end> 
<start>I'll wait for you, hee ho, 
at the Cathedral of Shadows! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Black Frost disappeared... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]What's the matter, kid? 
Tired already? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]What's the matter, kid? 
Tired already? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The game's not over yet... 
I [2:FF02]reset[2:FF01] all the switches. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]What's the matter, kid? 
Tired already? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I recently got a hold of this rare 
item, but nobody seems to 
understand its value... 
<end> 
<start>How about you? Would you be 
interested in buying it? 
<end> 
<start>This stone, called a Deathstone, 
is supposed to bring death to you. 
But, who knows? Maybe you'll find 
a use for it. 
<end> 
<start>You can have it for the bargain 
price of 100000 Macca. Well, 
how 'bout it? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Heheh, I knew you'd want it. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]That's fine. 
If you change your mind, 
feel free to come back anytime. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I recently got a hold of this rare 
item, but nobody seems to 
understand its value... 
<end> 
<start>I'd consider selling it to you, 
if you were a little stronger. 
<end> 
<start>I can tell you right now, though, 
that it'll be expensive. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Hey hey hey, you don't have 
enough Macca. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You purchased the Deathstone 
from the Shady Broker. 
<end> 
<start>Alright, I'll buy it. 
<start>[7:FF07]> Will you leave the area? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> There is a Mystical Chest. 
Will you open it? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> You did not open 
the Mystical Chest. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 
[2:FF05][3:FF01][2:FF01] x [3:FF02]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You see a Cache Cube. 
Will you open it? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> You did not open 
the Cache Cube. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It's empty. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 
[2:FF05][3:FF01][2:FF01] x [3:FF02]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 
the Magatama [2:FF05][3:FF01][2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 
[2:FF05][3:FF01] Macca[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It's a trap. 
<end> 
<start>> Your party took damage. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It's empty. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> [3:FF03] found something. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]............ 
> You obtained 
[2:FF05][3:FF01][2:FF01] x [3:FF02]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It can't be used here. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The light effect wore off. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The repel effect wore off. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The attract effect wore off. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The levitation effect wore off. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Select a floor. 
<end> 
<start>[3:FF01][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF02][80EA]

<start>[3:FF04][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF05][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF06][80EA] 
<start>[7:FF07]> Message Test. 
First, the basics... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Message Test. 
Next are the choices... 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]Yes, you say? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]No, you say? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Will you break your promise 
with Dante and proceed? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> The door is locked... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You used the [2:FF02]Star Key[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Do me a favor... 
<end> 
<start>Don't bother me. 
<end> 
<start>My pleasure. 
<start>[7:FF07]...... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...... 
<end> 
<start>...Then, give me 10000 Macca. 
If you don't like it, then go 
somewhere else. So, do you want 
my help or not? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> ...... 
<end> 
<start>> Dr. Dark healed your party. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I see hesitation in your heart. 
<end> 
<start>Life or death... You must choose... 
even if choice defies reason. 
<end> 
<start>I can see it. Your inclination 
is taking form... 
<end> 
<start>Would you like to know why your 
soul wavers? 
<end> 
<start>Tell me. 
<start>[7:FF07]Imagine that you're in a desert... 
<end> 
<start>A turtle walks up to you. 
<end> 
<start>You flip the turtle over, leaving it 
on its back. 
<end> 
<start>It struggles to right itself, 
but to no avail. For what reason 
did you flip the turtle? 
<end> 
<start>You did so because of the distress 
in your heart. The helpless turtle 
is you! 
<end> 
<start>If you look at things upside-down, 
of course they will appear inverted. 
<end> 
<start>Forget your worries and move on. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I see. Then be on your way. 
<end> 
<start>Your destination is predetermined; 
it cannot be altered. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]"This is the story of a future 
not so far off... 
<end> 
<start>where death conquers death, 
and fire lights the darkness... 
<end> 
<start>The words of the beginning shall 
be spoken. 
<end> 
<start>...We all await those words." 
<end> 
<start>............ 
<end> 
<start>I heard that from a demon in 
the Labyrinth. I wonder what 
it means... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The path is blocked... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]It's natural for every living thing 
to die... Therefore, medical 
treatment contradicts nature. 
<end> 
<start>So... Did you come here to defy 
nature and be treated? 
<end> 
<start>No. 
<start>[7:FF07]Good. One lives, one dies... 
That's the way it should be. 
<end> 
<start>I pray that you find rest soon. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...I'm a doctor, after all. 
I'll treat your wounds. 
<end> 
<start>But, I'm gonna charge you 
[3:FF01] Macca. Alright? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> ...... 
<end> 
<start>> Dr. Dark healed your party. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...... 
<end> 
<start>Money first. Get outta here. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The door up ahead will test your 
luck. 
<end> 
<start>If you're unlucky, you won't even be 
able to set foot inside the room. 
<end> 
<start>Even if you do manage to get in, 
there's no telling where you'll 
end up... 
<end> 
<start>So, tell me... Are you feelin' lucky? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Hold on! Are you planning to go 
through that door?! 
<end> 
<start>Dude, forget it. Only someone 
strong like me can go in there! 
<end> 
<start>A puny wimp like you won't be able 
to get in. 
<end> 
<start>There are more doors like it inside... 
Even I can't get through some of 
them! 
<end> 
<start>If you wanna get in, you better build 
some muscle. Right now, you're just 
a little girlie-man. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]This floor has three types of special 
doors. 
<end> 
<start>You need a certain amount of 
power, luck or magic to enter 
each door. 
<end> 
<start>The door up ahead is one of them. 
If you're going in, you better 
be prepared. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The Labyrinth of Amala used to have 
some incredible treasure. 
<end> 
<start>But, I heard some group stole it... 
I don't know the details, though. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Hee ho! 
<end> 
<start>I saw an awesome dude with guns 
and a giant sword mowing down 
demons, hee ho! 
<end> 
<start>It was terrifying! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Hee ho!! 
<end> 
<start>The Emperor has returned!! 
<end> 
<start>I want his autograph, hee ho, 
so I'm gonna go look for him!! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...I'm glad you made it here. 
<end> 
<start>...If you get stronger... 
<end> 
<start>...I'll sell you something special. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...I've got nothing else to sell you. 
...Hey, don't worry. 
<end> 
<start>I'm sure there are other brokers 
besides me in this labyrinth. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...You're pretty strong. 
<end> 
<start>...I'll sell you something special. 
Interested? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...On second thought, forget what 
I just said. 
<end> 
<start>The demon you have there... 
Yeah, that scary one with large 
eyes... 
<end> 
<start>As long as you've got that demon 
with you, I can't sell you mine. 
Come back after you get rid of it. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...On second thought, forget what 
I just said. 
<end> 
<start>The demon you have there... 
Yeah, the one that looks like it's 
always hungry... 
<end> 
<start>As long as you've got that demon 
with you, I can't sell you mine. 
Come back after you get rid of it. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...You're pretty strong. 
<end> 
<start>I'll sell you something special. 
<end> 
<start>...Wait a minute, your party's full. 
<end> 
<start>If you want a new companion, 
make some room first and then 
come back. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Here's what I'm selling... 
<end> 
<start>...a demon with a body of steel. 
It'll be useful in battle. 
<end> 
<start>Nothing can harm this demon! 
It can't even be scratched! 
<end> 
<start>I'm asking 70000 Macca. 
I know it's kinda high, but it's well 
worth the price... So, you want it? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Here's what I'm selling... 
<end> 
<start>...a demon of darkness with 
a powerful skill... 
<end> 
<start>I'm telling you, this one's got 
some potential! 
<end> 
<start>...I-I can't stress enough 
the potential it has! I personally 
recommend it! 
<end> 
<start>I'm asking 150000 Macca. 
I know it's kinda high, but it's well 
worth the price... So, you want it? 
<end> 
<start>Alright, I'll buy it. 
<start>[7:FF07]Excellent choice! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You purchased a demon from 
the Shady Broker. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I am Kaja Mitama. 
<end> 
<start>With my magic, I can weaken 
the enemy. 
<end> 
<start>Let me know when I am needed. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The demon joined your party. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]That's fine. If you change your mind, 
feel free to come back anytime. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Hey, you don't have enough Macca! 
<end> 
<start>Come back when you have more 
money, okay? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Hey, you're not going on ahead, 
are you? 
<end> 
<start>If you are, you better be ready. 
<end> 
<start>I saw a guy with guns and a huge 
sword walk in not long ago. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Looks like you're safe. That's good 
to know. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> There is mud left lying around. 
<end> 
<start>> The mud is shaped somewhat like 
a human. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> There is a stain in the shape of 
a human. 
<end> 
<start>> Something is in its hand. 
Will you take it? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained the [2:FF02]Afterlife Bell[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> There is a stain in the shape of 
a human. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Halt! 
<end> 
<start>This is the [2:FF02]Assembly of Nihilo[2:FF01], 
the place for those who seek 
silence. 
<end> 
<start>I cannot let anyone see 
our commander or the Maiden. 
<end> 
<start>Leave these grounds immediately! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Will you leave the area? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> There is a Mystical Chest. 
Will you open it? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> You did not open 
the Mystical Chest. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 
[2:FF05][3:FF01][2:FF01] x [3:FF02]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You see a Cache Cube. 
Will you open it? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> You did not open 
the Cache Cube. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It's empty. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 
[2:FF05][3:FF01][2:FF01] x [3:FF02]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 
the Magatama [2:FF05][3:FF01][2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 
[2:FF05][3:FF01] Macca[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It's a trap. 
<end> 
<start>> Your party took damage. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It's empty. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> [3:FF03] found something. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]............ 
> You obtained 
[2:FF05][3:FF01][2:FF01] x [3:FF02]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It can't be used here. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The light effect wore off. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The repel effect wore off. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The attract effect wore off. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The levitation effect wore off. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Select a floor. 
<end> 
<start>[3:FF01][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF02][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF03][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF04][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF05][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF06][80EA] 
<start>[7:FF07]If you travel north from here, 
you'll reach [2:FF02]Ikebukuro[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>All the Mantra demons are there. 
May their souls rest in peace... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I heard Gozu-Tennoh was defeated. 
May his soul rest in peace... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I hear something's going on at 
the Mantra's headquarters. 
May their souls rest in peace... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I heard the ghost of Gozu-Tennoh 
went inside a human girl. 
<end> 
<start>Yosuga, was it? 
May their souls rest in peace... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]............ 
<end> 
<start>The Manikin over there died... 
<end> 
<start>He died the instant he became 
human. 
<end> 
<start>You see, humans can't live 
in the Vortex World... 
May his soul rest in peace... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]We, the believers of Shijima, will 
follow Commander Hikawa and 
conquer the tower! 
<end> 
<start>There is no way that fools like you 
can accomplish such a feat! 
<end> 
<start>Hahahahahahaha! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]We, the believers of Shijima, will 
follow Commander Hikawa and 
conquer the tower! 
<end> 
<start>Oh, [13:FF01]! 
<end> 
<start>Our battle has begun. 
<end> 
<start>Please rest here, and fight for 
the sake of Shijima. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]......!! 
<end> 
<start>You're [13:FF01]! 
<end> 
<start>Infidel! You come to break our 
stillness!? 
<end> 
<start>Leave!! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][13:FF01]! Nice work. 
<end> 
<start>Lord Hikawa and the other Reason 
leaders have all headed upward. 
<end> 
<start>Lord Hikawa started later, but he 
must have something in mind. 
<end> 
<start>Please, help our Lord create 
the world of Shijima! I'm cheering 
you on! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Noooo! It's [13:FF01]! 
<end> 
<start>Help me! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]YOU...... SUCK...... 
<end> 
<start>LEAVE ME...... ALONE. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][13:FF01]? 
<end> 
<start>YOU CAN PASS.  
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]............ 
<end> 
<start>............ 
<end> 
<start>............ 
<end> 
<start>...SHUT UP. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Well, hang in there, okay? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]D-Don't mind me... 
<end> 
<start>Leave me alone. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Weaklings like you aren't allowed to 
walk alongside the followers of 
Yosuga! 
<end> 
<start>Get lost! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]O demon of noble blood, welcome. 
<end> 
<start>Come! 
Let us fight together! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Inferior being! You're an inferior 
being! 
<end> 
<start>Only the strong may make it to 
the top of Kagutsuchi! 
<end> 
<start>You have no right to be here! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]This is debug. I wasted my time on 
debug. 
<end> 
<start>I've had enough of this. 
<end> 
<start>That's it, I'm gone. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]An inferior being! 
<end> 
<start>Help me!! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Hey [13:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> More goddamn debug. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]See you. Good luck! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Good luck. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Hello. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The creation is near... 
<end> 
<start>No, really! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I'm sorry, please forgive me! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The other paths are filled with 
demons. 
<end> 
<start>The only path remaining is this one. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Who will create the world? Who will 
become god? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Will they be nice to us in the new 
world? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Chiaki = debug. 
<end> 
<start>Ugh. 
<end> 
<start>Is this file entirely debug? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Us Manikins want to see the world 
created from here. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...Please wait. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]O noble Demi-fiend, I am honored 
to meet you! 
<end> 
<start>I am Samael. 
<end> 
<start>Commander Hikawa has ordered me 
to assist you in your quest. 
<end> 
<start>You are now the embodiment of 
Shijima... 
<end> 
<start>I would be honored to accompany 
you. 
<end> 
<start>Will you allow me to join? 
<end> 
<start>Yeah, please join. 
<start>[7:FF07]...Very well! I forfeit my life to you. 
<end> 
<start>Now, let us go. 
<end> 
<start>> Samael has joined your party. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You do not need me, you say? 
<end> 
<start>Such strength... I see why 
Commander Hikawa thinks so highly 
of you. 
<end> 
<start>Then, I shall wait to be summoned at 
the Cathedral of Shadows. 
<end> 
<start>I wish you luck. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Samael left. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]......Hm? 
<end> 
<start>It seems that you have enough 
members to handle things... 
<end> 
<start>I shall wait to be summoned at 
the Cathedral of Shadows. 
<end> 
<start>I wish you luck. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Debuggy. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Select your Reason. 
<end> 
<start>Shijima. 
<start>[7:FF07]Warp after warp. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Return to the Obelisk? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> Will you leave the area? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> There is a Mystical Chest. 
Will you open it? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> You did not open 
the Mystical Chest. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 
[2:FF05][3:FF01][2:FF01] x [3:FF02]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You see a Cache Cube. 
Will you open it? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> You did not open 
the Cache Cube. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It's empty. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 
[2:FF05][3:FF01][2:FF01] x [3:FF02]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 
the Magatama [2:FF05][3:FF01][2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 
[2:FF05][3:FF01] Macca[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It's a trap. 
<end> 
<start>> Your party took damage. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It's empty. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> [3:FF03] found something. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]............ 
> You obtained 
[2:FF05][3:FF01][2:FF01] x [3:FF02]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It can't be used here. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The light effect wore off. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The repel effect wore off. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The attract effect wore off. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The levitation effect wore off. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Select a floor. 
<end> 
<start>[3:FF01][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF02][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF03][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF04][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF05][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF06][80EA] 
<start>[7:FF07]> You sense a strong power from 
beyond the door. 
<end> 
<start>> Will you enter? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> The door is closed tight. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]We Manikins have also climbed this 
tower. 
<end> 
<start>We've always been looking up. 
We've always wondered about 
Kagutsuchi. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]A tower coming from Kagutsuchi, 
the Obelisk shrinking... It's all weird. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Don't forget about us when creating 
the world. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]What Reason are you here to 
cheer on? 
<end> 
<start>Yosuga. 
<start>[7:FF07]............ 
<end> 
<start>...Don't bully me, okay? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]............ 
<end> 
<start>...Talk to me sometimes, okay? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]............ 
<end> 
<start>...I'll be quiet. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]............ 
<end> 
<start>...That's an option. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The leaders of each Reason are 
climbing the tower. 
<end> 
<start>The final battle for creation is about 
to begin. 
<end> 
<start>...With Futomimi gone, it doesn't 
matter to us which Reason wins. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Magatsuhi is flowing up toward 
Kagutsuchi. 
<end> 
<start>...Some of that consists of our 
people from Mifunashiro. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]With Baal's protection, 
Lady [12:FF04] was the first 
to start. 
<end> 
<start>She's not only noble, she's sharp! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Our god... Baal Avatar... 
<end> 
<start>I can't believe that 
Lady [12:FF04] was defeated... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]So, you are the true leader 
of Yosuga, defeating 
Lady [12:FF04]... 
<end> 
<start>We follow only the strong! Lead us 
well... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I heard the damn Manikins are 
climbing the tower. 
<end> 
<start>Those pests... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]............ 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You'll find out how superb we 
followers of Yosuga really are. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Now, let us fight alongside each 
other! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...I have no business with inferior 
beings, such as you. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...It can't be! 
<end> 
<start>How could Yosuga fall at the hands 
of an inferior being?! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Those damn angels, thinking they're 
all that! 
<end> 
<start>This is discrimination against 
ex-Mantra demons! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Those damn angels are all in 
a panic. Heheh. 
<end> 
<start>But yeah, I didn't think 
Lady [12:FF04] would be 
defeated... 
<end> 
<start>...Yosuga is finished. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]We, the believers of Shijima, will 
follow Commander Hikawa and 
conquer the tower. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]We shall see your works, 
Demi-fiend! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Infiltrator of our stillness, begone! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]............ 
<end> 
<start>Demi-fiend... A force to be reckoned 
with... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The Mantra's attack... The halt of 
the Nightmare System and the loss 
of the Maiden... 
<end> 
<start>We had a lot of fun, thanks to 
a certain 'somebody', but all is well. 
<end> 
<start>We have our god, Ahriman, to lead 
us to stillness. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Nooooo! Lord Hikawa! Ahriman...! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]According to our comrades, there's 
a bunch of traps on the floors 
above. 
<end> 
<start>Guess the path to Kagutsuchi isn't 
going to be an easy one, after all. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...Something's wrong! 
<end> 
<start>We have yet to receive word of 
Shijima's success in creation! 
<end> 
<start>It couldn't be...! 
<end> 
<start>............ 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]A mere girl on a power trip... 
A self-indulgent brat... They can't 
handle creation! 
<end> 
<start>...Oh, please excuse my behavior. 
<end> 
<start>I became quite emotional, contrary 
to the belief of Shijima. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...Our stillness...... has been 
disrupted...... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][12:FF03]'s already climbing 
the tower. 
<end> 
<start>Noah is incredible! We don't need to 
join together like those other 
Reasons. 
<end> 
<start>...We'll soon be able to create 
a world where we won't have to 
associate with anyone... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]No way!? 
<end> 
<start>Noah's... [12:FF03]'s... 
defeated!? 
<end> 
<start>Man, what's going to happen to our 
world of Musubi!? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...When I heard that [12:FF03] 
was beaten, I almost shit my pants. 
<end> 
<start>But, we have you, man! 
<end> 
<start>I don't care who it is, just as long as 
our world of Musubi is created... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]If you can reach the top, you should 
be able to meet Kagutsuchi. 
<end> 
<start>I hear it's a very long path, though... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...Well, you wouldn't be able to do it, 
so don't talk to me. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...Well, you should be able to do it. 
You have a strong sense of self. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Ah... Don't... Don't talk to me! 
<end> 
<start>Ever again! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]If the world of Musubi is created... 
<end> 
<start>...Nothing would really change. I'm 
doing what I want now, anyway. 
<end> 
<start>But, It would be nice if those 
annoying groups like Shijima and 
Yosuga disappeared. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Even if the world of Musubi can't be 
created... 
<end> 
<start>...I'll do whatever I want. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]......! ......! ......!! 
<end> 
<start>.........! ......! ...!! 
<end> 
<start>.........!? 
<end> 
<start>...What!? I'm listening to my music, 
can't ya tell!? 
<end> 
<start>There's no reason I need to go up 
just because the others did, right!? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]......! ......! ...!!... 
<end> 
<start>......! ...! ...! 
<end> 
<start>......! ...?  
<end> 
<start>...Huh?  
<end> 
<start>...Eh!? 
<end> 
<start>[12:FF03] was defeated!? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]When the other leaders are making 
their way up, why is Commander 
Hikawa not moving? 
<end> 
<start>...Is he waiting for the Demi-fiend? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The Demi-fiend... 
<end> 
<start>...That was an oversight. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The tower is filled with the power of 
Kagutsuchi... 
<end> 
<start>It's so strong, the higher levels 
aren't being formed properly. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I saw an incredible demon up ahead. 
It's big! It's red! 
<end> 
<start>...Is it still there? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You see the grave of Masakado. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Will you leave the area? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> There is a Mystical Chest. 
Will you open it? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> You did not open 
the Mystical Chest. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 
[2:FF05][3:FF01][2:FF01] x [3:FF02]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You see a Cache Cube. 
Will you open it? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> You did not open 
the Cache Cube. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It's empty. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 
[2:FF05][3:FF01][2:FF01] x [3:FF02]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 
the Magatama [2:FF05][3:FF01][2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 
[2:FF05][3:FF01] Macca[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It's a trap. 
<end> 
<start>> Your party took damage. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It's empty. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> [3:FF03] found something. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]............ 
> You obtained 
[2:FF05][3:FF01][2:FF01] x [3:FF02]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It can't be used here. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The light effect wore off. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The repel effect wore off. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The attract effect wore off. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The levitation effect wore off. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Select a floor. 
<end> 
<start>[3:FF01][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF02][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF03][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF04][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF05][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF06][80EA] 
<start>[7:FF07]Long ago, there was a hero who 
fought against the tides of time 
in pursuit of a better world. 
<end> 
<start>His name was Lord Masakado Taira. 
<end> 
<start>He's probably watching over us, 
even now... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF06]This is the Cathedral of Shadows... 
<end> 
<start>We hope that our secret art 
will be of help to you, 
master of demons. 
<end> 
<start>There are Cathedrals elsewhere; 
feel free to drop by. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF06]We have successfully developed 
a new fusion technique... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF06]...Do you know what a Demonic 
Compendium is? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF06]Let's call it... 
Sacrificial Fusion. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF06]Besides the two demons that are 
fused, an additional demon 
is sacrificed in the process. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF06]The strength of the resulting demon 
will reflect the level of the demon 
that was sacrificed. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF06]...Also, in some cases, you may 
end up with a completely different 
demon than you expected. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF06]I recommend that you experiment 
with various combinations. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF06]However, be forewarned that 
this type of fusion harnesses 
the chaotic power of Kagutsuchi. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF06]Therefore, it can only be performed 
when Kagutsuchi shines brightest. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF06]Why don't you give it a try 
next time? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF06]What an ominous thing you have... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF06]Deathstones are cursed stones 
that call upon death. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF06]A stone such as this can cast 
a shadow on my arcane art... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF06]Under certain circumstances, 
death will appear and warp 
the laws of fusion. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF06]When this occurs, a Fiend-- 
a bearer of death-- 
will manifest itself. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF06]Though they are not good, 
they cannot be classified as evil, 
either. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF06]In the end, it is you who will 
decide their nature. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF06]It contains information on 
all demons in existence, 
but only those that the reader has 
made a pact with can be viewed... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF06]I see that you have been recruiting 
many a demon. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF06]From now on, use this compendium 
to your advantage. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF06]> The Demonic Compendium is now 
available for use. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF06][12:FF01] [11:FF01]... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF06]At last, you have subjugated every 
species of demon in this land... 
<end> 
<start>How incredible your power is... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF06]In commemoration of 
this incredible feat, 
we wish to offer you a special 
rate for summoning demons. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF06]> The demon summoning fee 
has been reduced. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF06]I've been waiting for you, 
[12:FF01] [11:FF01]... 
<end> 
<start>In this land, there exist certain 
things that hold demonic power. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF06]...Yes, the Magatama in your body 
are what I am referring to. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF06]One who possesses 
a demon's strength, 
yet retains his humanity... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF06]We have long awaited 
such an individual. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF06]And then, along came you... 
<end> 
<start>You, a human with the strength 
of a demon, 
<end> 
<start>have succeeded in gathering 
all the Magatama. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF06]We have concluded that you are 
indeed worthy of a reward. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF06]> You obtained the [2:FF02]Lord's Sword[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF06]Take it to His Lordship. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF06]He, who once protected Tokyo, 
shall surely help you with 
his awesome might. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Oh my, a demon opened the way 
to Kagutsuchi. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]This is quite a surprise, 
isn't it, my little master...? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The tower thrust down 
by Kagutsuchi struck the Obelisk, 
driving it into the earth. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Those who yearn for creation 
will come streaming into this place. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You have done very well 
in keeping yourself alive 
and entertaining my little master. 
<end> 
<start>However, the final, most important 
act is about to begin. Don't let up. 
<end> 
<start>...So, my little master, 
do you think it's possible 
for a demon to steal the show 
at the performance's conclusion? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The child and the old woman 
disappeared... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]They are striving for creation. 
<end> 
<start>The time has come for you 
to choose... 
<end> 
<start>...between dedicating yourself to 
the purpose of creation, 
and living your life as a demon... 
<end> 
<start>If creation is your goal, 
then seek out Kagutsuchi. 
<end> 
<start>But, if you wish to live as a demon... 
<end> 
<start>I suggest that you go visit 
the old gentleman who lives deep 
in the red labyrinth. 
<end> 
<start>This is strictly my opinion, but... 
I see great potential in you. 
I think you would become a demon 
like no other. 
<end> 
<start>So, please be careful. 
<end> 
<start>Whether you live for creation 
or live as a demon, 
<end> 
<start>you will have no rest from 
this point on... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]So you have chosen to live as 
a demon... Your visit to 
the old gentleman has made you 
even stronger, I see. 
<end> 
<start>The only thing left for you to do 
is to vanquish Kagutsuchi and wait 
for the final battle... 
<end> 
<start>My little master says that when 
the time comes, he will go with you 
to the battleground. 
<end> 
<start>Until then, keep up the good work. 
<end> 
<start>My little master and I are 
looking forward to it... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF04]You win... 
Do as you... please... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Ha ha ha... 
I got beat up pretty bad. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I didn't expect [12:FF04] 
to be that strong... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I worked so hard to get 
the Reason of Musubi... 
But, it seems almost impossible 
for me to create my world now... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Here... Let me give you this. 
I have guarded it with my life... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained the [2:FF02]Netherstone[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...See ya, [12:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]It's... up to you now... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Congratulations, [12:FF01]. 
You've created the world of Yosuga. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]It's a strong and beautiful kingdom, 
for those who attain the height 
of power. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I always thought that I'd be the one 
to bring about the new world. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]...But, I guess instead my duty was 
to choose you. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I've completed my duty, so... 
I deserve a nice long rest, 
don't you think? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You're supposed to go that way. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]There you'll find eternal bliss... 
And it's rightfully yours. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Thanks for everything, 
[12:FF01]. 
Say hi to the world I dreamed of 
for me... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]A demon born in exchange for 
the world... 
<end> 
<start>There's no other quite like you. 
<end> 
<start>Kagutsuchi may have cursed you, 
but I give you my blessing. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF06]Light no longer shines upon you. 
<end> 
<start>But, you can do without it, 
can't you? 
<end> 
<start>Darkness is the source 
of your power now... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF06]I'm afraid I have to go now. 
<end> 
<start>I won't forget you, though. 
We'll definitely meet again... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF06]You should get going, too. 
<end> 
<start>Chaos will reign, as you desired, 
since no new world was forged. 
<end> 
<start>Indeed, it shall be the millennial 
kingdom of demons... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF06]I will go on to the next world. 
<end> 
<start>I won't forget about you, though. 
<end> 
<start>We'll meet again some day... 
<end> 
<start>Live on... 
<end> 
<start>...in this world of demons. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF06]You were such an extravagent toy. 
<end> 
<start>But, I'm not gonna play with you 
anymore. 
<end> 
<start>I'm going to the next world. 
<end> 
<start>You'll have to find a new friend 
to play with here, 
<end> 
<start>in this kingdom of demons 
and darkness... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]It was an entertaining show. 
I wasn't sure how it would turn out, 
but... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF06]You've become a demon... 
one that hungers for souls 
and can never be saved. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF06]So, go. Nothing was created, 
but you have achieved the eternal 
chaos you desired. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You have returned, mighty demon... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Have you not seen it 
with your own eyes...? 
<end> 
<start>The stronghold of Nihilo 
was laid to waste by my army... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Then, why...? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Behold... 
<end> 
<start>Magatsuhi escapes from my body, 
against my will... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]And I am not the only one! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]All the members of Mantra are being 
drained of their Magatsuhi...! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Curse you, Nihilo! 
<end> 
<start>...What sort of devious trick 
did they use!? 
<end> 
<start>Oh, the humiliation! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...No! I will not die! 
<end> 
<start>My body may perish, 
but my spirit will live on! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]In time, the one worthy 
of my power will come. 
<end> 
<start>It is then that I shall return!! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I will not let them create 
a world of stillness!! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]What good is a world without 
strength!? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I will not forget this rage, 
this fire that burns my flesh 
and soul! 
<end> 
<start>My kingdom shall rise again...!! 
<end> 
<start>...Gu...oh...... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I can see... 
<end> 
<start>...the Maiden... 
where the Magatsuhi is drawn to... 
<end> 
<start>But alas, 
we are utterly powerless... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]We have no choice but to wait 
for our doom... 
<end> 
<start>Woe to our leader! Gozu-Tennoh!! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF05]Well done. You've proven yourself 
with your awesome power. 
<start>[7:FF05]All of you who have lurked in 
darkness and waited faithfully 
for this day, hear me... 
<start>[7:FF05]A new demon of darkness has been 
born. 
<start>[7:FF05]...The time has come. 
<start>[7:FF05]Together, let us march onward! 
<start>[7:FF07]To the final battle... 
where our true enemy awaits! 
<start>[7:FF07]...You have created a new demon in 
your heart's likeness, fallen angel? 
<start>[7:FF07]Then, doom shall set us apart... 
<start>[7:FF07]now and forevermore... 
<start>[7:FF05][8184][80F7][8186] 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The headquarters of the Gaea cult... 
<end> 
<start>This is where it all started. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]They were a group who absorbed 
all forms of doctrine, 
for they believed they could discover 
the truth from chaos. 
<end> 
<start>But even within that cult, 
he was regarded as a heretic. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Yes, I am referring to the man 
who changed your destiny... 
and that of the world. 
<end> 
<start>He firmly believed that the ideal 
cannot be found in reality, 
<end> 
<start>that it could only be brought 
about by one's own hand. 
<end> 
<start>And ultimately, he reached beyond 
the scope of mankind and plotted 
the creation of the world. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Fate is drawn to a strong will, 
it seems. 
<end> 
<start>His plot became reality... 
<end> 
<start>...when he uncovered the Scripture 
of Miroku, buried deep within 
the cult's library. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]With the Scripture in his possession, 
he reconstructed the spinning drum 
of Amala. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]By deciphering the symbols on 
the drum, he gained access to 
the Amala Universe... 
<end> 
<start>and learned of the Conception... 
the fated destruction of the world. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...That incident at the park 
followed shortly thereafter. 
<end> 
<start>You see... 
For creation to be possible 
after the Conception, certain 
preparations were necessary. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The demons which he summoned 
were unleashed... 
<end> 
<start>...and a bloody act of carnage 
ensued. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]He decided to take control of 
the inevitable--the death and 
rebirth of the world. 
<end> 
<start>Some members of the Gaea cult 
were against him, 
and the Order of Messiah 
tried to stop him, but... 
<end> 
<start>...he eliminated both threats at once, 
with the power of his demons. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]With all opposition removed,  
he watched as the Conception 
took place, 
<end> 
<start>just as foretold in the prophecy 
of Miroku... No, just as he planned 
after unraveling the prophecy. 
<end> 
<start>The Assembly of Nihilo was created 
at that time as well, to aid him 
in creation. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]I see that you are making steady 
progress in recovering 
the candelabra. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]...By the way, did you not encounter 
a large number of souls in this 
realm? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]They are the memories of humans 
in your former world who were 
purified by death. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Even after drifting to the farthest 
reaches of Amala, they still cannot 
let go of the past. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Many of them were involved with 
a man that you have met... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]...a man by the name of Hikawa. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]He is the one who led your world 
to destruction. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]You stand here as the result of 
his acts in the former world. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]I commend you for making it 
this far. I wish to tell you 
something that you, as a human, 
would not otherwise have learned... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]...about his past, and what caused 
the Conception. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]That is what happened in Tokyo. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]The Conception occurred as he 
planned, and now creation will 
follow. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]However, the future is not set; 
we have yet to see what will happen. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]The world can be [2:FF02]set free from 
the perpetual cycle of creation[2:FF01]... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]We have faith in you, 
and will continue to watch you. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Exterminate all who interfere 
with his plan, 
<end> 
<start>and dispose of those who do not 
share his ideal... 
<end> 
<start>He decided to take control of 
the inevitable--the death and 
rebirth of the world. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Nevertheless, the direction of 
the new world is still undetermined. 
<end> 
<start>Will the world he envisions become 
reality, 
<end> 
<start>or will a different world be born? 
<end> 
<start>The answer to that question... 
The outcome... 
<end> 
<start>...may be decided by the actions 
you take from this point on. 
<end> 
<start>Be careful, and stray not from 
the path that you believe in... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...Are you the Fiend who has been 
seduced by the power of darkness? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Man is destined to die, 
and the world to end... 
Yet, still you challenge 
the order of the universe. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Do not lose sight of the truth, 
Demi-fiend. Your struggle against 
death is futile. 
<end> 
<start>No matter how many candelabra you 
gather, the shadow on your heart 
will not be lifted. 
<end> 
<start>It is my duty to save those 
who have gone astray... 
Let me be your guide. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Receive my salvation... 
Accept your death! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 
the [2:FF02]Candelabrum of Eternity[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Great, the entire park is closed. 
<end> 
<start>I won't be able to get a single 
picture of the scene... 
Just my luck. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]...What's up, kid? 
<end> 
<start>What happened here? 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Well, this is what they said on TV: 
<end> 
<start>[18:]"The clash between a well-known 
company and a civic organization 
results in deaths"... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]But, those who live on the fringe 
say... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]...that it was a struggle between 
two opposing cults. 
<end> 
<start>[18:][7:FF07]Oh... Okay. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]If you're not interested, then 
it's better not to get involved. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]You wouldn't believe me if 
I told you that there was a struggle 
between two religious cults... 
would you? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Your cell phone started to ring. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]...Huh? Isn't that your phone 
ringing? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...Hi, [12:FF01]? It's me. 
<end> 
<start>*sigh* I finally got a hold of you. 
What have you been doing all this 
time? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Please enter your classmate's 
name. 
[16:]<start><end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I could see if it was [12:FF03], 
but you're never late. 
Did something happen? 
<end> 
<start>Where are you now? Yoyogi Park? 
<end> 
<start>Well, since you didn't show up 
on time, [12:FF03] and I left 
without you. ...We're almost there. 
<end> 
<start>So yeah, I'm sorry, but can you 
come directly to the hospital? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You know which hospital it is? 
...Yeah, Shinjuku Medical Center. 
<end> 
<start>Just go east from Shinjuku Station, 
and you can't miss it. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Oh well. 
<end> 
<start>I wanted to talk to 
Ms. [11:FF02] about what 
I should do after graduation 
anyway. 
<end> 
<start>I'll be there ASAP. 
<start>[7:FF07]Thanks, I'm not planning on 
staying there long. 
<end> 
<start>Okay then, see you later. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...What? I care about my future, 
thank you very much. 
<end> 
<start>Honestly, you and [12:FF03] 
should start planning ahead too. 
<end> 
<start>...Anyway, don't keep us waiting, 
okay? 
<end> 
<start>See you later. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> [12:FF04] hung up. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Hey, wait a minute... You're going to 
Shinjuku Medical Center? 
<end> 
<start>...... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]...That's where I'm headed, too. 
What a coincidence. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Here, take this. 
This issue isn't out yet. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]You don't know what happened 
here, right? 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Then, you probably don't know what 
kind of place that hospital is, either. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]The report on the Gaea cult 
and the Scripture of Miroku... 
It's an interesting read. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]You wouldn't normally associate 
a hospital with the occult, but... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]That place is different. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]...Heheh. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]False info is pretty common in 
the occult industry. If it does 
turn out to be wrong, just laugh it 
off, okay? 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Well, I'd better get going. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]My name's Hijiri. 
If we ever meet again, let me know 
what you thought about my article. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained an issue of 
[2:FF02]Ayakashi Monthly[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Well, look who we have here... 
A weak-looking demon. 
<end> 
<start>Ah, whatever... Pixies, deal with him! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]*giggle* Look who's here! 
<end> 
<start>You're nothin' to us! 
<end> 
<start>We'll chase you outta here! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]And here I was wondering what kind 
of demon was trespassing... 
Why, you're only a harmless child! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You cannot pass through here 
by luck alone. 
<end> 
<start>I hope that you do not bore me. 
<end> 
<start>Pixies! Play with him! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Peace out, pervert! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You have done well coming this far. 
Though, I do not know if I should 
praise you or not. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]But, your luck ends here. 
How now, mad spirit! 
<end> 
<start>My troops shall entrap you as 
you move! 
<end> 
<start>This falls out better than I could 
devise! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Enjoy the waltz and pageantry 
the High Pixies of our kingdom are 
famed for... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Curse you! How have you made it 
past all of that unscathed? 
<end> 
<start>Rascals! You grow bolder with each 
with each passing day! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]But, you shall fall into despair 
this time... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I trashed the platform... 
Trashed! Har har har! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]And not just that... An entire legion 
of my best troops awaits you! 
<end> 
<start>And now, you will die... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]We destroyed the platform! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You can't see where we're hiding 
anymore! So, why don't you just 
give it up and leave? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I found you! I won't let you get 
any further! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You fell for it! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Get outta here! 
<start>[7:FF07]Go somewhere else! 
<start>[7:FF07]Get lost! 
<start>[7:FF07]Leave! 
<start>[7:FF07]Get outta here! 
<start>[7:FF07]Go somewhere else! 
<start>[7:FF07]Get lost! 
<start>[7:FF07]Leave! 
<start>[7:FF07]What a sneaky, little creep... 
He got past us! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Alright! This time, let's try 
the cross-formation! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Ugh! He passed again! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Okay, girls! X-formation! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Back me up! C'mon, c'mon! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]He's the one, huh? We just have to 
throw him out, right? Leave it to us! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]We all have to die sometime! 
I'm just trying to speed it up 
for you! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Hey, it's you! Long time no see! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Trying to get to the communications 
tower? My sisters are giving you 
a hard time, aren't they...? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Alright! I'll help you get through, 
nice and easy! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You know? 
<end> 
<start>Yes, I do. 
<start>[7:FF07]Sure you do. 
<end> 
<start>Then, I'll tell you... 
This was a communications tower 
construction site. 
<end> 
<start>It's divided into four sections. 
<end> 
<start>You can see this entire section from 
this platform. 
<end> 
<start>And those lights on the bridges are 
Pixies. 
<end> 
<start>Avoid Pixies at all costs. 
They'll just cause you trouble. 
<end> 
<start>So, it might be a good idea to scan 
the area to see where they're hiding. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I was watching the Pixies, 
and I noticed something... 
<end> 
<start>It seems that they have 
two "formations" when hiding. 
<end> 
<start>From here, one formation looks 
like an X. 
<end> 
<start>And the other one looks like 
a cross. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Yay!! We're finally here! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I guess this is goodbye? 
<end> 
<start>Good riddance. 
<start>[7:FF07]Whoa! Talk about harsh! 
<end> 
<start>You sure you can get by 
without me? 
<end> 
<start>Heck, yeah. 
<start>[7:FF07]Is that so! Then, here you go. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained the Magatama 
[2:FF03]Ankh[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Careful not to die out there! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Awww! I knew you wanted to be 
with me. 
<end> 
<start>Alrighty! I guess I'll stay with you 
a little longer! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]We made it to Yoyogi Park, so 
I guess we can part ways now. 
<end> 
<start>Or... do I get the sense you want us 
to stay together? Hmmm??? 
<end> 
<start>I need you. 
<start>[7:FF07]Mmmm... I like the way that sounds. 
*flirt* 
<end> 
<start>You win! I'll stay with you 
a while longer! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]What a friggin' jerk you turned out 
to be! 
<end> 
<start>Take this, then. Think of it as 
payment. At least I'm not an asshole 
like you! *pfffft* 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You'd better take good care of it! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The door's locked... Is it the work of 
my friends inside? 
<end> 
<start>If you want to get into 
the construction site, there's 
an entrance on the Harajuku side. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> There is someone by the bench... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Did you know? 
<end> 
<start>A [2:FF02]human girl[2:FF01] is at 
the Mantra's headquarters now. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Yes, I know, my little master. 
<end> 
<start>I believe it was the same young lady 
who was at the hospital. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I wonder if she's thinking about 
coming up with a Reason. 
<end> 
<start>I'm really interested. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I am too, my little master. 
<end> 
<start>Ikebukuro will be bustling with 
action once again. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The child and the old woman 
disappeared... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> No one is here... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The platform has been destroyed. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Huh...? What was I doing...? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]*yawn* I had a weird dream... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]In my dream, I was a bad demon, 
hee ho! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]No, it was not a dream. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]It was all Sakahagi's doing. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]We had been cursed by Sakahagi 
and were reduced to our primitive 
nature. 
<end> 
<start>[13:FF01], 
I ask you to forgive our 
discourtesy... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You may take the Yahirono 
Himorogi as you please. 
It is a sign of our gratitude. 
<end> 
<start>By the way... 
<end> 
<start>Before we were cursed, a human girl 
came here. 
<end> 
<start>She was beaten by Sakahagi, yet 
somehow survived and limped to 
safety, but... 
<end> 
<start>I felt an evil power from her heart. 
Something even stronger than that 
of Sakahagi. 
<end> 
<start>That girl is not an ordinary human... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...Oh, excuse me. That was 
completely irrelevant. 
<end> 
<start>We shall take our leave. We all 
thank you from the bottom of 
our hearts. 
<end> 
<start>Please put the Yahirono Himorogi 
to good use... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]We won't ever forget you! 
<end> 
<start>Bye-bye! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The fairies disappeared... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The flames of the [2:FF02]Candelabrum 
of Sovereignty[2:FF01] are flickering wildly... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You can feel the presence of 
a terrifying demon... 
<end> 
<start>> Will you stay here? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> Are you sure? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF02]> ............ 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It looks like you'll be able to 
get away. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It looks like you won't be able to 
escape... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I know you have a Candelabrum! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The flames of the Candelabrum 
burn passionately! 
You won't escape! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Will you leave the area? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> There is a Mystical Chest. 
Will you open it? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> You did not open 
the Mystical Chest. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 
[2:FF05][3:FF01][2:FF01] x [3:FF02]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You see a Cache Cube. 
Will you open it? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> You did not open 
the Cache Cube. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It's empty. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 
[2:FF05][3:FF01][2:FF01] x [3:FF02]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 
the Magatama [2:FF05][3:FF01][2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 
[2:FF05][3:FF01] Macca[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It's a trap. 
<end> 
<start>> Your party took damage. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It's empty. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> [3:FF03] found something. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]............ 
> You obtained 
[2:FF05][3:FF01][2:FF01] x [3:FF02]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It can't be used here. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The light effect wore off. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The repel effect wore off. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The attract effect wore off. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The levitation effect wore off. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Select a floor. 
<end> 
<start>[3:FF01][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF02][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF03][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF04][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF05][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF06][80EA] 
<start>[7:FF07]> The door is locked from 
the other side. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The door is locked. 
<end> 
<start>> Will you unlock it? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> The door is now unlocked. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I've seen that communications 
tower before... 
<end> 
<start>The name [2:FF02]Hikawa[2:FF01] comes up when 
I look at it... 
<end> 
<start>...I feel like something bad happened 
to me... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]That woman seems like she's up to 
something! 
<end> 
<start>...She's probably a monster here to 
eat us! 
<end> 
<start>That's another bad thing that's 
gonna happen to me... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]............ 
<end> 
<start>...I heard an incredible woman 
appeared at Ikebukuro! 
<end> 
<start>Now something bad IS gonna 
happen to me! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The Lady of the Fount's hot... 
You met her yet? 
<end> 
<start>Oh, yeah. 
<start>[7:FF07]...Man, she's hot! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Then, hurry up and go to 
the Fountain of Life up ahead. 
<end> 
<start>...She's hot! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The Lady of the Fount is hot as 
usual! You visiting? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You know... She's so hot! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Then, how've you been recovering!? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]............ 
<end> 
<start>The hot one's always been 
the Lady of the Fount... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I'm telling ya, 
the Lady of the Fount's 
the hottest of them all! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The construction site over there is 
now the home of the fairies. 
<end> 
<start>They locked the door, so we can't 
get in... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]But, I wonder if you can get in from 
the east side? 
<end> 
<start>You should be able to get there by 
taking the [2:FF02]Asakusa Tunnel[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>Good thing Tokyo's circular. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...That's what I was going to say, 
but you came from inside! 
<end> 
<start>So, what's in there? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The construction site's pretty quiet 
now. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I heard there's a beautiful woman 
somewhere around this side of 
the park. 
<end> 
<start>...I prefer the cute little Pixies, 
though. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You know about that [2:FF02]human girl[2:FF01] in 
Shibuya? 
<end> 
<start>Seems that she came from some 
hospital. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I heard that they were doing some 
pretty cruel things at Shinjuku 
Medical Center. 
<end> 
<start>Gaea cult, was it? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I...... 
<end> 
<start>............ 
<end> 
<start>...Prefer [12:FF02]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The door is locked. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You used the [2:FF02]key to Yoyogi Park[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> You sense strong power 
from beyond the door. 
<end> 
<start>> Will you enter? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]Why are the fairies occupying 
the construction site anyway? 
<end> 
<start>Is there a large amount of Magatsuhi 
stashed there or something...? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The fairies may have locked 
themselves in because they don't 
like this harsh world. 
<end> 
<start>But even then, they got dragged into 
the war over Magatsuhi... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Be careful, the fairies have all 
gone crazy. 
<end> 
<start>If you get too close to one without 
thinking, you'll be teleported 
somewhere else! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Man, I'm so glad that the Pixies are 
back to normal. 
<end> 
<start>I was teleported everywhere! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You can see that communications 
tower being built by the crane, 
right? 
<end> 
<start>That's where that Sakahagi is. 
<end> 
<start>But, you can't get into that section 
from here. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Sakahagi, huh...? 
That was one creepy guy. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]There was a treasure chest 
containing loads of Magatsuhi 
under the communications tower. 
<end> 
<start>Sakahagi used that to summon 
a powerful demon. 
<end> 
<start>...It reflects physical attacks. 
<end> 
<start>*sigh* How did it come to this? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]*sigh* Is there no god in this world? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]A vicious-looking Manikin walked 
into the construction site. 
<end> 
<start>He locked the door, so the fairies 
that were outside are in a panic. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The fairies are back to normal. 
<end> 
<start>Those that were locked out went 
back inside. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Oh no, oh no! 
<end> 
<start>Everyone went crazy! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Dang... 
<end> 
<start>That Sakahagi messed everyone up 
and slipped right inside... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]What's up with this Sakahagi!? 
<end> 
<start>Is that human in the southern room 
in cahoots, too!? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]This construction site is split into 
four sections. 
<end> 
<start>There's a platform in each one, so 
try climbing it. 
<end> 
<start>You can see from there the entire 
section and the shining Pixies that's 
trying to hide. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]There's no more Pixies hiding, 
but climb up once in awhile. 
It feels good. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Huh? 
<end> 
<start>The High Pixies changed positions? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I saw you do your thing from 
up here. 
<end> 
<start>You're good. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Those High Pixies... They change 
their positions every time you pass 
under them. 
<end> 
<start>There's a cross-formation and 
an X-formation. 
<end> 
<start>Try checking them out from 
a platform. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Well, it is a bit lonely not having 
those High Pixies buzzing around. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]There! He's in there! 
<end> 
<start>That Manikin Sakahagi went into 
the communications tower site! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]That was cool... 
<end> 
<start>After you went inside, the sky lit 
right up. It was like magic! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I heard that there's a babe 
somewhere around here. 
Oh where, oh where can she be? 
<end> 
<start>...Heard she looks nice from behind, 
if you catch my drift! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]............ 
<end> 
<start>The babe with a nice behind 
had the face of death! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Lately, a lady's been seen around 
these parts. 
<end> 
<start>I've only seen her from behind, 
but what I saw looks good! 
<end> 
<start>If you wanna meet her, try looking 
for her. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Cerberus was erased. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Are you trying to get to Ikebukuro, 
too? 
<end> 
<start>I say you should turn back. 
<end> 
<start>There's a crazy dog blocking 
the way up ahead. He's a real 
ruffian! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Hey! Did you see that giant dog? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]That dog... Maybe it's guarding 
the Mantra... Or, maybe it just likes 
hounding people. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]If you rover on up ahead, you'll see 
him. Be careful not to get eaten. 
He's a doggone menace! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]GRRRRRRRRR......... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> There is a ferocious dog blocking 
the path! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The Mantra are collecting Magatsuhi 
while using Ikebukuro as their 
headquarters. 
<end> 
<start>I saw a bunch of Manikins being 
taken there. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Eep!! D-D-D-Don't kill me! 
<end> 
<start>Oh, sorry... Wrong demon. 
<end> 
<start>I was just attacked by the Mantra. 
Aside from the usual brutality, 
they used very harsh language! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Stability created by regulations, or 
chaos resulting from freedom... 
<end> 
<start>Which is the better world...? 
That's a difficult choice... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]My, what a handsome boy! 
I can give you a massage! 
<end> 
<start>Okay. 
<start>[7:FF07]Mmmm... You're pretty tense... 
Ahhh... How's this...? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You fully recovered! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Oh, that's too bad. 
<end> 
<start>If you'd like a relaxing massage, 
talk to me anytime! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Hey, do you like this underpass? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]Are you stupid? 
I hate this place!! 
<end> 
<start>There's nothing to drink 
down here but dirty water!! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You, too? Ew! They need to do 
something about this dirty water. 
<end> 
<start>I'm all thirsty, and there's 
nothing down here.  
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]What is it? 
<end> 
<start>Give her clean water. 
<start>[7:FF07]You're giving this to me??? 
Thank you sooo much!! 
<end> 
<start>I'll give you this in return! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The main character obtained 
1 rare item. 
<end> 
<start>Don't talk to me if you've got 
nothing to say! Speaking makes 
me even thirstier! *cough* 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Take good care of my treasure! 
It's 'precious' to me! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The flames of the [2:FF02]Candelabrum 
of Sovereignty[2:FF01] are flickering wildly... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You can feel the presence of 
a terrifying demon... 
[16:]<start><end> 
<start>The flames of the candelabrum 
beckon me to the battlefield! 
<end> 
<start>I do not know who you are, but... 
If you have a candelabrum, 
it is our destiny to fight. 
<end> 
<start>Let us duel to the death within 
my realm, where no one can 
interrupt us! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...So, those holding candelabra did 
attract each other... 
<end> 
<start>[12:FF01], I have a favor to 
ask of you. 
<end> 
<start>There is no hurry, but could you 
bring your candelabrum to us? 
<end> 
<start>I will allow you access to 
the [2:FF02]Labyrinth of Amala[2:FF01] from 
the terminal. 
<end> 
<start>I will explain the details 
once you arrive. 
<end> 
<start>Until then, please make sure 
you do not lose the candelabrum... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You hear a familiar voice. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You can no longer hear 
the lady's voice. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You used the terminal and 
headed to the Labyrinth of Amala... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Great timing! I have something to 
ask you... 
<end> 
<start>Of those two forces that are 
waging war right now--Nihilo and 
the Mantra... 
<end> 
<start>Which side are you on? 
<end> 
<start>Mighty Mantra's side. 
<start>[7:FF07]The Mantra's city of Ikebukuro is 
a place ruled by violence. 
<end> 
<start>You can't complain if you are 
maimed. No one complains if you 
kill someone. 
<end> 
<start>I see that you have the stomach to 
endure that rule. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...You are against rule by power? 
Do you not have confidence in your 
own power? How odd... 
<end> 
<start>...Allow me to judge your power!! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I am amazed by *pant* your power... 
I must *pant* train harder... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]......Ah!! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]......Whoa!! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]......Ack!! He's this far already!? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]A demon...? Is he a [2:FF02]Mantra[2:FF01] demon? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...Huh!? Mantra!? 
<end> 
<start>Ummmmmm...... 
<end> 
<start>Anyway, let's report this to 
everyone! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]......Ahhh!! H-He's here...! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...Th-The demon's here! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...Th-The Mantra!? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]............ 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]A Mantra demon... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]......It's over...... 
<end> 
<start>...It's all over... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]............ 
<end> 
<start>............ 
<end> 
<start>............? 
<end> 
<start>......Huh? 
<end> 
<start>............ 
<end> 
<start>Hey, he's not a Mantra! Never seen 
a demon of the likes of him in 
their army! 
<end> 
<start>...I was worried for nothing. Now, 
I can get back to my rocking chair. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]............ 
<end> 
<start>...What? 
<end> 
<start>Are we that peculiar to you? 
<end> 
<start>Actually, yeah. 
<start>[7:FF07]We're [2:FF02]Manikins[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>You can probably tell a lot about us 
just by seeing where we live. 
<end> 
<start>...Now, go home! Everyone else, do 
the same. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]............ 
<end> 
<start>I thought that you'd never seen 
a [2:FF02]Manikin[2:FF01] before. 
<end> 
<start>That was a waste of time... 
Everyone, back to business! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Oh...... 
<end> 
<start>I guess he's not a Mantra demon... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...We were worried for nothing. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]From the moment us Manikins are 
born, we're destined to become 
slaves. 
<end> 
<start>...Even now, many of our people are 
suffering at the hands of the Mantra. 
<end> 
<start>But, we have a heart too, y'know! 
We can feel pain like anyone else. 
<end> 
<start>Being a slave is miserable... 
That's why we escaped to this 
underpass... 
<end> 
<start>We live in a constant state of fear 
that the Mantra will attack us at any 
moment... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]That's why we've sealed off the path 
up ahead. 
<end> 
<start>I'm sorry, but we can't open 
the gate to Ikebukuro. 
<end> 
<start>Please go back... 
<end> 
<start>Now, then... We must return to our 
duties. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The Manikins returned to 
their rooms. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Hey! Stop right there. 
<end> 
<start>This path leads to Ikebukuro, 
the base of the Mantra. 
<end> 
<start>It would be real bad if the Mantra 
came, so I can't open the gate. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I can't let you pass. 
<end> 
<start>It wouldn't be good if the Mantra 
came, so I can't open the gate. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]How many times do I have to tell 
you? I can't let you pass... 
<end> 
<start>............. 
<end> 
<start>...What's this? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You gave the gatekeeper 
the [2:FF02]Manikin's Letter[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...? A letter from him? 
<end> 
<start>............ 
<end> 
<start>............? 
<end> 
<start>............! 
<end> 
<start>............ 
<end> 
<start>...I got it. If that's the case, 
it can't be helped. 
<end> 
<start>...Go ahead and pass. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Ask me anytime if you want to get 
through. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...Going through? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]............ 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...Open the gate? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]............ 
<end> 
<start>...Hey. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Are you that demon everyone is 
talking about? 
<end> 
<start>I'm a collector of many things, 
especially things that have to do 
with humans. 
<end> 
<start>So, I leave the underpass every 
so often, convincing the gatekeeper 
to let me through. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Well, if you need some advice, 
I'll help you. 
<end> 
<start>...Maybe you could help me collect 
'stuff'... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Is something wrong? 
<end> 
<start>............ 
<end> 
<start>...The gatekeeper is preventing you 
from passing by to get to Ikebukuro, 
huh? 
<end> 
<start>Would you like me to persuade him 
to let you through? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]Are you sure? Okay, suit yourself. 
<end> 
<start>I doubt you'll be able to get that 
gatekeeper to let you through. 
<end> 
<start>Come back if you change your mind. 
I'll be here. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Alright, I'll persuade the gatekeeper 
to let you through. 
<end> 
<start>But, only on one condition... 
<end> 
<start>You have to find something that I'm 
looking for. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I want a [2:FF02]Bill[2:FF01]. It's a small portrait 
painted by humans in a greenish 
color. 
<end> 
<start>It's small, yet detailed, and it 
uses watermarking technology that 
changes patterns... 
<end> 
<start>It had value at one time, I think. 
I heard that some humans valued it 
more than their lives! 
<end> 
<start>I'd like to find one, but I have 
no clue as to where I can find it. 
<end> 
<start>I heard that there were plenty 
where [2:FF02]people crowded together[2:FF01]. 
...A city, perhaps? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Maybe you'll be able to do it. 
You're a demon, after all. 
<end> 
<start>Anyways... I entrust you with finding 
that Bill. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]*gasp* A real BILL!!! 
<end> 
<start>We had a deal, right? C'mon, c'mon! 
Oh, this is great!!! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You handed over the [2:FF02]Bill[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]As I said, a deal's a deal. 
Hold on a sec. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...Here you go. Give this [2:FF02]letter[2:FF01] to 
the gatekeeper. This should get you 
through. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained the [2:FF02]Manikin's letter[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]See you later... I hope you get to 
Ikebukuro safely. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Ooooooh... It says '1000' on it!! 
Wonder what that's worth...? 
<end> 
<start>Hmmm... Where's the switch to 
activate the watermark? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Did you find a Bill?  
<end> 
<start>I heard that there were plenty 
where [2:FF02]people crowded together[2:FF01]. 
...A city, perhaps? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The Mantra are busy attacking 
Nihilo, so now's a great chance to 
collect stuff around Ikebukuro! 
<end> 
<start>To go, or not to go... 
That is the question! 
I'd hate to get killed... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> No one is here. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You feel like 
the story progressed. 
<end> 
<start>A [2:FF05]flag[2:FF01] seems to 
have been raised. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> This is a spare NPC. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The flame of 
the [2:FF02]Candelabrum of Sovereignty[2:FF01] 
is wavering wildly... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You can feel the presence  
of a terrifying demon... 
<end> 
<start>> Will you stay here? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> Are you sure? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF02]> ............ 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It looks like you'll 
be able to get away. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It looks like you 
won't be able to escape. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I know that 
you have a candelabrum! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The flames of the candelabrum 
burn passionately! 
You won't escape! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Will you leave the area? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> There is a Mystical Chest. 
Will you open it? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> You did not open 
the Mystical Chest. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 
[2:FF05][3:FF01][2:FF01] x [3:FF02]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You see a Cache Cube. 
Will you open it? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> You did not open 
the Cache Cube. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It's empty. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 
[2:FF05][3:FF01][2:FF01] x [3:FF02]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 
the Magatama [2:FF05][3:FF01][2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 
[2:FF05][3:FF01] Macca[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It's a trap. 
<end> 
<start>> Your party took damage. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It's empty. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> [3:FF03] found something. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]............ 
> You obtained 
[2:FF05][3:FF01][2:FF01] x [3:FF02]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It can't be used here. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The light effect wore off. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The repel effect wore off. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The attract effect wore off. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The levitation effect wore off. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Select a floor. 
<end> 
<start>[3:FF01][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF02][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF03][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF04][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF05][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF06][80EA] 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]...Oh, you again. 
<end> 
<start>Is it bothering you that much? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]............ 
<end> 
<start>...We're Manikins. 
<end> 
<start>Our destiny is to be slaves to 
the demons. 
<end> 
<start>...But, we can also feel pain, 
you know. 
<end> 
<start>That's why we live in hiding 
in this underpass. 
<end> 
<start>...Get it? So, please leave us be. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...Then, leave us be. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]We're like humans, but we're not... 
<end> 
<start>We were made to look like them, for 
some reason or another. It can't be 
helped. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Eeeeeeeeep! D-D-D-Don't kill me! 
<end> 
<start>............ 
<end> 
<start>Oops... Wrong demon. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I-I-I-I thought I was going to be 
killed! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I've decided to stay here. 
I've grown attached to this 
place. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]This underpass is built like a maze, 
so it's perfect for a hideout. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You! You know [2:FF02]Gozu-Tennoh[2:FF01]? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...You're cool. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You blow. 
<end> 
<start>Gozu-Tennoh is the leader of 
the Mantra! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The Mantra and the Assembly of 
Nihilo oppose each other because 
their ideals differ. 
<end> 
<start>They have different ideas of how 
Tokyo should be run, you see. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Did you meet the Manikin who 
collects junk? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You did? 
<end> 
<start>He's weird... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...I see. 
<end> 
<start>He likes things that humans used. 
If you want to meet him, he's 
downstairs. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Many of our fellow Manikins are 
suffering in Ikebukuro as slaves of 
the [2:FF02]Mantra[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>...Um, the Mantra are a group of 
demons based in Ikebukuro. Dunno 
if you knew... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The Mantra are headed for Nihilo's 
headquarters in Ginza. 
<end> 
<start>They used this underpass to get 
there, so we all locked ourselves 
inside of our rooms. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Everyone headed to Asakusa, where 
Futomimi is. 
<end> 
<start>This place has become desolate 
now. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I prefer this underpass. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Ikebukuro is west of here. 
<end> 
<start>If you're going back to Ginza, 
head east. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]If the Mantra and Nihilo ever go 
at it... 
<end> 
<start>This place'll be toast in no time. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The Mantra and Nihilo have finally 
started it! Inquiring minds want to 
know... 
<end> 
<start>Will the Mantra win with power, or 
will Nihilo win with strategy? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The Assembly of Nihilo... 
They're quite a dangerous bunch... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Hitting on me in a place like this?! 
<end> 
<start>Well, demons with a gift for gab 
have skills that calm opponents 
down when they get upset. 
<end> 
<start>A smooth talker like that would be 
popular with the ladies! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]This is the Great Underpass of 
Ginza that connects Ginza to 
Ikebukuro. 
<end> 
<start>...It's a loooooong tunnel full of 
full of poisonous demons! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The terminal up ahead is 
an [2:FF02]S terminal[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>You can use it to return to 
the parent terminal. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Are you headed to Ikebukuro? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...I see. It's probably for 
the best. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Ikebukuro's right there after 
you get out of this hall. 
<end> 
<start>But, there hasn't been a single 
being that's escaped the Mantra's 
clutches once they've been caught! 
<end> 
<start>...Gozu-Tennoh isn't a pushover. 
You'd better be careful. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]A bunch of Mantra demons came 
through here on their way to fight 
Nihilo. 
<end> 
<start>Phew!! I'm sooooo glad they didn't 
spot me! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Shijima... 
<end> 
<start>The commander of Nihilo is 
planning to create a world 
based on the Reason of Shijima. 
<end> 
<start>I think I like the idea... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The door is closed tight. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The g-g-g-grim reaper! 
<end> 
<start>Up ahead! Up ahead! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]............ 
<end> 
<start>...Is the reaper still there? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The atmosphere around you has 
changed. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The atmosphere around you has 
reverted back to normal. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Halt! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I am the guardian of this building. 
<end> 
<start>Thou shalt not pass this area. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...By my sword of flames, thy body 
shall be reduced to ashes! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You made it this far without dying... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I praise you. I haven't had such 
fun hunt in quite a while. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...But, I cannot let you go any 
further. 
<end> 
<start>The Magatsuhi in this building is 
already ours. 
<end> 
<start>All we have to do now is summon 
our god, and we will receive 
the Reason of Shijima! 
<end> 
<start>I will not allow you to meddle with 
our commander. 
<end> 
<start>I, Mada, will personally hand you 
a ticket to hell! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It's a painting of a hallway. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It's a painting of a door. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It's a trick painting. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It's a trick painting. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You entered the painting. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Mot's magic is coming undone. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You can hear a voice... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You fell for my trap! 
<end> 
<start>Dumbass! Get outta here! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Hahahaha! Dumbass! 
<end> 
<start>My traps are everywhere! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You can hear a voice... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Thou hast fallen prey to mine art! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Thou hast fallen prey to mine art! 
<start>[7:FF07]> You can hear a voice... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]With my power, thy path hath been 
closed! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You can hear a voice... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]With my power, thy path hath been 
closed! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You can hear a voice... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...Truth and falsity are but light and 
darkness. 
<end> 
<start>Dost thou have the capacity to find 
my true self? 
<end> 
<start>Thou shan't escape from this 
labyrinth, lest thou seest the truth...! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Fool! 
<end> 
<start>The truth lies not there! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Curse thee... 
<end> 
<start>Curse thee, knave...! 
<end> 
<start>I shall smite thee down myself! 
<end> 
<start>Our world of Shijima draws nigh! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]............ 
<end> 
<start>> It's just a statue. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It's a statue. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The statue disappeared. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You took damage. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You can hear a voice... 
<end> 
<start>With my power, thy path hath been 
closed! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> No one is here. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]debug 
<end> 
<start>blah 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]O Demi-fiend...... Thou hast set foot 
into my chamber of judgement. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I am the arbiter who enforces 
the law known as the Prophecy of 
Miroku. 
<end> 
<start>[12:FF01], I shall hereby 
prosecute thee! 
<end> 
<start>Just as the prophecy says, Reasons 
are appearing and this Vortex World 
is nearing the time of creation. 
<end> 
<start>A new world shall be created, no 
matter which Reason prevails... 
'Tis a joyous occasion! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]But, darest thou, a demon, attempt 
to create the new world? 
<end> 
<start>It is forbidden! Demons shan't 
create the world! 
<end> 
<start>[12:FF01]! It is my duty to ask 
thee questions to test thine 
alignment. 
<end> 
<start>[12:FF01], dost thou accept 
that thou art a demon? 
<end> 
<start>Of course I'm a demon. 
<start>[7:FF07]Then [12:FF01], dost thou 
accept that thy heart is demonic? 
<end> 
<start>Demon to the bone. 
<start>[7:FF07]Finally, allow me to ask thee, 
demon. 
<end> 
<start>Dost thou swear not to take part in 
the creation? 
<end> 
<start>I wouldn't dream of it. 
<start>[7:FF07]Good, now look at me-- 
<end> 
<start>What's this!? Such a vexing light in 
thine eyes! 
<end> 
<start>Thou hast hatred toward the world! 
'Tis true! Thou art the bane of 
creation! 
<end> 
<start>Infidel! This cannot be forgiven! 
I shall stamp thee out of existence! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]'Tis true that thou art the bane of 
creation... 
<end> 
<start>Infidel! This cannot be forgiven! 
I shall stamp thee out of existence! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]O Kagutsuchi... Hath the destroyer 
appeared...? Or is he...? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You can hear a voice. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...O lost one. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I warn thee, leave this place at once. 
<end> 
<start>This edifice of Magatsuhi is in 
Nihilo's possession... 
<end> 
<start>Our god shall soon descend upon 
us, and we shall acquire our 
Reason. 
<end> 
<start>Leavest not, and thy life shall be 
the price. 
<end> 
<start>Begone, lost sheep...! 
<end> 
<start>............ 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You cannot hear the voice anymore. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Hmmm... He beat Surt... That kid's 
not bad. 
<end> 
<start>Looks like this might turn out to be 
interesting after all... 
<end> 
<start>I think I'll play around with him! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Curses...! 
<end> 
<start>Not only Surt, but Mada as well... 
<end> 
<start>...Be it so, he shan't travel far! 
<end> 
<start>With my magic, he shall forever 
wander these halls! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Will you leave the area? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> There is a Mystical Chest. 
Will you open it? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> You did not open 
the Mystical Chest. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 
[2:FF05][3:FF01][2:FF01] x [3:FF02]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You see a Cache Cube. 
Will you open it? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> You did not open 
the Cache Cube. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It's empty. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 
[2:FF05][3:FF01][2:FF01] x [3:FF02]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 
the Magatama [2:FF05][3:FF01][2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 
[2:FF05][3:FF01] Macca[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It's a trap. 
<end> 
<start>> Your party took damage. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It's empty. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> [3:FF03] found something. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]............ 
> You obtained 
[2:FF05][3:FF01][2:FF01] x [3:FF02]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It can't be used here. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The light effect wore off. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The repel effect wore off. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The attract effect wore off. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The levitation effect wore off. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Select a floor. 
<end> 
<start>[3:FF01][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF02][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF03][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF04][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF05][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF06][80EA] 
<start>[7:FF07]> The door is locked from 
the other side. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The door is locked. 
<end> 
<start>> Will you unlock the door? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> You unlocked the door. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You sense a strong power 
from beyond the door. 
<end> 
<start>> Will you enter? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The door is closed tight. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]............ 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> There is a statue. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Commander Hikawa is on the top 
floor, summoning his god. 
<end> 
<start>Finally... Finally, the Reason of 
Shijima will be conceived! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The Reason of Shijima has finally 
been conceived... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]What's going on!? 
<end> 
<start>The Nihilo demons suddenly arrived, 
and now the halls are all messed 
up! 
<end> 
<start>...It's okay to go this way, right? 
It's not a picture, is it...? 
<end> 
<start>The Nihilo are nothing but a bunch 
of rude demons! How dare they play 
around with me! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]We're still okay if Hikawa conceives 
his Reason, right? ...Right??? 
<end> 
<start>Oh, what to do...? Yosuga? 
Maybe Musubi? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You see that elevator over there? 
<end> 
<start>Hikawa... and another woman took 
that to the top. 
<end> 
<start>...W-What kind of world is Hikawa 
planning to create? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...W-What kind of world is Hikawa 
planning to create? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The truth. 
<end> 
<start>If you don't have the eyes to tell 
the truth from the lies, you'll be 
tricked over and over. 
<end> 
<start>Beyond the truth waits the demon 
in charge of this place. 
<end> 
<start>That's why I pick the lies... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]............ 
<end> 
<start>I guess I'm... saved. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I-I-I'll give you that treasure! 
<end> 
<start>So, please don't eat me! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Yosuga and Musubi have already 
begun the final steps toward 
creation. 
<end> 
<start>But, there is nothing to worry 
about. 
<end> 
<start>We will soon receive our Reason of 
Shijima. 
<end> 
<start>The moment is near... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Yosuga... Musubi... and Shijima... 
Which will prevail? 
<end> 
<start>The moment of decision is near... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Hey, let me out of here! 
<end> 
<start>I'll be free if the demon here is 
defeated, so someone beat him! 
<end> 
<start>I don't care if only one type of 
attack works! Just try everything, 
dammit! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...Geez, that Hikawa is nothing but 
trouble! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You see the grave of Masakado. 
<end> 
<start>Make it so [2:FF02]you have all the hearts[2:FF01]. 
<start>[7:FF07]> The [2:FF02]Lord's Blade[2:FF01] began to 
shine! 
<end> 
<start>> You are surrounded by a bright 
light... 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> Will you leave the area? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> There is a Mystical Chest. 
Will you open it? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> You did not open 
the Mystical Chest. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 
[2:FF05][3:FF01][2:FF01] x [3:FF02]. 
<end>

Will you open it? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> You did not open

the Magatama [2:FF05][3:FF01][2:FF01].

<start>[3:FF02][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF03][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF04][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF05][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF06][80EA] 
<start>[7:FF07]Long ago, there was a hero who 
fought against the tides of time 
in pursuit of a better world. 
<end> 
<start>His name was Lord Masakado Taira. 
<end> 
<start>He's probably watching over us, 
even now... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...This is the Fountain of Life, 
where the wounded find refuge... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF06]Welcome to the Fountain of Life... 
<end> 
<start>Your name has reached 
my humble ears... 
I will assist you to the best 
of my ability. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF06]Welcome to the Fountain of Life... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF06]I know your story, and I know that 
within you lies a tremendous 
power... 
<end> 
<start>Please allow me to release 
whatever power I may. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF06]> [13:FF01]'s stats increased. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF06]Oh... There is still power inside 
you which has yet to be set free. 
<end> 
<start>I will try to release it. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF06]All of the power that lay dormant 
inside you has now been unleashed. 
<end> 
<start>Though I know not what you have 
endured, it is your past 
experiences which are the source 
of your untapped power. 
<end> 
<start>I hope your new found strength 
serves you well... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Kagutsuchi lost its light... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]by the hand of a demon. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]The world will never be born again. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Creation is no longer possible. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Be born, 
<end> 
<start>[18:]grow, 
<end> 
<start>[18:]die, 
<end> 
<start>[18:]...and be born again 
<end> 
<start>[18:]That was the way of the world. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]One demon has changed that. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]A world is created, 
<end> 
<start>[18:]populated by mankind, 
<end> 
<start>[18:]and destroyed... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]This cycle is what maintains 
the flow of time; when the cycle 
stops, so does time. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]And now, time has met her death. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]In place of the creation of 
the new world, 
<end> 
<start>[18:]a new power of darkness emerged... 
reigning over chaos, 
heaping death upon death. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]You must no longer have 
any notion... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]of where your strength will lead you. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]The Great Will shall curse you 
for going against his way, 
<end> 
<start>[18:]and place a heavy burden of 
atonement on your shoulders, 
which you shall bear for all 
eternity. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Fear not, 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]for only by receiving that curse 
can you truly walk the path of 
conquest. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]But first, I must know the extent 
of the power of darkness you hold 
within. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Behold the supreme power of 
darkness, created by none other 
than the Great Will himself... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]I see that you have braved 
the Labyrinth of Amala and 
returned several candelabra. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]I am confident that you will recover 
the remaining candelabra too. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]You must be cautious, though. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]The Fiends that stole the candelabra 
are unique and powerful demons. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]...Now that I think about it, 
<end> 
<start>[18:]this all started because of one man 
who caused the Conception in 
the previous world. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]The Conception... Because of it, 
the Vortex World was born. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Kagutsuchi... the source of light 
and power for this world... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]You who once lived as a human 
must be wandering this world 
without any understanding. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]To show you my appreciation for 
returning the candelabra, 
<end> 
<start>[18:]I would like to share with you 
my knowledge on the Vortex World 
and Kagutsuchi. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Kagutsuchi... It is the light 
whose sole purpose is to empower 
the one who will oversee creation. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Creation is the act of bringing 
a new world into existence, 
made possible by the annihilation 
of the old world. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Kagutsuchi will allow a life form 
of its choosing to determine 
the course of the new world. 
<end> 
<start>There must be those in Tokyo who 
yearn to be chosen by Kagutsuchi, 
in order to realize their vision. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The shape of the world to come 
depends on who is chosen... 
<end> 
<start>...and what their Reason is. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]In the vast Amala Universe, 
this Vortex World is not the only 
place where creation occurs. 
<end> 
<start>Kagutsuchi rises, matures, 
and falls in countless other places. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]There are millions--no, billions 
of worlds that you are unaware of, 
and they all experience the cycle 
of death and rebirth. 
<end> 
<start>That is the way of Amala, 
as determined by the Great Will. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]With my master, I have watched how 
myriads of worlds came into being, 
how life prospered in those worlds, 
<end> 
<start>and how they were destroyed 
in the end... 
<end> 
<start>...all that time, seeking the answer 
to the unanswerable question, 
"Why is a world reborn?" 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]But now... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]We may be on the verge of finding 
the answer... 
<end> 
<start>...and it is your actions which hold 
the key. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Please retrieve the remaining 
candelabra as soon as possible, 
and then come see my master. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]My master has high hopes for you. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]The fallen angel has bestowed upon 
you great strength. Do not lose your 
life and let this gift be in vain. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:][12:FF01]! You did it! 
<end> 
<start>[18:]I could tell from here 
that the flow of Magatsuhi 
had returned to normal. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Well, with this blow to Nihilo, 
Hikawa won't be able to make 
his move for a while. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]I think we can take 
a little breather. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]But, how did you stop 
the Nightmare System? 
Wasn't that Maiden operating it? 
<end> 
<start>I saved her. 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]So, Hikawa was using her, huh? 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Who knows what she'll do now, 
but at least the Nightmare System 
is dead. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]I see... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]She might have been one of 
the few surviving humans, 
but I guess you had no choice... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Oh, you're not gonna tell me? 
<end> 
<start>[18:]...Does it bother you that much? 
<end> 
<start>[18:]If so, then I'll stop asking. 
I'm satisfied knowing that 
the Nightmare System is out of 
commission. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Oh yeah. It might seem like 
I'm making you do all the work, 
but... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]...I'm doing what I can. 
Let me share with you what 
I've found out so far, okay? 
<end> 
<start>Sure. 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Alright, listen up. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Come on, man. 
Journalism is pointless 
without an audience. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]I don't care if you're interested 
or not, just listen. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]To create a new world, you must 
have a strong idea of what kind 
of world you want to create. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]This idea is commonly referred to 
as a Reason. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Now, to acquire a Reason, 
you must receive divine protection 
from a god, 
<end> 
<start>[18:]and this is where the Magatsuhi 
comes into play. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]You need a large quantity 
of Magatsuhi in order to 
summon a god. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]That's why Hikawa, a human, 
was collecting Magatsuhi. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Oh, I almost forgot. 
I met a human inside the Amala 
Network just a minute ago. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]It was a guy who was held 
captive by the Mantra. 
His name's [12:FF03]. 
Do you know him? 
<end> 
<start>Yes, I know him. 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Yeah, that's what I thought. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Really? 
<end> 
<start>[18:]There was a rumor that you were 
trying to help him, but... Oh well. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Anyways, about [12:FF03]... 
He actually seemed to be 
doing okay in Amala. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]If you're unlucky, 
you can get swept away somewhere, 
or even worse, you can end up 
being absorbed by the network. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Well, in a world like this... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]one life doesn't amount to much, 
and you're better off 
not getting involved. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]But if you want, 
I can send you to where 
I met [12:FF03]. 
<end> 
<start>[2:FF02]Dummy event for checking; 
terminal menu will be displayed 
in the actual game.[2:FF01] 
<end> 
<start>Will you have Hijiri send you 
to where [12:FF03] is? 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]No problem. 
...I'll start right away. 
<end> 
<start>[2:FF02]Too bad, not gonna happen. 
It ends right here cuz it's 
a dummy event.[2:FF01] 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Let me know if you change 
your mind. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Do you want me to transfer you 
to where [12:FF03] is? 
<end> 
<start>Yeah, can you? 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]No problem. 
<end> 
<start>Just give me a second ... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]...Okay, I'm ready. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Here we go. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]By the way, tell [12:FF03] 
not to spend too much time 
in there. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Just let me know when you're ready. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]It was a little confusing, 
wasn't it? No big deal. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]To create a new world, you must 
have a strong idea of what kind 
of world you want to create. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]This idea is commonly referred to 
as a Reason. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Now, to acquire a Reason, 
you must receive divine protection 
from a god, 
<end> 
<start>[18:]and this is where the Magatsuhi 
comes into play. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]You need a large quantity 
of Magatsuhi in order to 
summon a god. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]That's why Hikawa, a human, 
was collecting Magatsuhi. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]...Well, there you go. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Haha! We meet again, 
[13:FF01]! 
<end> 
<start>It is the will of the candelabra... 
<end> 
<start>Longing for but a single owner, 
they call out to each other and 
bring us together! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]If you can defeat all the Fiends 
and reunite the candelabra, 
then so you should! 
<end> 
<start>But, if you lack the strength 
to do so... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]then you will fall by my arrow! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07](dead phrase) 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> [13:FF01] obtained 
the [2:FF02]Candelabrum of Compassion[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][12:FF01], 
you finally made it. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You know, this hospital... 
It's a little strange. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...There's nobody here. 
Not a single person. 
<end> 
<start>Look, even the reception desk 
is empty. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][12:FF03] is looking for 
Ms. [11:FF02] right now. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]He hasn't come back yet, though. 
He'd better not be off fooling 
around. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Isn't it creepy here? 
I don't like it... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][80EA] 
<end> 
<start>[18:][7:FF07]...Hey, what's that magazine? 
<end> 
<start>Some guy gave it to me. 
<start>[18:][7:FF07]You got it from a stranger? 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Come on, you should know better 
than that. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Knowing your taste, 
it probably wouldn't interest me. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Ayakashi Monthly... 
I've never heard of it before. 
<end> 
<start>[18:][7:FF07]What!? It's an occult magazine! 
Why would you bring something 
like THAT here!? 
<end> 
<start>...... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]...Well, I guess it might help me 
kill some time. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:][12:FF01], can you go 
look for [12:FF03]? 
<end> 
<start>[18:]If we can't find Ms. [11:FF02], 
then I don't wanna stay here 
another minute. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]He should be on the second floor, 
where the patients' rooms are. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]I'll wait here. 
...Oh yeah, let me borrow 
this magazine. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Thanks! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> [12:FF04] left... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> A ceremony is being prepared. 
It seems fishy... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> A ceremony is about to start. 
It seems very fishy indeed... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You have no business here. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Dammit! Dammit! Dammit! 
<end> 
<start>Screw everyone for making fun of 
us just because we're Manikins! 
<end> 
<start>We're gonna summon a magnificent 
demon, then give 'em the beating of 
their lives! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Right on! It's payback time! 
<end> 
<start>Hurry up and summon that 
magnificent demon! 
<end> 
<start>Summon the magnificent [2:FF02]Mara[2:FF01]! 
This is going to be sooo sweet!! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]............ 
<end> 
<start>*chuckle* As I haaaad been saying, 
it's not time yet. 
<end> 
<start>Mara is a magnificent demon... 
<end> 
<start>If we summon him at the wrong 
time, something baaaad may 
happen. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Quit your stallin'! 
<end> 
<start>We can't let anyone who's made fun 
of us live any longer than they 
absolutely have to! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]That's right, Mr. Baphomet. 
Just like the guy on the right said! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You there! You tell him, too! 
<end> 
<start>Tell him to summon Mara and 
make our lives a little easier! 
<end> 
<start>Hurry it up. 
<start>[7:FF07]*chuckle* The demon boy is right. 
We shouldn't daaaash into things! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Hey! Don't tell him that! 
Get outta here! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Ah! You're back! 
<end> 
<start>Are you here to tell him to hurry up 
and summon Mara??? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]See?! He thinks so too! 
<end> 
<start>Now, hurry up and summon Mara! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]............ 
<end> 
<start>*chuckle* 
<end> 
<start>Have it your way! Not my fault if 
something baaaad happens, okay? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Baphomet begins to chant... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF04]Awaken, o mighty one... 
Hear my words... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF04]Come forth from the depths of 
shadow... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF04]And submit to my will! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF04]............ 
<end> 
<start>............ 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]........................ 
<end> 
<start>...Ugh......G-g-geee...... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]*chuckle* 
<end> 
<start>Well! In my rush, I have summoned 
Mara the Magnificent in an 
incomplete body of a slime. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! 
Run away!!!! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...Blarg......Blug...... 
......Yo...u...... 
<end> 
<start>......Blah...B-Bluh...... 
H...ow.........Blorg...... 
<end> 
<start>......How...dare...you...! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Baphomet and the Manikins 
ran away. 
<end> 
<start>> Something is on the ground... 
<end> 
<start>> You obtained the Magatama 
[2:FF03]Muspell[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Hey, wait a sec! 
<end> 
<start>You promised to take me to 
Yoyogi Park! 
<end> 
<start>This is Shibuya! S-H-I-B-U-Y-A!! 
Let's turn around. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Hey! 
<end> 
<start>Don't bug me when I'm dancing! 
Don't you know a dancing queen 
when you see one!? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I hear that the demons are burning 
with passion for the creation... 
<end> 
<start>But... I'm burning with passion for 
dancing! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I heard some guys were trying to 
have a ceremony every time that 
weird Kagutsuchi's full. 
<end> 
<start>They kept saying, "We'll summon 
a magnificent demon." 
Sounds... fishy. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Who're you? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You again? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]What!? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]............ 
<end> 
<start>Do you know about the [2:FF02]ultimate 
Magatama[2:FF01]? 
<end> 
<start>I'm totally outta the closet, so 
I'm into all kinds of jewels. 
<end> 
<start>The man at the Cathedral of 
Shadows is hiding something... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Kagutsuchi's burning... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You know what [2:FF02]Mystical Chests[2:FF01] are? 
<end> 
<start>They have some pretty good stuff 
in them! 
<end> 
<start>But, if you're unlucky, the contents 
will change. 
<end> 
<start>...I wonder if there's a way to get 
the good stuff all the time... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I hear that there's an item that'll 
never run out no matter how many 
times you use it... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]There's a temple to the north of 
Ueno that's sealed up, 
<end> 
<start>and I heard that Bishamon is 
the one responsible for it. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]There's a human involved with 
the organization in Ginza. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]It seems that the Mantra's in trouble. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]It's dangerous to go to 
the Cathedral of Shadows when 
you're cursed. 
<end> 
<start>Darkness has an effect on things. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I heard there's a demon calling 
himself the 'Emperor' at Kabukicho. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You can overhear the souls' 
conversation... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]There's an organization in [2:FF02]Ginza[2:FF01] 
saying that it'll "create a new world". 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Huh?  
"Create a new world"?? 
I'm scared! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The girl you were talking to looked 
pretty depressed... I wonder if she's 
okay. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I hear it's good to fuse Mitama with 
demons! 
<end> 
<start>That's what the guy at Rag's said. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I heard there's something merciless 
going down at Minafushiro. 
<end> 
<start>Seems that a human girl's involved. 
Could it be the one you talked to 
way back then? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]......! ......! 
<end> 
<start>......! ...! ...! 
<end> 
<start>......! ...!!! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The DJ is totally into it. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...! ...! ...! ...! 
<end> 
<start>...!! ......!! 
<end> 
<start>...!!!!!!!! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The DJ is going full blast. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The flames of the [2:FF02]Candelabrum 
of Sovereignty[2:FF01] are flickering wildly... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You can feel the presence of 
a terrifying demon... 
<end> 
<start>> Will you stay here? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> Are you sure? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF02]> ............ 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It looks like you'll be able to 
get away. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It looks like you won't be able to 
escape... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I know you have a candelabrum! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The flames of the candelabrum 
are burning passionately! 
You won't escape! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Will you leave the area? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> There is a Mystical Chest. 
Will you open it? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> You did not open 
the Mystical Chest. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 
[2:FF05][3:FF01][2:FF01] x [3:FF02]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You see a Cache Cube. 
Will you open it? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> You did not open 
the Cache Cube. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It's empty. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 
[2:FF05][3:FF01][2:FF01] x [3:FF02]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 
the Magatama [2:FF05][3:FF01][2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 
[2:FF05][3:FF01] Macca[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It's a trap. 
<end> 
<start>> Your party took damage. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It's empty. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> [3:FF03] found something. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]............ 
> You obtained 
[2:FF05][3:FF01][2:FF01] x [3:FF02]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It can't be used here. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The light effect wore off. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The repel effect wore off. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The attract effect wore off. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The levitation effect wore off. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Select a floor. 
<end> 
<start>[3:FF01][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF02][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF03][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF04][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF05][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF06][80EA] 
<start>[7:FF07]There are two underground plazas 
in this city. 
<end> 
<start>There's one with shops, and one 
with a club. 
<end> 
<start>For shops, I recommend 
the [2:FF02]Cathedral of Shadows[2:FF01]. 
They have creepy ceremonies there. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The tower coming from Kagutsuchi 
made a direct hit on the Obelisk! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]This is Shibuya, the city of the free. 
<end> 
<start>The other cities battle it out 
because of disagreements, but 
everyone here's laid-back. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Kagutsuchi, huh? Amazing. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You can hear sounds coming 
from inside the room. 
<end> 
<start>> Will you enter? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]The only currency in this world is 
[2:FF02]Macca[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>Demons and shady stores may ask 
for gems, but it all comes down to 
Macca. 
<end> 
<start>You can buy anything with Macca! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]There's bad stuff going down in  
other cities... 
<end> 
<start>At the very least, I'd like to have 
some leisure time to enjoy 
shopping! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Hey, have you heard? 
<end> 
<start>In [2:FF02]Ginza[2:FF01], there's a group saying that 
they'll make a new world. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]If you wanna know what's going on 
in Tokyo, check out the [2:FF02]club[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>Head down there if you want 
the latest scoop! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Information is perishable. 
<end> 
<start>Make sure you don't let any slip by 
you at the club or the lounge in 
Ginza. 
<end> 
<start>The trick is to visit often. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Yo, homey! 
<end> 
<start>The club's up ahead. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Hey! 
<end> 
<start>What were ya talkin' about with 
that human? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I know the name of the organization 
in Ginza, meow! 
<end> 
<start>Meow! I have an idea! If you do 
something naughty with me, I'll tell 
you the name! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Will you do something naughty with 
with Nekomata? 
<end> 
<start>Sounds purrrfect. 
<start>[7:FF07]Meow, wonderful! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Rrreow! You scaredy-cat! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Meow! Meow! That was terrific! 
Now, I need to keep my end of 
the bargain. 
<end> 
<start>I believe the name is... 
the [2:FF02]Assembly of Nihilo[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The organization in Ginza is called 
the [2:FF02]Assembly of Nihilo[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Hey, you. 
<end> 
<start>You livin' out your devil life to 
the fullest? How 'bout a drink? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Will you drink a glass of 
'Megido Spirits'? 
<end> 
<start>Bottoms up. 
<start>[7:FF07]Tsk, tsk, tsk. 
Still a kid... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> ............!! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Not bad, man. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Hey, you. 
<end> 
<start>You livin' out your devil life to 
the fullest? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]We demons tend to wage wars with 
each other for Magatsuhi. 
<end> 
<start>That goes double when our 
principles differ. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Magatsuhi has the power to grant 
any wish you want! 
<end> 
<start>Like, "I wanna be stronger," or 
"I wanna be popular". Well, it grants 
most wishes... 
<end> 
<start>Anyway, everyone wants it. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I hear the organization in Ginza has 
a very clever leader. 
<end> 
<start>Plus... he's a human! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Demons eat us to gain Magatsuhi. 
<end> 
<start>I can't stand that! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]He's late... 
<end> 
<start>Where's that Forneus!? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]He's still not here... 
<end> 
<start>Hey, you over there! 
Have you seen Forneus??? 
<end> 
<start>I saw him alright. 
<start>[7:FF07]Liar... 
<end> 
<start>It was stupid to even ask you. 
<end> 
<start>Now, where's that Forneus...? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]............ 
<end> 
<start>Well, of course a dork like YOU 
wouldn't know. 
<end> 
<start>Now, where's that Forneus...? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Something's wrong... 
<end> 
<start>Could it be...? Might someone have 
bumped off Forneus? 
<end> 
<start>Hey, you over there! Do you know if 
Forneus is okay? 
<end> 
<start>I know. 
<start>[7:FF07]...What!? 
<end> 
<start>............ 
<end> 
<start>............ 
<end> 
<start>Suuuuuure! A wimpy little nerd 
like you beating him up... 
<end> 
<start>Now! Where's that Forneus...? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]............ 
<end> 
<start>The tower stretched out from 
Kagutsuchi... 
<end> 
<start>The time has finally come for one 
Reason to be chosen to carry out 
the creation. 
<end> 
<start>...And Forneus never did come. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Hey... You talkin' to me? 
<end> 
<start>Yeah, I think I am. 
<start>[7:FF07]Better not be. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Welcome to Kick-Ass Deli, punk! 
Try my knuckle sandwich!! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]............ 
<end> 
<start>I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry! 
<end> 
<start>I'll offer you some juicy information, 
so please forgive me... 
<end> 
<start>There's a human girl at the club 
downstairs. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]............ 
<end> 
<start>Let me call you Boss! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You're going to the Tower of 
Kagutsuchi, Boss? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Come on, you're so modest! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Well, you'll be at the top in no time, 
Boss. 
<end> 
<start>Come on, you even beat me! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]What's going on here? 
<end> 
<start>First it was a human girl, and now 
it's a new demon. What next!? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Ugh... 
<end> 
<start>I was almost eaten by a demon at 
the club... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Ew!!! 
<end> 
<start>You're a demon, too! Go eat 
something else for your snack! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You've got some tight tats! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You're gonna climb the Tower of 
Kagutsuchi? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Well, make the world a fun one! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]So, those tatoos are just there to 
make you look tough? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]A [2:FF02]human male[2:FF01] suddenly appeared at 
the terminal. 
<end> 
<start>He's still snooping around there 
yelling, "I've got it!" every so often. 
What's he got? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]WE DEMONS ARE AFFECTED BY 
KAGUTSUCHI. 
<end> 
<start>WHEN IT'S FULL, WE BECOME 
AGITATED AND CANNOT SPEAK 
WELL. 
<end> 
<start>WE ALSO BECOME AGGRESSIVE 
AND PREVENT ENEMIES FROM 
ESCAPING. 
<end> 
<start>IT'S DANGEROUS WHEN 
KAGUTSUCHI IS BRIGHTEST. 
REMEMBER THAT... OR ELSE. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Teenagers these days... They've got 
strange names for just about 
everything... 
<end> 
<start>Take that dance hall, for example. 
What do they call it?  A club? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> They seem to be busy. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]There's a human involved with 
the organization in Ginza. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You can overhear the souls' 
conversation... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]In [2:FF02]Ginza[2:FF01], there's a group saying that 
they'll make a new world. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Create a new world? Sounds scary! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Hey! 
<end> 
<start>Don't bother me when I'm dancing! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Who're you? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]......! ......! 
<end> 
<start>......! ...! ...! 
<end> 
<start>......! ...!!! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The DJ is totally into it. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...! ...! ...! ...! 
<end> 
<start>...!! ......!! 
<end> 
<start>...!!!!!!!! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The DJ is going full blast. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You know what [2:FF02]Mystical Chests[2:FF01] are? 
<end> 
<start>They have some pretty good stuff 
in them! 
<end> 
<start>But, if you're unlucky, the contents 
will change. 
<end> 
<start>...I wonder if there's a way to get 
the good stuff all the time... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The tall building up ahead is 
the [2:FF02]headquarters[2:FF01] of the Mantra. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You shouldn't go near it. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Being a demon must be hard. 
<end> 
<start>Living and dying must be hard, 
too... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]It was a breach of 
the weapons prohibition. 
<end> 
<start>It was a foreigner. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Hey, you! Yeah, you! ...I've never 
seen you before! 
<end> 
<start>Are you here knowing that this is 
[2:FF02]Ikebukuro[2:FF01], home of the Mantra? 
<end> 
<start>Of course I did. 
<start>[7:FF07]Whoa! You've got some balls! 
<end> 
<start>But, that just ain't gonna cut it! 
<end> 
<start>Guts don't mean shit if you ain't got 
the power to back it up! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Then, get outta here! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...You again!? 
<end> 
<start>You wanna piece of me?! 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]Then, get lost! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The demons suddenly attacked! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Power is everything! 
<end> 
<start>You need to be able to handle 
everything on your own. Don't you 
agree? 
<end> 
<start>Absolutely. 
<start>[7:FF07]You know your shit, buddy!! 
<end> 
<start>You look weak, but you'd make 
a great addition to the Mantra 
with that kinda attitude! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Power is everything! 
<end> 
<start>Don't forget that. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]WHAT???? 
<end> 
<start>If you weren't a demon, I'd squeeze 
the Magatsuhi outta you!! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Power is everything! 
<end> 
<start>You need to be able to handle 
everything on your own. 
Remember that! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Make up your mind... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Everyone went to attack Nihilo. 
<end> 
<start>But, there's still a strong demon 
in the [2:FF02]east wing[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>Was there a demon this strong 
in our army...? 
<end> 
<start>If you have some time, check and 
see who it is. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The demon with the strong aura 
seems to have disappeared! 
<end> 
<start>I'm still wonderin' who the hell 
he was. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]What the hell's happening? 
It's pretty damn loud over at 
our headquarters. 
<end> 
<start>...We didn't lose, did we? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...I can't believe it. 
Gozu-Tennoh's... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I hear Kabukicho's done for... 
<end> 
<start>That's what the Manikins told me 
before leaving. 
<end> 
<start>...Well, I'll do what I want. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Our old headquarters' been bustling 
with activity lately. 
<end> 
<start>A human guy was here, too. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Our new leader is [12:FF04]! 
<end> 
<start>She's inherited Gozu-Tennoh's 
power. 
<end> 
<start>...It's time to rock! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Ha! 
<end> 
<start>You lucked out, fool. I can't believe 
Thor approved your release... 
<end> 
<start>Now, get lost! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...Oh, yeah. 
<end> 
<start>Thor says that you've proved 
your strength. 
<end> 
<start>You're free to enter our 
headquarters anytime. 
<end> 
<start>That really pisses me off! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The flames of the [2:FF02]Candelabrum 
of Sovereignty[2:FF01] are flickering wildly... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You can feel the presence of 
a terrifying demon... 
<end> 
<start>> Will you stay here? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> Are you sure? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF02]> ............ 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It looks like you'll be able to 
get away. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It looks like you won't be able to 
escape... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I know you have a candelabrum! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The flames of the candelabrum 
burn passionately! 
You won't escape! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Will you leave the area? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> There is a Mystical Chest. 
Will you open it? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> You did not open 
the Mystical Chest. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 
[2:FF05][3:FF01][2:FF01] x [3:FF02]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You see a Cache Cube. 
Will you open it? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> You did not open 
the Cache Cube. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It's empty. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 
[2:FF05][3:FF01][2:FF01] x [3:FF02]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 
the Magatama [2:FF05][3:FF01][2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 
[2:FF05][3:FF01] Macca[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It's a trap. 
<end> 
<start>> Your party took damage. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It's empty. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> [3:FF03] found something. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]............ 
> You obtained 
[2:FF05][3:FF01][2:FF01] x [3:FF02]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It can't be used here. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The light effect wore off. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The repel effect wore off. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The attract effect wore off. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The levitation effect wore off. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Select a floor. 
<end> 
<start>[3:FF01][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF02][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF03][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF04][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF05][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF06][80EA] 
<start>[7:FF07]> Will you enter 
the Mantra's headquarters? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> You can hear a voice 
coming from inside... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...What the hell?! 
<end> 
<start>I didn't do anything... 
<end> 
<start>............ 
<end> 
<start>............ 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You cannot hear the voice 
anymore. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Hey, you! Yeah, you! ...I've never 
seen you before! 
<end> 
<start>Are you here knowing that this is 
[2:FF02]Ikebukuro[2:FF01], home of the Mantra? 
<end> 
<start>Of course I did. 
<start>[7:FF07]Whoa! You've got some balls! 
<end> 
<start>But, that just ain't gonna cut it! 
<end> 
<start>Guts don't mean shit, if you ain't got 
the power to back it up! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Then, get outta here! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...You again!? 
<end> 
<start>You wanna piece of me?! 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]Then, get lost! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]We are the strong! What's wrong 
with enslaving weak Manikins!? 
<end> 
<start>Hyahahahahaha! Might makes right! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]It's finally time for war! 
<end> 
<start>Hyahahahahaha! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I heard Gozu-Tennoh's screwed! 
<end> 
<start>Dammit! I'm screwed too! 
<end> 
<start>The Manikins won't turn against me, 
will they!? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]We're oppressed! We're worked to 
death! 
<end> 
<start>Woe is me! Life's too short... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Um, are we being oppressed? 
<end> 
<start>Something seems different... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]We're being oppressed, so please 
save Futomimi. 
<end> 
<start>Then, our oppression will end. 
...I think. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You can enter the headquarters 
from here in the main hall. 
<end> 
<start>But, if you get too close, you'll be 
arrested. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]It's noisy for some reason... 
Are the Mantra going down? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]If you feel like it, save Futomimi. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The Mantra squeeze Magatsuhi from 
us! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]At Kabukicho Prison, they squeeze 
every last ounce of Magatsuhi out of 
us Manikins. 
<end> 
<start>The prophet Futomimi is there. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]NiHIlo iS bAd! NIHiLo IS tRaSH! 
<end> 
<start>...I eAT thEM aLL! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]FIenDs aRe baD! FiEnds ARe trASH! 
<end> 
<start>...CaN I eAt thEm aLL? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The Nihilo demons are... 
<end> 
<start>They're just whimpering dogs! 
<end> 
<start>Those pathetic puppets! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The demons called Fiends... 
<end> 
<start>They hang around looking tough, 
but... 
<end> 
<start>...They scare me! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Gozu-Tennoh gave us demons 
power! 
<end> 
<start>And he's got lots of it, that's for 
sure. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Hey... You're that demon that won 
the trial! 
<end> 
<start>Then, you must've gotten power 
from Gozu-Tennoh, huh? 
<end> 
<start>Isn't that power the shits? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Yeah, huh...? 
<end> 
<start>Then go attack Nihilo to show off 
your new power! 
<end> 
<start>The other demons already left. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]It's not? 
<end> 
<start>...Well, don't sweat it. 
<end> 
<start>The other demons went to attack 
the Assembly of Nihilo. 
<end> 
<start>You go do the same and relieve 
some of that stress! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]No one's coming back... 
<end> 
<start>............ 
<end> 
<start>Are the Mantra... 
Is Gozu-Tennoh's rule over...? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Soon, a new leader will be born... 
<end> 
<start>Heheheh... I'm glad I stayed here. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Yosuga, huh...? 
<end> 
<start>Not bad... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I saw a human boy enter 
the Mantra's headquarters. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I heard that a human boy is 
locked away somewhere in 
the headquarters. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I heard that everyone locked away 
in the Mantra's headquarters 
escaped. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...Another oppression begins. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The Mantra is run by 
Gozu-Tennoh's right-hand man, 
named [2:FF02]Thor[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>Thanks to him, the Mantra finally 
look like an organization. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]It's all over for the Mantra. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Did you know? 
<end> 
<start>There's a rumor going around that 
Gozu-Tennoh's regaining strength. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]In the world of Yosuga, only 
the chosen can survive... 
<end> 
<start>Uh-oh... I'll be picked, right? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The Mantra are real different from 
the demons of Nihilo. 
<end> 
<start>They're a group of ruffians that have 
nothing but brawn. 
<end> 
<start>Their boss is Gozu-Tennoh. 
He's in the headquarters. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Gozu-Tennoh lost, I heard. 
<end> 
<start>Because of that, the guards at 
Kabukicho Prison are running wild. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I hear that the Manikin prophet has 
escaped from Kabukicho. 
<end> 
<start>They say he's going to make a new 
city. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]It's going to become busy again... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I've come here to join the Mantra, 
so that I can become just like 
the great King, hee ho! 
<end> 
<start>............ 
<end> 
<start>But, I'm too scared to go in, hee ho! 
The fire's hot, too... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The Mantra demons rampage about, 
doing whatever their instincts tell 
them to. 
<end> 
<start>I'm jealous. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]A man in red was looking around 
here for someone. 
<end> 
<start>He was looking for a demon named 
[2:FF02][13:FF01][2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>...Do you know anything? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You're pretty... stylish. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Hey, boy... 
<end> 
<start>We're not as easy as Nihilo, so you 
better watch your back! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...We got ourselves a sucker. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Let's take everything he gots. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...Huh? 
<end> 
<start>Whatcha talkin' to me for? 
You want the Magatsuhi beaten 
outta ya? 
<end> 
<start>...Crap. You're a demon. 
<end> 
<start>Can't get Magatsuhi from demons. 
You lucked out, punk!! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The Mantra have a facility for 
draining Magatsuhi from Manikins. 
<end> 
<start>A lot of my friends are being drained 
right now. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Futomimi is a prophet. He guides us 
with his prophecies. 
<end> 
<start>So, let's hurry up and save them. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]............ 
<end> 
<start>They get angry at me if I'm talking, 
so please don't talk to me! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]There used to be these [2:FF02]four Oni[2:FF01] 
in the Mantra. 
<end> 
<start>But, they made Thor angry and were 
kicked out. 
<end> 
<start>I hear they've become thieves! 
Those four were real strong. 
...Ever heard of them? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]If Yosuga was to create the world... 
<end> 
<start>...I'd be the first to go. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Did you come here from 
the Great Underpass? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]Ah... 
<end> 
<start>Is the hideout still okay? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]............ 
<end> 
<start>...How'd you get here, then? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I help the junk-collecting Manikin 
a lot. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Soon, Gozu-Tennoh will order us to 
attack the Assembly of Nihilo. 
<end> 
<start>...I can't wait! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Argh, why did it have to be me!? 
Anyone else could be guard! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]What, we lost!? 
<end> 
<start>...I'm outta here! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I messed up and got caught. 
They dragged me out of the Great 
Underpass. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Now that the Mantra demons are 
gone, this place feels like home. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The Mantra demons are gone, 
but the Yosuga demons are now 
here... 
<end> 
<start>...It still feels like home, though. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The door is closed tight. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I only win Life Stones with 
the junk shop's [2:FF02]Lucky Tickets[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>I don't need stupid Life Stones, 
I want that! You know, that! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Geez! I still haven't won it! 
<end> 
<start>I only win stupid Life Stones with 
the junk shop's [2:FF02]Lucky Tickets[2:FF01]! 
<end> 
<start>"Unlucky Tickets" is more like it! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I hear that Nihilo has a demon that 
gains experience without ever 
fighting. 
<end> 
<start>That's some skill those Nihilo 
demons have. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]There's a demon with a skill that 
allows it to gain experience without 
fighting. 
<end> 
<start>You know anything about it? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]What a filthy city... 
<end> 
<start>When Yosuga takes over the world, 
cleaning the city should be 
top priority... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The creation of the world of Yosuga 
is at hand. 
<end> 
<start>There is nothing to worry about... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]There's a [2:FF02]strange monk[2:FF01] hanging 
around the east branch. 
<end> 
<start>Is he preparing a late service for 
all the Manikins? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Hey, what's going on with this city!? 
<end> 
<start>First that conceited jerk, and now 
an [2:FF02]eerie Fiend[2:FF01]! 
<end> 
<start>What's going on!? Something's up! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Go home! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Yurakucho Station. 
<end> 
<start>> The entrance is closed tight. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Everything from here on is under 
the Assembly of Nihilo's direct 
control! 
<end> 
<start>I can't let a suspicious demon, 
like you, through here! 
<end> 
<start>So, get outta here, right now! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]It's dangerous 'round these parts! 
<end> 
<start>There're nothin' but strong demons 
from here on out. And I mean, 
strong demons!! 
<end> 
<start>They'll mop the floor with a weak 
demon, like you... 
<end> 
<start>And I mean, mop the floor!! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I know you!  
<end> 
<start>You're that kid who fought it out 
with the Nihilo, right? 
<end> 
<start>That's incredible!! A runt, like you, 
beating them!! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The Assembly of Nihilo. 
<end> 
<start>> The door is tightly locked. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The Assembly of Nihilo. 
Second Entrance. 
<end> 
<start>> The door is tightly locked. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Will you leave the area? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> There is a Mystical Chest. 
Will you open it? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> You did not open 
the Mystical Chest. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 
[2:FF05][3:FF01][2:FF01] x [3:FF02]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You see a Cache Cube. 
Will you open it? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> You did not open 
the Cache Cube. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It's empty. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 
[2:FF05][3:FF01][2:FF01] x [3:FF02]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 
the Magatama [2:FF05][3:FF01][2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 
[2:FF05][3:FF01] Macca[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It's a trap. 
<end> 
<start>> Your party took damage. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It's empty. 
<end>

<start>[7:FF07]Do you see the other 
Assembly of Nihilo building 
across the railroad tracks? 
<end> 
<start>It doesn't look like the Mantra 
attacked that one. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The demons of Nihilo have returned 
to Ginza. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]It looks like the new world will 
finally be made. 
<end> 
<start>...What kind of world are you hoping 
for? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]See that building that's eating up 
the Magatsuhi of Tokyo? 
<end> 
<start>That's the Assembly of Nihilo. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The Mantra attacked the Assembly 
of Nihilo. 
<end> 
<start>Is this the end of Nihilo? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]What's going on? 
Didn't the Mantra win??? 
<end> 
<start>I heard that a bunch of Magatsuhi 
was sucked up from Ikebukuro!! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The Assembly of Nihilo sure is 
quiet... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The Nihilo demons were all worked 
up! 
<end> 
<start>They were saying something about 
how 'now is the time for creation'! 
Weird, huh? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Have you already met [2:FF02]Madame Nyx 
at the bar[2:FF01] in Ginza? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]She's so nice, listening to 
everyone's worries! 
<end> 
<start>She's helped me out so many times 
when I was in trouble. Her advice is 
priceless! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]She may technically be a demon... 
But she's real nice and will listen to 
your worries! 
<end> 
<start>You should see her whenever you're 
troubled. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]There's a place to get into 
the Great Underpass of Ginza 
somewhere around here... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Hmmm... I guess it's not that easy 
to find... 
<end> 
<start>Demons with the [2:FF02]Lucky Find[2:FF01] skill can 
can supposedly find stuff by just 
walking around outside. 
<end> 
<start>So, I was trying to do that. 
I mean, I could use the treasure! 
But, I guess it's not working... 
<end> 
<start>Hey, hey! There's a bunch of 
dangerous demons on the other 
end of the highway! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]This region is Nihilo's 
top priority. 
<end> 
<start>The security here is super-tight. 
<end> 
<start>There's an NPC in the  
other room. 
<end> 
<start>Erase. 
<start>[7:FF07]> You can sense a strong power 
from the end of the hall. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I didn't imagine that we would meet 
here... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Neither did I imagine that you would 
become this strong... 
<end> 
<start>...But in your case, I should have 
expected the unexpected. 
<end> 
<start>Do you remember me? 
<end> 
<start>I remember you... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...I am Thor. Our paths have not 
crossed since the fall of the Mantra. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...It seems that you are a follower 
of Yosuga. 
<end> 
<start>I am one as well. 
<end> 
<start>If the situation were different, 
we could have created a new world 
together... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]But, our battle is still unfinished. 
<end> 
<start>As believers of Yosuga, let us decide 
who the strongest is! 
<end> 
<start>Come on! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...Well... done. 
<end> 
<start>That power... That sheer will... 
...is truly worthy... of Yosuga. 
<end> 
<start>...I am your witness. 
<end> 
<start>It is my honor to die... by your... 
hands... 
<end> 
<start>............ 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Farewell. I hereby pledge to lend 
you my power... 
<end> 
<start>And... if you call... 
I will rise from the depths of hell 
to assist you... 
<end> 
<start>...I entrust you... with... the world 
of Yosuga! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Gaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh......!! 
<start>[7:FF07]...It seems that you and I have 
different objectives in climbing 
this tower... 
<end> 
<start>As a follower of Yosuga, I must 
annihilate you! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The world of Yosuga shall be built 
upon your lifeless body! 
<end> 
<start>Prepare to meet your doom! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]How can this be!? 
<end> 
<start>My powers are no match for yours!? 
<end> 
<start>............ 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...Even so!  
<end> 
<start>Lady [12:FF04] will certainly 
build a strong world with 
the teachings of Yosuga as its basis. 
<end> 
<start>Even though I will die here, 
Yosuga is... Y-Yosuga is...... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Gaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh......!! 
<start>[7:FF07]> you defeated Thor. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I've decided to take a rest here. 
Why don't you rest here, too? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]It's dangerous from here on. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Thou hast not the right to see me. 
<end> 
<start>Win all the Magatama and offer 
them to me. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> There is an altar. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Offer me your Magatama... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> There is an altar. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> A stone is already inserted. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Which stone will you offer? 
<end> 
<start>Earthstone. 
<start>[7:FF07]> You offered the [2:FF02]Earthstone[2:FF01]. 
<start>[7:FF07]> You offered the [2:FF02]Netherstone[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You offered the [2:FF02]Heavenstone[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You didn't offer anything. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You threw all three Magatama in! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You have proven yourself worthy. 
Come to me. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Will you go to Kagutsuchi? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> Will you leave the area? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> There is a Mystical Chest. 
Will you open it? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> You did not open 
the Mystical Chest. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 
[2:FF05][3:FF01][2:FF01] x [3:FF02]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You see a Cache Cube. 
Will you open it? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> You did not open 
the Cache Cube. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It's empty. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 
[2:FF05][3:FF01][2:FF01] x [3:FF02]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 
the Magatama [2:FF05][3:FF01][2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 
[2:FF05][3:FF01] Macca[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It's a trap. 
<end> 
<start>> Your party took damage. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It's empty. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> [3:FF03] found something. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]............ 
> You obtained 
[2:FF05][3:FF01][2:FF01] x [3:FF02]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It can't be used here. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The light effect wore off. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The repel effect wore off. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The attract effect wore off. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The levitation effect wore off. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Select a floor. 
<end> 
<start>[3:FF01][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF02][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF03][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF04][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF05][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF06][80EA] 
<start>[7:FF07]> You sense a strong power 
from beyond the door. 
<end> 
<start>> Will you enter? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]We've come pretty far up! 
<end> 
<start>We're all taking a rest now. 
We may be Manikins, but we're 
no dummies! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]There's a Mantra demon up ahead... 
<end> 
<start>He might hit us with his hammer 
if we get near him. And I already 
have a pounding headache. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...Is the hammer demon gone? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I'm tired of climbing... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]With everyone here, this place 
reminds me of Asakusa! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]............ 
<end> 
<start>...Oh, it's you again. 
<end> 
<start>I've decided to follow Futomimi's will 
and create a world of Manikins! 
<end> 
<start>So, I came all the way here, just to 
tell Kagutsuchi: "Make it!" 
<end> 
<start>But, there's a problem... 
<end> 
<start>I can't think up a Reason! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]What's going on!? 
I'm back here again!? 
<end> 
<start>I'll never make it to 
Lady [12:FF04]'s side 
at this rate! 
<end> 
<start>Let me check my map... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Did you know? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]There's an incredible treasure 
hidden in this tower that can 
manipulate life. 
<end> 
<start>After climbing steep paths, 
falling, scraping knees, 
finally... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Yeah, you climbed up this far; 
I guess you'd know already. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I saw Kagutsuchi from the path 
straight up north. 
<end> 
<start>Hmph, how arrogant it looks... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Lady [12:FF04] is much more 
elegant. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...Lady [12:FF04] was... 
much more elegant... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]If it isn't the Demi-fiend... 
<end> 
<start>We've been waiting for you, 
and that stone you have in 
your hands. 
<end> 
<start>Lady [12:FF04] is waiting for 
you up ahead. Please go on through. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]If it isn't the Demi-fiend... 
<end> 
<start>I'm surprised you have the nerve to 
even see us! 
<end> 
<start>Lady [12:FF04] is up ahead. 
<end> 
<start>Yosuga shall take that stone 
you have in your hands. 
...And your life. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Please lead us to the world of 
Yosuga... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]It... It can't be... 
<end> 
<start>...Yosuga... 
What will happen to Yosuga...? 
<end> 
<start>Lady [12:FF04]...... 
<end> 
<start>............ 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The top floor is up ahead. 
<end> 
<start>If you want to see Kagutsuchi, you 
need to offer the [2:FF02]three stones[2:FF01] to it. 
<end> 
<start>The stones are proof of Reason, so 
each leader should be carrying 
them. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The top floor is up ahead. 
<end> 
<start>If you're ready, go to the pedestal 
in front of the shrine. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Hey... Is that really you? 
<end> 
<start>[18:]...I don't know what to say. 
You came here all by yourself, 
on foot!? 
<end> 
<start>[18:]You must've gained some 
incredible power! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]I came here a little while ago... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]...using this. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Remember? 
You saw one just like it 
at the hospital. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]This isn't an ordinary piece 
of artwork. 
It's a truly amazing device. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]These are connected to each other 
by a strange passageway. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Using that passageway-- 
the Amala Network-- 
you can send anything to 
a distant location instantly. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]So basically, I transported myself 
here from the hospital. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]I'm guessing that there are more 
of these devices in different 
locations, and that they form 
a huge transportation network. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]...And most likely that network 
is connected to where Hikawa is. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Hey, wanna work together? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]If we're gonna have any hope 
of getting out of this mess, 
then we've got to find Hikawa. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]I heard there's a group in Ginza 
that's vying for control of 
shaping this infant world, 
<end> 
<start>[18:]and its leader is a human. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]That leader's gotta be Hikawa. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]So... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]I want you to try and find 
any information you can 
about that group. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]I'll use this device to send you 
to Ginza. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]...Well, what do you say? 
<end> 
<start>[18:]It's definitely risky, 
but it's better than 
wandering around on your own. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]...I'm gonna stay here for a while. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Let me know when you decide 
what you want to do. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]But, keep this in mind. 
I have no idea what things 
will be like in Ginza now. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]If you do decide to go there, 
make sure you prepare yourself, 
alright? 
<end> 
<start>[2:FF02]Dummy event for checking.[2:FF01] 
<end> 
<start>Test the transport function? 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Okay, here goes. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]If you change your mind, 
come back anytime. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]So, did you decide to enter 
the Amala Network? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]...Alright. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Once I send you, 
I'll head over to Ginza too. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Until then... stay alive. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Good luck!! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Tell me when you're ready. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]How arrogant... 
You misunderstand your purpose... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Return to earth, mud dolls!! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You're so weak, 
yet you struggle so hard to live. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Dreaming a dream of power... 
That's your sin. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...Help us, [13:FF01]! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]If you don't stop this woman, 
we will be massacred! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Oh, [12:FF01]... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Good timing. 
I keep killing and killing, 
but there are so many of them. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You would never partake in such 
a brutal act, would you? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Your heart is unlike any demon's... 
Is it not? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I'm sure you'll agree... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]...that only the strong should be 
allowed to exist in this world. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]The weak provoke and mislead 
others because they can do nothing 
themselves. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]As long as we have to deal 
with this pettiness, 
it will be impossible to create 
a beautiful world. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You understand what I'm saying, 
don't you? 
<end> 
<start>I see your point. 
<start>[7:FF07][80EA] 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You understand what I'm saying, 
don't you? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You too...? 
You will rob us of our dream...? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]No matter how much you demons 
threaten me, I will not yield! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]I will fight till the end 
to win our freedom!! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]...Oh. That's too bad. 
I thought you were different. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Why were you given 
a demon's body? 
You don't know the answer 
yourself, do you? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]You're not needed anymore... 
Goodbye. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]...You don't comprehend 
the Reason of Yosuga. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]You let the weak deceive you, 
so you forfeit your right to 
inherit the world with the strong. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Why were you given 
a demon's body? 
You don't know the answer 
yourself, do you? 
<end> 
<start>[18:]You're not needed anymore... 
Goodbye. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Who stirs the silence...? 
Who opposes the coming of 
the kingdom of Shijima? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]It is you... 
<end> 
<start>You have great strength. 
Your ideals, however, 
stand at odds with my own. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Vile deceiver! I shall destroy you, 
and erase your despicable greed! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Welcome... 
<end> 
<start>You who possesses great strength 
and bears the Reason of Shijima... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I shall share with you 
the Reason of Shijima... 
Let us enter the kingdom together. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]This stone I give to you as 
a token of our oath... 
<end> 
<start>Use it to open the gate 
of our kingdom. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained the [2:FF02]Earthstone[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Now, go. 
It is your fate to unleash 
the power of creation... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Obliterate those who believe in 
Reasons other than our own, 
and pave the way for the kingdom 
of Shijima! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Hey [12:FF01], 
you made it. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Sorry if I pressured you too much, 
but I managed to get here 
after all. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]It took a while, 
but I was finally able to pinpoint 
the route to this terminal. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Not bad for an ordinary human, eh? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Oh yeah, I found out something 
interesting about Asakusa. This is 
where the Manikins are created. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]They're made from the black mud 
that's scooped up from a river 
around here. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]No wonder they want to rebuild 
this town. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Oh yeah, I found out something 
interesting about this place. It's 
where the Manikins are created. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]They're made from the black mud 
that's scooped up from a river 
around here. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Quite a few of them returned 
here to Asakusa after the fall 
of the Mantra. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]I guess it's like coming home. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]...Anyways, like I suspected, 
the terminal here isn't under 
Nihilo's surveillance. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]It's perfect for monitoring 
their activities and finding out 
about the Nightmare System. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]I just started investigating, 
so I need some time. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]It shouldn't take too long, 
though. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Why don't you go look around 
for a while? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]So, while you were gone, 
I was working on that and... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Here, check this out. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Hey, good timing. 
How was Asakusa? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]About the Nightmare System... 
I've got good news. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]They say a picture is worth 
a thousand words... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]...so here, take a look. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You see it? 
That's the [2:FF02]Obelisk[2:FF01] in Chiyoda. 
<end> 
<start>The Nightmare System's inside it, 
along with all the Magatsuhi 
that's been collected. 
<end> 
<start>In other words, we've found 
Nihilo's current headquarters. 
<end> 
<start>...The system is probably being 
operated by that woman they call 
the Maiden. 
<end> 
<start>I have no idea how it works, 
but we know it's dangerous. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]If I could, I'd go in there myself, 
but I'm just not strong enough. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]However, if no one does anything, 
Hikawa will take over the world 
for sure. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]I'm afraid I have to ask for 
your help again, [12:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]You must stop the Nightmare 
System inside the Obelisk, 
and return the flow of Magatsuhi 
in the Vortex World back to normal. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Use [2:FF02]the secondary entrance 
to Nihilo's old headquarters[2:FF01] 
to reach the Obelisk. 
<end> 
<start>That entrance is locked right now, 
but I can take care of it. With this

[12:FF01]? 
<end> 
<start>[18:]My master is resting right now. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]...That's a very rare item that 
you have there. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]It's called the [2:FF02]Afterlife Bell[2:FF01]. 
It has the power to resurrect 
wandering souls. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]I thought it was still hidden in 
the Labyrinth of Amala... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]A Manikin must have stolen it 
and fled, in hopes of returning to 
the Vortex World. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]...Speaking of which, 
<end> 
<start>[18:]do you know how Manikins 
are born? 
<end> 
<start>[18:]They are originally fragments of 
human emotions... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]that acquire physical form and 
become sentient. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]When the Conception took place, 
Tokyo was purged of humans. 
<end> 
<start>It was a necessary step toward 
the rebirth of the world... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]But, even after they died, 
their souls lingered. 
And likewise... their emotions. 
<end> 
<start>Weak emotions dissipated instantly, 
but strong ones remained... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Those emotions sought receptacles, 
and found refuge in the substance 
closest to life... 
<end> 
<start>Earth. They merged with the earth 
and took shape one after another. 
<end> 
<start>For some, they became what 
they longed to be... 
For others, a side of them 
that they abhored surfaced. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Tokyo is currently in a state 
of transition, awaiting the day 
of creation. 
<end> 
<start>Of all the things in this world, 
some have ceased to exist, 
while others are adapting to 
the new world by changing form... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Human emotions became Manikins 
and inhabited the Vortex World. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Creation is forbidden to them, 
and their very existence will be 
denied once the new world has been 
born, but... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Some Manikins have possessed 
exceptional strength. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]If you bring them back to life 
with the [2:FF02]Afterlife Bell[2:FF01], 
<end> 
<start>they might join you and help you 
during your journey, even if it's 
only for a short while. 
<end> 
<start>It's worth a try. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...I think it's time for you 
to go back, [12:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>There are still things you 
have to do... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]I saw what happened, 
[12:FF01]... 
Too bad [12:FF03] got away. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]I'll go after him. 
You don't have to go 
inside Amala anymore. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]...Sorry, but I can't help you 
right now. 
I need to concentrate on this. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]If there's somewhere you want 
to go, don't wait for me. 
If not, why don't you check out 
Asakusa? 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Who knows...? 
You might find something new... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]...Sorry, but I can't help you 
right now. 
I need to concentrate on this. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]If there's somewhere you want 
to go, don't wait for me. 
If not, why don't you check out 
Asakusa? 
<end> 
<start>[18:]...Which reminds me, 
lately I've heard talk 
about Futomimi. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Are those Manikins 
up to something? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Damn that kid... 
What was he saying about being 
the master of Amala's power? 
<end> 
<start>[18:]That's it, playtime's over! 
I'm gonna kick you out of there, 
[12:FF03]!! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]What's up, [12:FF01]? 
Find anything interesting? 
<end> 
<start>[18:]I heard you can't get inside 
Mantra's headquarters right now. 
...The Manikins are worried. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Former members of Mantra could 
be involved, but most likely, 
they wouldn't try anything 
without a leader. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]...Which reminds me, 
lately I've heard talk 
about Futomimi. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Maybe those Manikins are up to 
something themselves... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]I'll take care of [12:FF03], 
so don't worry. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]...I'll track him down and 
kick him out of the network. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]I've got no updates 
on [12:FF03]. 
Is he playing dead or what...? 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Oh well, he'll give himself away 
eventually. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]...In the meantime, 
why don't you go find out 
about Futomimi? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Hey, [12:FF01]. 
I can't believe what happened 
in Ikebukuro... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]The return of Gozu-Tennoh... 
I hope it won't create 
even bigger problems. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]...I bet you're wondering 
how I know about it already. 
Well, nothing escapes me now. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]I can learn anything 
with the power of Amala, 
just by using this terminal... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]For example, here's what's going on 
right now in the Vortex World: 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Hikawa is on his way to 
the Diet Building, 
in search of Magatsuhi. 
<start>[7:FF07]Some girl named [12:FF04] 
has inherited the power 
of Gozu-Tennoh. 
<start>[7:FF07]There's an abandoned temple where 
a ton of Magatsuhi lies forgotten. 
<start>[7:FF07]Manikins are gathered 
in Mifunashiro, their holy ground, 
demanding their own Reason. 
<start>[7:FF07]And... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]That's all you really need to know 
right now. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]You see, no one knows more about 
the Vortex World than I do. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]That's why I should be the one 
creating the new world! 
<end> 
<start>[18:]...Not Hikawa, or your teacher, 
or even you! 
<end> 
<start>[18:]I could truly change the world! 
...Me, and me alone! 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Everything in existence! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You're the one who should have 
stayed out, Hijiri. 
I warned you, too... 
<end> 
<start>But, it's too late now. 
You can't escape my punishment... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]It's [12:FF03]! 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Damn it, you should be dead... 
I won't let you have 
the power of Amala!! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]...What!? He's pulling me in...!! 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]It's [12:FF03]! 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Damn it, you should be dead... 
I won't let you have 
the power of Amala!! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]UOOOOOOOHHH! 
<start>[80EA][80EA] 
<start>[7:FF07]> Hijiri disappeared into 
the Amala Network. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The terminal is still active. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Will you use the terminal 
to go after Hijiri? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Will you use the terminal 
to go after Hijiri? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> You used the terminal. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You left the terminal alone. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Oh... I wasn't expecting you, 
[12:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]My master is resting right now. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]If you're here for information, 
I'd be glad to help you. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]...Is there anything else you want 
to ask about, [12:FF01]? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]...Alright. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]I'll try to help you as much as I can. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]So, what is it that you'd like 
to know about? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]...Then, you should get going. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]I look forward to seeing you again... 
<end> 
<start>I want to ask you about something. 
<start>The Vortex World 
<start>The Vortex World 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Okay... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Listen closely. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]...Then, you should get going. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]I look forward to seeing you again... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]What is it? 
<end> 
<start>You wanna know what games 
humans used to play? 
<end> 
<start>I already beat this game... 
<end> 
<start>Well, you won't survive a minute. 
It's over before it even starts. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]If you can win, I'll give you 
an [2:FF02]insect-like thing[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>Okay! Why don't you try? 
<end> 
<start>You're on! 
<start>[7:FF07]Oh, you're back. I don't have 
anything for you, but... 
<end> 
<start>I'm not stopping you from playing. 
So, why don't you try? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You don't have to go along with me, 
you know? Well, it's okay... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Well, I don't mind. 
<end> 
<start>You don't have to push yourself 
anyway... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You can come again, you know. 
<end> 
<start>Well, I've beaten it anyway. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Ummm... So... 
<end> 
<start>I guess that means you beat it, 
right? 
<end> 
<start>Ugh...... 
<end> 
<start>...That's fine. You can have this 
[2:FF02]insect-like thing[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Hey! No playing games right now! 
<end> 
<start>Mifunashiro is in danger! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained the Magatama 
[2:FF03]Geis[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]When the going gets tough, it's best 
to escape into the world of games... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The city is silent. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I'm new here, so I don't know 
the details... 
<end> 
<start>But, this place was bustling with 
Manikins just a short while back. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]............ 
<end> 
<start>............ 
<end> 
<start>...I'm tired of it all! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Futomimi is dead... 
Creation of a new world by 
the Manikins is now impossible. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]About the old Manikin that was 
here... 
<end> 
<start>Despite saying that he was tired 
of it all, he still went to 
the Tower of Kagutsuchi. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Ah... 
<end> 
<start>Having to live like this again... 
*sigh* Life is short... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> There's no response from 
the Manikin. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The Manikins are falling apart, 
since the dream of their world and 
Futomimi are both gone. 
<end> 
<start>I'm not a Musubi, but I think 
they should've respected themselves 
more. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The flames of the [2:FF02]Candelabrum 
of Sovereignty[2:FF01] are flickering wildly... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You can feel the presence of 
a terrifying demon... 
<end> 
<start>> Will you stay here? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> Are you sure? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF02]> ............ 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It looks like you'll be able to 
get away. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It looks like you won't be able to 
escape... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I know you have a candelabrum! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The flames of the candelabrum 
burn passionately! 
You won't escape! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Will you leave the area? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> There is a Mystical Chest. 
Will you open it? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> You did not open 
the Mystical Chest. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 
[2:FF05][3:FF01][2:FF01] x [3:FF02]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You see a Cache Cube. 
Will you open it? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> You did not open 
the Cache Cube. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It's empty. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 
[2:FF05][3:FF01][2:FF01] x [3:FF02]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 
the Magatama [2:FF05][3:FF01][2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 
[2:FF05][3:FF01] Macca[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It's a trap. 
<end> 
<start>> Your party took damage. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It's empty. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> [3:FF03] found something. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]............ 
> You obtained 
[2:FF05][3:FF01][2:FF01] x [3:FF02]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It can't be used here. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The light effect wore off. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The repel effect wore off. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The attract effect wore off. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The levitation effect wore off. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Select a floor. 
<end> 
<start>[3:FF01][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF02][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF03][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF04][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF05][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF06][80EA] 
<start>[7:FF07]We're still restoring this area. 
<end> 
<start>It'll be a while before you'll be able 
to get through here. 
<end> 
<start>Come back later. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]We finally restored the area. Now, 
you can go and look around. 
<end> 
<start>...It's full of demons, though. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]This city is pretty shabby. There are 
places we can't even get through. 
<end> 
<start>...But, we'll clean it all up, because 
it's our city! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]We fixed up the area just past those 
doors! 
<end> 
<start>Use it if you're going to Ueno or 
the [2:FF02]Asakusa Tunnel[2:FF01]! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Welcome to Asakusa, the city of 
the Manikins. 
<end> 
<start>...Ah, it has such a sweet ring to it. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Welcome! This is Asakusa, the city 
of Manikins. 
<end> 
<start>*sigh* Finally, our creation will begin... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]We're no longer the slaves we used 
to be. 
<end> 
<start>We're free! There's nothing that can 
hurt us now! 
<end> 
<start>The Mantra? We don't give a damn! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]We can't be weak forever! 
<end> 
<start>Now, it's our turn to enslave 
the demons! 
<end> 
<start>...That's the mindset we need to be 
at. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]*gasp* I heard from an old friend! 
<end> 
<start>There's [2:FF02]another demon[2:FF01] at the Great 
Underpass! 
<end> 
<start>It's a horrific demon on a red horse! 
<end> 
<start>But... I'm in Asakusa, so why should 
I get all excited? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]............!? 
<end> 
<start>...Whoa! 
<end> 
<start>It's you! Do you remember me? 
<end> 
<start>...How've you been? Alright? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...I see. You've been through a lot, 
haven't you? I'm not a demon, but 
I sort of understand... 
<end> 
<start>Well, we're doing well living in 
Asakusa. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I see, I see! 
<end> 
<start>We're doing well living in Asakusa. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]This is all thanks to Futomimi's 
leadership. 
<end> 
<start>Futomimi is in our holy land of 
[2:FF02]Mifunashiro[2:FF01]. Go and see him. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]This is all thanks to Futomimi's 
leadership. 
<end> 
<start>Futomimi is at our holy land of 
[2:FF02]Mifunashiro[2:FF01]. Go and see him. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Futomimi is deep inside Mifunashiro, 
praying to see the future. 
<end> 
<start>Sometimes it takes awhile, 
sometimes it doesn't... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Is it impossible for us Manikins to 
participate in the creation? 
<end> 
<start>...No, we have Futomimi! It must be 
possible! 
<end> 
<start>We'll make it... A world without 
humans or demons--just Manikins! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Our holy land, Mifunashiro, is just 
past here. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]If everyone's a Manikin, then 
everyone's friendly? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]It's great that we're free, but what do 
we do now? 
<end> 
<start>...I'm not used to this. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Uh... Ugh...... 
<end> 
<start>It's Sa...[2:FF02]Sakahagi[2:FF01]... 
<end> 
<start>Th-That traitor, Sakahagi is going 
wild... up ahead... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Uh... Ugh...... 
<end> 
<start>...Sakahagi left... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]S-Sakahagi ruins our peace... 
<end> 
<start>He's an evil Manikin... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You sense a strong power from 
beyond the door. 
<end> 
<start>> Will you enter? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]If you go on further, you'll reach 
[2:FF02]Mifunashiro[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>It's a place not to be defiled by 
demons or humans. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Phew!! So busy... 
<end> 
<start>...Oh! It's you! 
<end> 
<start>It's me, remember? Y'know, from 
the Underpass and the Prison... Me! 
<end> 
<start>...I was thinking of opening a store 
here--making use of all my 
experience. 
<end> 
<start>It's a mess now, so it'll be a while 
before I'll be able to open up. 
<end> 
<start>But, I'll hook you up, so come on by 
after I open! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I'm going to start a store that sells 
a bunch of rare things. 
<end> 
<start>Come by once I open! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The inner areas have been restored, 
I hear. We still have a ways to go, 
though. 
<end> 
<start>I want to open up soon. Well, better 
get back to work. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Those days when I used to be 
tortured by the Mantra... 
<end> 
<start>Oh, it felt sooooo good! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]A world... full of peachy Manikins... 
<end> 
<start>...Isn't that just faaaaaaaaaabulous? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]What's wrong!? What happened!? 
Tell me, hun!! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Things have been heating up in 
Ikebukuro lately. 
<end> 
<start>I heard someone saw [2:FF02]Hikawa[2:FF01] by 
the building that used to be 
the Mantra's headquarters. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Geez... Everyone's so into this 
creation stuff. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...We finally restored the area, but 
it's filled with demons. 
<end> 
<start>Oh, well. 
<end> 
<start>Futomimi should be ready to give 
his prophecy at Mifunashiro. 
<end> 
<start>I think I'll go there. Are you going? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Yoyogi Park's in danger, I hear. 
<end> 
<start>Are you going? 
<end> 
<start>You can get there by taking the path 
where the Collector Manikin opened 
his store. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The evil power at Yoyogi Park was 
Sakahagi, and he's already been 
defeated, I hear. 
<end> 
<start>Thank goodness. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The lounge in Ginza and the club in 
Shibuya are great places for info. 
<end> 
<start>You visiting them? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]There's a strange guy living in 
the terminal. You know him? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Then, you should drop by once in 
a while, to check up on him. 
<end> 
<start>Take the advice of a long-time 
Asakusa resident! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I see... 
<end> 
<start>Well, I've been living here longer 
than he has. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]So, is that guy who lived at 
the Asakusa terminal doing okay? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I see... 
<end> 
<start>Well, tell him I said "hi". 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I see. 
<end> 
<start>I guess it must be pretty rough. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...What? 
<end> 
<start>We believe in coexistence, so 
there's no violence here. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Looks like something happened 
to the Manikins. 
<end> 
<start>Well, we don't really care. 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]You're pretty adventurous, coming 
all this way. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The northern part of the city is 
restored, and now you can go 
inside! 
<end> 
<start>...But, we weren't the first ones 
here... 
<end> 
<start>Well, we're still pumped up. I'm 
going to help restore the city, too. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The Collector Manikin opened 
a store. 
<end> 
<start>He's got a lot of things, from 
side-effect drinks to insect-like 
things. 
<end> 
<start>It's up ahead on your left. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The Collector Manikin opened 
a store. 
<end> 
<start>He's got a lot of things, from 
side-effect drinks to insect-like 
things. 
<end> 
<start>It's up ahead on your left. 
<end> 
<start>...But, sometimes I feel a [2:FF02]strange 
presence[2:FF01] around there. 
<end> 
<start>It's kinda scary... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Welcome to the slums of Asakusa! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]No... 
<end> 
<start>Futomimi... 
<end> 
<start>Futomimi...!! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> There is no response from 
the Manikin. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]We're working hard to restore 
the city, but there's a bad Manikin 
that's ruining our peace. 
<end> 
<start>He's ruthless, tearing off the skins of 
other Manikins. 
<end> 
<start>He might be around here, so be 
careful!  
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]We're working hard to restore 
the city, but there's a bad Manikin 
that's ruining our peace. 
<end> 
<start>His name's Sakahagi. 
<end> 
<start>He steals Magatsuhi from other 
Manikins and plans to rule other 
demons. What a dummy! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I hear Sakahagi's dead. 
<end> 
<start>...Hmph, serves him right! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The Mantra has fallen and the damn 
Manikins have moved into town. 
<end> 
<start>There goes the neighborhood... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Nowadays, those damn Manikins are 
talking about creation... 
<end> 
<start>Hope nothin' bad happens. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]There are demons in Mifunashiro! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Those damn Manikins aren't all 
dead yet. 
<end> 
<start>There's still some 'round here. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]What!? What!? The Manikins sure 
are noisy! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]What!? What!? The Manikins sure 
are bustling! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]What!? What!? What's going on!? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...It's become quiet. 
<end> 
<start>Manikins were running about here, 
not long ago... 
<end> 
<start>Now, demons are here instead. 
<end> 
<start>Is this the flow of time? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]......... 
<end> 
<start>Futomimi...... 
<end> 
<start>Mifunashiro's...!! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]............ 
<end> 
<start>Shhh! 
<end> 
<start>Sakahagi'll find me! Go away! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]............ 
<end> 
<start>...Is Sakahagi gone yet? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]............ 
<end> 
<start>...Huh? Creation by Manikins? 
<end> 
<start>...I'm scared of Sakahagi, so I'll stay 
like this for a while longer. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]............ 
<end> 
<start>...Mifunashiro's...!? 
<end> 
<start>...I'm scared. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]............ 
<end> 
<start>............ 
<end> 
<start>...Maybe lying here wasn't such 
a great idea. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Looking just at Asakusa, it's 
heartwarming to see the Manikins 
restore the town... 
<end> 
<start>But, looking at Tokyo as a whole, we 
see Nihilo taking over, and that's no 
laughing matter. 
<end> 
<start>Nihilo has no rival. Are we just going 
to sit here, watching Hikawa make 
his world of stillness? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Nihilo's Nightmare System is at 
a standstill. 
<end> 
<start>Strange things are happening at 
Ikebukuro and the Amala Network. 
<end> 
<start>Now, what's going to happen? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]They've begun... 
<end> 
<start>...Yosuga, that is. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...The Manikins have retired from 
the race. 
<end> 
<start>Yosuga, Shijima, Musubi... 
<end> 
<start>These three are all competing for 
the right of creation. 
<end> 
<start>I don't know who you're for, and I 
don't want to know. 
<end> 
<start>But, the time is nearing. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I heard there was a human girl 
hanging around the Mantra's 
headquarters when they fell. 
<end> 
<start>She must have some guts. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Something's happening at 
Ikebukuro. 
<end> 
<start>Could it be the human girl who 
witnessed the fall of the Mantra!? 
<end> 
<start>...Just kidding!!!! Did you fall for 
that? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]A demon girl is attacking 
Mifunashiro! 
<end> 
<start>...It really was the Ikebukuro girl... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Yosuga, was it? The Ikebukuro girl's 
Reason. 
<end> 
<start>I like it. I mean, why do I have to live 
with all these losers? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The Maiden was Nihilo's key to 
destroying the Mantra. 
<end> 
<start>What was it? The 'Nightmare 
System'? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The Nightmare System was put to 
a halt by someone. 
<end> 
<start>Isn't this bad for Nihilo? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The Yosuga are the ones attacking 
Mifunashiro. 
<end> 
<start>They're probably after all 
the Magatsuhi the Manikins have 
been storing. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The Manikins were wiped out... 
<end> 
<start>...I don't like the idea of a world 
controlled by power. 
<end> 
<start>Living here, I've realized that 
Nihilo's Reason of Shijima is 
the best. No more fighting, please. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Futomimi is meditating at 
Mifunashiro. 
<end> 
<start>He sees the future by meditating. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Why... 
<end> 
<start>Why are we...? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I wonder... 
<end> 
<start>What happened to the human boy at 
the Mantra's jail? Did he escape? 
<end> 
<start>...That hat bugs me. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]There's evil power at Yoyogi Park, 
I hear. 
<end> 
<start>But, we worked together to build 
this city. 
<end> 
<start>We'll beat down that evil power! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Hmmm... 
<end> 
<start>Was the evil power of Yoyogi really 
Sakahagi? 
<end> 
<start>Why doesn't Futomimi say, "The evil 
power is gone"? Sakahagi's dead! 
<end> 
<start>Hmmm... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]'Evil power'... 
<end> 
<start>It's him. Definitely him. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The evil power of Yoyogi was 
Sakahagi. 
<end> 
<start>But, he's dead, so I could care less 
now. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The's a temple on the north side of 
Ueno. 
<end> 
<start>But, you can't get in, so there's 
nothing to see. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]If you go south from the exit up 
ahead, you'll reach Yushima Station. 
<end> 
<start>There's a giant hole there. We call it 
the Asakusa Tunnel. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]It's been real quiet... 
<end> 
<start>Where did the Manikins go? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The creation of the world, huh...? 
<end> 
<start>If you lose, you're out. That's pretty 
tough... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I saw Sakahagi earlier. 
<end> 
<start>He went down the hall. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Huh? Sakahagi's dead? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I see... 
<end> 
<start>Now that Futomimi's dead, 
Asakusa's nothing but a ghost town. 
<end> 
<start>It's just as Lady [12:FF04] 
said. 
<end> 
<start>We need to watch Ginza... 
...The Assembly of Nihilo. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...Finally, it's time to head for 
Kagutsuchi! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Hmmm... This is one boring town. 
No clubs, no bars. 
<end> 
<start>Well, I guess it's a good place to 
kick back and relax... There's no 
one around, so I can enjoy some 
peace and quiet. 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> Add which candelabrum to 
inventory? 
<end> 
<start>Dignity 
<start>[7:FF07]What do you want to do? 
<end> 
<start>Black Visor flag on 
<start>[7:FF07]> There is a huge pedestal. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You do not have a candelabrum 
for this pedestal... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Will you light the [2:FF02]Candelabrum 
of Dignity[2:FF01]? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Will you light the [2:FF02]Candelabrum 
of Eternity[2:FF01]? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> You lit the [2:FF02]Candelabrum 
of Dignity[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You lit the [2:FF02]Candelabrum 
of Eternity[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You did not light the candelabrum. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> All of the candelabra 
have been lit... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> There is room for another 
candelabrum on the pedestal... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The flames illuminate the passage 
beyond. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> There is a peephole... 
<end> 
<start>> Will you look through it? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Please retrieve the next set 
of candelabra and return them 
to the Labyrinth. 
<end> 
<start>We are deeply grateful for 
your work. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The voice of the lady in black 
can be heard through the peephole... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The lady's voice could no longer 
be heard. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The hole is blocked... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The path is blocked... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> There is a shaft leading downward. 
<end> 
<start>> Jump in? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Return to the entrance 
of the Labyrinth? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Return to the previous Kalpa? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> There is a tombstone without

the fallen angel... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...Do you know what cause 
you serve? 
<end> 
<start>Do you realize which path your 
actions are leading you down...? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I have watched your every move 
from above. 
<end> 
<start>You have been seduced by 
darkness, 
<end> 
<start>and now you are about to defy 
god's will. 
<end> 
<start>[13:FF01], the one with 
a demon's body and a human heart, 
heed my warning! 
<end> 
<start>End your dealings with the fallen 
angel, before your heart is 
consumed by darkness! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...May you be blessed by the light. 
<end> 
<start>As long as you do not assist him, 
his evil plans will surely fail. 
<end> 
<start>Now, return to your world. 
Here, the power of chaos will 
overwhelm you... 
<end> 
<start>I am one with god... 
I am his mouthpiece... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...Woe unto you, for you can 
no longer discern good from evil... 
<end> 
<start>In this land where demons of chaos 
dwell, the last of your humanity 
will eventually be lost. 
<end> 
<start>I pray that you return to your world 
and rid yourself of darkness, 
before it is too late... 
<end> 
<start>before god's vengeance strikes 
this cursed land... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The voice could no longer be heard. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Gee, you look worn out. 
<end> 
<start>Would you like to rest for a while? 
Only 500 Macca! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Oh... Well, please come again! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Oh, you don't have enough Macca... 
Come back when you do. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You must be thirsty. 
Here, have a drink... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Your party recovered. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Go ahead, have some more... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Are you feeling better? 
Here's some more... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Your party recovered some more. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...Have... another... drink... 
<start>[7:FF07]> Your wallet feels really light... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Will you leave the area? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> There is a Mystical Chest. 
Will you open it? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> You did not open 
the Mystical Chest. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 
[2:FF05][3:FF01][2:FF01] x [3:FF02].

<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It's a trap. 
<end> 
<start>> Your party took damage.

<start>[7:FF07]> There is a shaft leading upward. 
<end> 
<start>> Jump in? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The path is blocked... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> There is a tombstone without 
a name on it... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]............ 
<end> 
<start>I can't believe someone would really 
come all the way down here... 
<end> 
<start>...You see, I made a bet with 
a buddy of mine. 
<end> 
<start>If someone actually made it this far 
down, I'd have to give that person 
a prize. 
<end> 
<start>Looks like I lost. 
Here, take this. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 250000 Macca. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I like you. Come back later and I'll 
tell you something you might wanna 
know. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Alright, I'll tell you something you 
might wanna know.... 
<end> 
<start>My drinking buddy is somewhere up 
in Tokyo having a drink. 
<end> 
<start>He's got the key that opens 
the golden doors. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Meet my friend? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]A lot of souls have been gathering 
in the Labyrinth. 
<end> 
<start>Everyone around here keeps 
arguing about Gaea and Messiah, 
whatever those are... 
<end> 
<start>Well, if you walk around, you'll see. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]We believed in living in harmony 
with demons. 
<end> 
<start>But, the Order of Messiah wouldn't 
accept that, and a conflict erupted. 
<end> 
<start>What we didn't realize was that our 
worst enemy was already among us. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...You must never forget to say 
your prayers. 
<end> 
<start>If you pray, god will protect you 
no matter what happens. 
<end> 
<start>And, you shall eventually join him 
in the afterlife... Now, let us pray. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]God spoke to us and foretold 
the destruction of Tokyo. 
<end> 
<start>We chased after the Gaea cult 
in order to prevent that. 
<end> 
<start>But, we were done in by that 
devil summoner... 
<end> 
<start>Hikawa is a dangerous man... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Do me a favor... 
<end> 
<start>Don't bother me. 
<end> 
<start>My pleasure. 
<start>[7:FF07]...... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...... 
<end> 
<start>...Then, give me 10000 Macca. 
If you don't like it, then go 
somewhere else. So, do you want 
my help or not? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> ...... 
<end> 
<start>> Dr. Dark healed your party. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]A long, long time ago... 
I was summoned by a human, 
and we talked of many things. 
<end> 
<start>What he had to say was very 
interesting. 
<end> 
<start>Do you want to hear it? 
<end> 
<start>Sure, why not? 
<start>[7:FF07]The man used black magic to 
summon me. 
<end> 
<start>This is what he said: 
"Kill the man I hate!" 
<end> 
<start>I asked, "Is that what humans do, 
kill those they hate?" 
<end> 
<start>He replied, "If you hate, you kill. 
That's the way we are." 
<end> 
<start>I admired those words. 
It's so demon-like... 
the true nature of humans. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I see... If you change your mind, 
come back anytime. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You don't want to go any further. 
<end> 
<start>It's cursed, y'know. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The curse has been undone. 
<end> 
<start>You can go now. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Y-Y-You know what...? 
<end> 
<start>...If you look real carefully, 
you might find a hidden passage. 
<end> 
<start>B-B-But, they're hard to spot. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I just heard a voice coming from 
your direction. 
<end> 
<start>It was like the voice of 
the universe... You weren't harmed, 
were you? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]That incredible power... 
It might've been the Great Will 
coming to observe us. 
<end> 
<start>Well, not even he can stop our 
master's plans now. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]It's natural for every living thing 
to die... Treatment, therefore, 
contradicts nature. 
<end> 
<start>So... Did you come here to defy 
nature and be treated? 
<end> 
<start>No. 
<start>[7:FF07]Good. One lives, one dies... 
That's the way it should be. 
<end> 
<start>I pray that you find rest soon. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...I am a doctor, after all. 
I'll treat your wounds. 
<end> 
<start>But, I'm gonna charge you 
[3:FF01] Macca. Alright? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> ...... 
<end> 
<start>> Dr. Dark healed your party. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...... 
<end> 
<start>Money first. Get outta here. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Hey, see? There, right there! 
<end> 
<start>Oh, come on now. 
<end> 
<start>That wall right there. Open your 
eyes and look! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Everyone, listen! 
<end> 
<start>The world has lost its power under 
the reign of god. 
<end> 
<start>Because of that, we are on the 
verge of destruction. 
<end> 
<start>But, there is no need to fear. 
The Gaea cult will ensure our 
survival! 
<end> 
<start>Together, we will resurrect 
the strength of the ancient world! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The soul is still preaching... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The soul is too busy talking to 
notice you. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]We are just looking for a way 
to live in peace with nature 
and the ancient gods. 
<end> 
<start>But, the Order of Messiah, 
brainwashed by a jealous god, 
won't allow us to do so. 
<end> 
<start>...I'm telling you, they're 
the ones who should be oppressed, 
not us! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]We believe that god's teachings 
are absolute. 
<end> 
<start>Everything is his will... 
Everything changes at his will... 
<end> 
<start>You must leave this dreaded place 
and fulfill the part which you 
were originally intended for. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I see thou art in anticipation. 
<end> 
<start>There needeth not be reason 
to hide it... About that... 
<end> 
<start>I understand thy joy! I cannot 
suppress mine own. 
<end> 
<start>As another friend to drink 
mead with, I shall tell thee 
something interesting. 
<end> 
<start>If thou takest purple Macca 
in succession, thine earning 
shall be even more. 
<end> 
<start>Try and [2:FF02]strikest[2:FF01] anything you can. 
I have become rich that way! 
Hahahaha! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...I'm glad you made it here. 
<end> 
<start>...If you get stronger... 
<end> 
<start>...I'll sell you something special. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...I've got nothing else 
to sell you. 
...Hey, don't worry. 
<end> 
<start>I'm sure there are other brokers 
besides me in this labyrinth. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...You're pretty strong. 
<end> 
<start>...I'll sell you something special. 
Interested? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...On second thought, 
forget what I just said. 
<end> 
<start>The demon you have there... 
Yeah, that yellow one... 
<end> 
<start>As long as you've got that demon 
with you, I can't sell you mine. 
Come back after you get rid of it. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...You're pretty strong. 
<end> 
<start>I'll sell you something special. 
<end> 
<start>Uh... Wait a minute, 
your party's full. 
<end> 
<start>If you want a new companion, 
make some room first and then 
come back. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Here's what I'm selling... 
<end> 
<start>...a demon that can heal 
anything. You'll be glad to have 
one around. 
<end> 
<start>With that well-rounded bosom, 
I think anyone would rise to 
heaven getting healed by her! 
<end> 
<start>I'm asking 30000 Macca. 
I know it's kinda high, 
but it's well worth the price... 
So, you want it? 
<end> 
<start>Alright, I'll buy it. 
<start>[7:FF07]Excellent choice! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You purchased a demon from 
the Shady Broker. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I am Nda Mitama. 
<end> 
<start>With my magic, I can 
weaken the enemy. 
<end> 
<start>Nice to meet you. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The demon joined your party. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]That's fine. 
If you change your mind, 
feel free to come back anytime. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Hey-hey-hey, you don't have 
enough Macca! 
<end> 
<start>Come back when you have more 
money, okay? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The floor below is a place 
filled with invisible walls. 
<end> 
<start>If you're heading down 
below, you better be prepared. 
<end> 
<start>Once you're down there, it 
won't be easy coming back up. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Will you leave the area? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> There is a Mystical Chest. 
Will you open it? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> You did not open

<start>Good. Looks like you're still safe. 
<end> 
<start>It seems that the Link failed and 
you fell into the Amala Network. 
<end> 
<start>But... The Amala Network is exactly 
that: a network. 
<end> 
<start>If there's an entrance, there's 
always an exit. 
<end> 
<start>Just leave it to me. I'll get you out, 
so head toward Ginza... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]......? 
<end> 
<start>Something's up... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Are you stuck? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Alright, let me try something. 
Gimme a minute. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Okay... 
<end> 
<start>I've got an idea. Let me try 
something... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I'm starting to get it... 
<end> 
<start>Looks like the Amala Network never 
stays the same shape. 
<end> 
<start>Even you would have a hard time 
getting through here... 
<end> 
<start>Well, if something happens, call me. 
I'll do what I can. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...Geez, again? 
<end> 
<start>Hopefully, it'll be as smooth as 
the last time... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]......! 
<end> 
<start>...H...ey...... 
Ca...n...yo...hear...e? 
Say...som...ing... 
<end> 
<start>...Dam...it...! 
Conn...ction's...unst...ble... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You can no longer hear 
Hijiri's voice. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> This is where the stairs 
disappeared... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You can hear a voice... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...y...he......y... 
It...me......Hijiri. 
<end> 
<start>...Can you hear me? Answer me! 
Can you hear me now? 
<end> 
<start>I can hear you. 
<start>[7:FF07]Good! Looks like you're in a spot 
that gets good reception. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Yeah, real funny... I know you hear 
me, kid! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Alright... Let's do it this way. 
<end> 
<start>From now on, if anything happens, 
let's meet up in stable places like 
the one you're in right now. 
<end> 
<start>...Oh, yeah. You're stuck, huh? 
Just wait a...sec... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...Damn. 
<end> 
<start>Looks like...communica...ion's... 
get...ing...ba...d......he...re...too... 
<end> 
<start>Let...s...meet...u...p...in... 
a...nother...stab...le...plac...e... 
<end> 
<start>............ 
<end> 
<start>......Okay...? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You cannot hear Hijiri's voice 
anymore. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You hear nothing. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You can hear a voice... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]............ 
<end> 
<start>It's good to know you're alive. 
Guess you didn't become a demon 
for nothing. 
<end> 
<start>You couldn't go any further, huh? 
Wait up. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]..Oh yeah, there's something you 
should know. 
<end> 
<start>It seems that someone's trying to 
intercept my communication with 
you. 
<end> 
<start>Might be an enemy. Be care...ful... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]......Looks like...it's...get...ing... 
...un...stable...he...re...to...o...... 
<end> 
<start>We'll...tal...k...la...er... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Hijiri's voice died away. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You can hear a voice... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You're finally here... 
<end> 
<start>The exit is close to where you are. 
Let me open the-- 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]............! 
<end> 
<start>...Dammit, something's interfering... 
<end> 
<start>......He...y... 
Yo...u......ok...ay...?

<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]............ 
<end> 
<start>......Alright... 
It looks like...everything's 
stabilizing. 
<end> 
<start>Hey, [12:FF01], you okay? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I see... You're getting used to being 
a demon, aren't ya? 
<end> 
<start>I'll open the door. Hang on. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Alright, I'll do the best I can to 
get you outta there. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]If you go through the path I opened, 
you should reach [2:FF02]Ginza[2:FF01] safely. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You did take a slight detour, but 
at least you're there. 
<end> 
<start>Nice work. Now, let's hurry on. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You cannot hear Hijiri's voice 
anymore. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> There is a wall... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Will you leave the area? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> There is a Mystical Chest. 
Will you open it? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> You did not open 
the Mystical Chest. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 
[2:FF05][3:FF01][2:FF01] x [3:FF02]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You see a Cache Cube. 
Will you open it? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> You did not open 
the Cache Cube. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It's empty. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 
[2:FF05][3:FF01][2:FF01] x [3:FF02]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 
the Magatama [2:FF05][3:FF01][2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 
[2:FF05][3:FF01] Macca[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It's a trap. 
<end> 
<start>> Your party took damage. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It's empty. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> [3:FF03] found something. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]............ 
> You obtained 
[2:FF05][3:FF01][2:FF01] x [3:FF02]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It can't be used here. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The light effect wore off. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The repel effect wore off. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The attract effect wore off. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The levitation effect wore off. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Select a floor. 
<end> 
<start>[3:FF01][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF02][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF03][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF04][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF05][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF06][80EA] 
<start>[7:FF07]What...? Get lost! 
<end> 
<start>I don't wanna talk to anyone. 
<end> 
<start>I'll heal you if you just go away. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> ............ 
<end> 
<start>> The soul healed you. 
<end> 
<start>I'll heal you anytime. Just don't 
bug me. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> This is where the stairs were. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...What do you want? I'm not looking 
for someone to talk to. 
<end> 
<start>If you really want to talk, there's 
a place where you can talk to 
the outside world... 
<end> 
<start>...So talk all you want there. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]If I were you, I'd go right for sure. 
<end> 
<start>Oops! 
<end> 
<start>I should learn to keep my mouth 
shut... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Er, left! I meant left! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You're not from around here, 
are you? 
<end> 
<start>Then, let me warn you... 
<end> 
<start>If you don't have a map, you'll get 
lost. 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]You want me to tell you something 
good? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I see... Guess I'm too nosy. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You see the red things running 
along the walls and roof? 
<end> 
<start>That's all Magatsuhi. 
<end> 
<start>Magatsuhi is born from the flow of 
emotions, such as suffering, anxiety, 
and sadness... 
<end> 
<start>That's right. Emotions bring forth 
great powers. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]There's an enormous amount of 
Magatsuhi in the Amala Network. 
<end> 
<start>So, there are demons that jump in 
here, looking for Magatsuhi. 
<end> 
<start>Be careful not to be picked on. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Just a while back, this used to be 
connected to the Ginza terminal. 
<end> 
<start>But... the network is in a bad mood, 
as you can see. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]*whistle* 
<end> 
<start>The wall just went POOF! and 
disappeared. 
<end> 
<start>So, now it's connected to 
the Ginza terminal, but... 
<end> 
<start>...I wish you were here to see it 
happen. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]What? Go away... 
<end> 
<start>I don't want to involve myself with 
anyone or anything! 
<end> 
<start>I'll heal you. Just get outta my face. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> ............ 
<end> 
<start>> You have been healed. 
<end> 
<start>I'll heal you anytime, so leave me 
alone. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Thought you got away? 
<end> 
<start>[18:]...You're wrong, pal. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Checkmate! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]I could go ahead and kill you 
right now, but... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]...I'm not really in the mood 
to do any favors for my shady 
old client. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]...So, I'll give you 
a sporting chance. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Don't worry, it's not complicated. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]I'm gonna chase you around 
this floor. If you reach the exit, 
you win. If not... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Bang! ...Got it? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Time to get serious, kid... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Let's rock! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Testing... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Testing... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]This Magatama is my present 
to you. I hope you like it. 
<end> 
<start>There are many more of them 
in this world. See how many 
you can find... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained the Magatama 
[2:FF03]Marogareh[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>> From the command menu ([82A9] button), 
you can view and ingest Magatama. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][2:FF04]WARNING 
This scene hasn't been 
made yet. 
<end> 
<start>The displayed text is 
the brief summary of 
this scene. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][2:FF05]The dark sky of Tokyo can be seen 
from the roof of the hospital. 
<end> 
<start>The main char opens the door, 
and sees a young woman standing 
a few feet away from him. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][2:FF01]You're the only one who came 
here? 
<end> 
<start>...You probably don't have any 
experience fending for yourself, 
do you? 
<end> 
<start>These days, everyone has it so 
easy growing up... 
At least, that's what I think. 
<end> 
<start>No one takes any initiative; 
they just sit and wait. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][2:FF01]...The world is about to be reborn. 
Everyone will have to start 
thinking for themselves. 
<end> 
<start>That's the future I envision... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][2:FF01]...It's time. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][2:FF01]You know... 
<end> 
<start>If we ever meet again... 
let's talk about other things. 
<end> 
<start>...I'll tell you all my secrets. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][2:FF05]As Yuko looks up into the sky, 
an explosion occurs. 
<end> 
<start>The shock wave hits Tokyo. 
The earth shakes, and powerful 
wind blows. 
<end> 
<start>The main character becomes 
unconscious, and the world 
is engulfed in white light... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][2:FF05]...... 
<end> 
<start>A voice can be heard. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][2:FF01]...I can see your heart, 
but inside there is nothing. 
<end> 
<start>You have no identity. 
<end> 
<start>That is unacceptable. 
You cannot create a new world 
like this. 
<end> 
<start>Go, and discover yourself. 
<end> 
<start>The end of your journey... 
There you will find the world 
of your choosing... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][2:FF05]The surroundings becomes dark 
as the voice disappears. 
<end> 
<start>From the darkness, 
the child and the old woman 
appear. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][2:FF01]So, how was the end of the 
world? Did you enjoy it? 
<end> 
<start>I sure hope so, cuz you're 
gonna live a life of torment 
in the new world. 
<end> 
<start>...But you have absolutely 
nothing, right? That's no fun. 
<end> 
<start>Here, I'll give you this. 
It'll make things more bearable. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][2:FF05]The next thing the main 
character notices, the old 
woman is standing behind him. 
<end> 
<start>He is held by the old woman 
from behind, unable to move. 
<end> 
<start>The child comes up to the 
main character and shows him 
a weird object. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][2:FF01]This will turn you into a 
demon. Aren't you happy? 
<end> 
<start>Once you're a demon, 
you can use [2:FF02]Magatama[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>There are many Magatama. 
Though they will strengthen you, 
they'll also put you in misery. 
<end> 
<start>...Okay then, here goes. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][2:FF05]The child pushes the weird 
object in the main character's 
mouth. 
<end> 
<start>Sharp pain runs through 
his body, and he falls 
unconscious... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Magatama, the essence of 
demonic power... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You have now joined the ranks of 
demons. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]My little master is always watching 
you, so don't bore him... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> There is a pillar. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Will you lower the pillar? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> It's smooth. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It looks hard. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Main character 
= debug! 
<end> 
<start>........ 
<end> 
<start>........ 
<end> 
<start>........ 
<end> 
<start>> Blah. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The pillar has already been 
lowered. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> All the pillars have been lowered. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The shrine you can see from 
the entrance is His Lordship's 
resting place. 
<end> 
<start>But, the pillars holding it up are 
guarded by the four Devas, and 
they're ultra-powerful. 
<end> 
<start>Don't go near them! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I can't believe it! 
<end> 
<start>You actually beat all four of 
the Devas! 
<end> 
<start>M-Master!! Make me your student! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Right above here! 
<end> 
<start>His Lordship is up there! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Will you open the door? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]Who doth awaken me from 
my slumber? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]............ 
<end> 
<start>...So, thou art the demon who came 
from afar...? 
<end> 
<start>I am [2:FF02]Masakado Taira[2:FF01], 
the guardian of Tokyo for 
the last thousand years. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]............ 
<end> 
<start>...Thou art [12:FF01], 
art thou not? 
<end> 
<start>The king of chaos, who hath gained 
the powers of demons despite being 
human... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][12:FF01]... 
<end> 
<start>Why hast thou come this far to 
see me? 
<end> 
<start>Lend me your power. 
<start>[7:FF07]So, thou hast come for mine 
assistance... 
<end> 
<start>............ 
<end> 
<start>But, thy Tokyo is a Tokyo my light 
cannot reach. 
<end> 
<start>I cannot set foot in thy world... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Thou art direct and to the point... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I see... Thou hast defeated 
the four Devas out of sport... 
<end> 
<start>Outstanding... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Let me ask thee a question... 
<end> 
<start>Wilt thou bring peace to Tokyo? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The [2:FF02]Lord's Sword[2:FF01] began shining 
even brighter! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I see... 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]Let me ask thee a question... 
<end> 
<start>Wilt thou bring peace to Tokyo? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Then, I shall lend thee my power. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained the Magatama 
[2:FF03]Masakados[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]............ 
<end> 
<start>Farewell. 
<end> 
<start>Be it a new world, it is still Tokyo... 
<end> 
<start>Thou art the new guardian of 
the land... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I look forward to thy world, 
conqueror. May you prove 
victorious in your war for peace. 
<end> 
<start>Now go, [12:FF01]! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Are you attempting to lower this 
pillar? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]If you plan on entering the shrine, 
overcome my ordeal! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Let us begin! 
<start>[7:FF07]Are you attempting to lower this 
pillar? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]If you plan on entering the shrine, 
you must defeat me! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Now, let us fight! 
<start>[7:FF07]Are you attempting to lower this 
pillar? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Let us find out if this battle is 
an ordeal, or divine retribution! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Prepare yourself! 
<start>[7:FF07]I was wondering what warrior was 
strong enough to enter here... Well, 
if it isn't [12:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>So, you are trying to get into 
the shrine? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Then, you should already know 
that you must defeat me, or 
the path shall never be opened! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Let us begin, [12:FF01]! 
<start>[7:FF07]> Will you leave the area? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> There is a Mystical Chest. 
Will you open it? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> You did not open 
the Mystical Chest. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 
[2:FF05][3:FF01][2:FF01] x [3:FF02]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You see a Cache Cube. 
Will you open it? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> You did not open 
the Cache Cube. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It's empty. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 
[2:FF05][3:FF01][2:FF01] x [3:FF02]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 
the Magatama [2:FF05][3:FF01][2:FF01]. 
<end>

defeat the [2:FF02]four Devas[2:FF01] in order to see 
him.

strong, so be careful...

down...

<start>[7:FF07]> Will you leave the area? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> There is a Mystical Chest. 
Will you open it? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> You did not open 
the Mystical Chest.

<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained

the Cache Cube.

here? I don't want to talk to no one!

Pest.

<start>[7:FF07]> ............ 
<end> 
<start>> You have been healed. 
<end> 
<start>No matter how many times 
you visit me, I'll heal you. 
Anything to make you go away! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]............ 
<end> 
<start>Geez, we've been having a lot of 
visitors lately! 
<end> 
<start>A human kid came in and began 
living here not too long ago. 
<end> 
<start>Well, I don't care who comes, 
as long as they don't bother me. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...What? 
<end> 
<start>You seem friendly, but I'm not in 
the mood for chatting. 
<end> 
<start>"Believe no one." 
"The truth is within you!" 
You've heard it all before, right? 
<end> 
<start>So, keep it to yourself, would you? 
<end> 
<start>...Um, I'm babbling, aren't I? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Are you planning to continue on 
ahead, mister? I wouldn't! 
<end> 
<start>No one likes to be disturbed... 
<end> 
<start>And if you try to force your way 
through, you'll run into even more 
trouble! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]OoOoHh...YoOOuuUUuuu!! 
<end> 
<start>...That's what a demon I just met 
over there said. 
<end> 
<start>But, he was much madder... 
and fiercer... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]OoOoHh...YoOOuuuuUUuuu!! 
<end> 
<start>...Oh! Did I scare you? I'm trying to 
impersonate that demon I met. 
<end> 
<start>But, it's no good! I gotta be 
madder... and fiercer...! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]When you have defeated those foes, 
you will be accepted and honored 
by us all. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]My master would like to help you 
prepare for the forthcoming battles 
by sharing a portion of his power. 
<end> 
<start>He shall release the hidden power 
of the Magatama that you have 
received. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]You, who have cast away your 
human form and, as a Fiend, 
conquered all deaths... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]You were given the body of a demon 
when you entered the Vortex World, 
<end> 
<start>[18:]and now, it is time for you to receive 
the heart of a demon, as my master 
wishes. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]You shall be born again, 
as a demon of chaos... 
harbinger of the final battle! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]May you prevail... 
Our strength, our hope... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I'm glad you're okay... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]I felt it when the evil presence 
faded away. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Were you able to get 
the [2:FF02]Yahirono Himorogi[2:FF01]? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You came back... 
I knew I could count on you. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]I felt it when the evil presence 
faded away. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Does that mean you have 
the [2:FF02]Yahirono Himorogi[2:FF01]? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Oh... so the Magatsuhi was used up 
already. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Then, you don't mind me 
keeping this, do you? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Oh... so the Magatsuhi was used up 
already. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Can I have it then, 
since you have no use for it? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]This brings me one step closer 
to creating my world... 
<end> 
<start>My god will surely teach me 
the Reason now... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Freedom is the cliff 
that overlooks the abyss, 
the valley of the shadow of death. 
<end> 
<start>The grave awaits even the victor 
at the end of the road. 
<end> 
<start>Show me your heart... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Fool who bears the name Freedom! 
<end> 
<start>Because of your name, 
you will carry the burden of 
plague, pain, and ridicule. 
<end> 
<start>Do you fear the suffering 
and humiliation? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Fool who bears the name Freedom! 
<end> 
<start>Because of your name, 
you will live a life of betrayal, 
rejection, and defeat. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Do you fear the deceit, 
the torment? 
<end> 
<start>Yes, I do. 
<start>[7:FF07]Go! And see the world 
with your own eyes! 
<end> 
<start>There are forces vying for creation. 
Without judging their Reasons, 
your world will not come to be. 
<end> 
<start>Side with them, 
or side against them. 
Only then will your world be born. 
<end> 
<start>Remember that you... 
Lo! A new force is about to 
emerge in Ikebukuro! 
<end> 
<start>I, too, will become a force, 
with this woman. 
<end> 
<start>...Remember that you are what is 
right. That is my truth. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]...Aradia... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]You still won't give me 
the Reason...? 
<end> 
<start>[18:]What am I missing...? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]...I think it's time for me to go. 
Staying here won't do me any good. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]I should see for myself 
what kind of world 
others are trying to create. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Thank you, [12:FF01]. 
I'll see you again sometime. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Little lamb that struggled through 
darkness and clung to life, 
you have done well until now. 
<end> 
<start>...I watched as you prevailed 
over many adversaries. 
<end> 
<start>I am the Trumpeter... 
It is I who will announce 
the end of time. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I have come to see if you are 
worthy... 
<end> 
<start>...of entering the final battle, 
where my trumpet will sound. 
<end> 
<start>Show me your incomparable 
strength! ...Let me see 
the raging heart of a demon! 
<end> 
<start>Seize the last candelabrum from 
my hand! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][13:FF01], you have been 
branded with our master's seal... 
<end> 
<start>You must take the last candelabrum 
to the bottom of the abyss and meet 
our master there. 
<end> 
<start>That is, of course, if you can 
defeat me... the last of the Fiends. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Seize the last candelabrum from 
my hand! 
<end> 
<start>For the future of all demons 
of chaos!! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 
the [2:FF02]Candelabrum of Godliness[2:FF01].

<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...Who's there!? 
<start>[7:FF07]...... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Wait a minute... 
Aren't you the kid I met at the park? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]What happened to you...? 
<end> 
<start>I'm stronger now. 
<start>[7:FF07]...... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]...You're not joking, are you? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]...I see. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Well, at least you still think 
like a human... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]...So, what the hell is going on? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]All of a sudden, 
I was blinded by a bright light, 
and the next thing I knew, 
I was here in this room. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]I took a quick look around, 
and it looks like I'm in a hospital... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Since you're here too, 
does that mean this is 
Shinjuku Medical Center? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]...Anyways. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]As much as I want to know 
what's going on out there, 
I don't think it's safe for me 
to walk around. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Damn... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]I might have to seriously consider 
the possibility. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]It's hard to believe, but... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]If this is Shinjuku Medical Center, 
then I can't just rule it out. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]The Conception... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]...could have occurred for real. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]By the way, have you come across 
any yet? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Hm... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]It wasn't my imagination, then. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Demons. 
...They're all around here. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]I never thought I'd actually 
live to see one... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Well, they're definitely not human. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]My guess is that they're... demons. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]My strange experience... 
your new look... 
and these weird creatures... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]I don't think the police 
will be able to help us here. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I've seen this barrel-like object 
somewhere before... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]If my memory serves me right, 
it belongs to a man named Hikawa. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]He must have something to do 
with all this. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]If you can... 
<end> 
<start>Oh yeah, take this. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF10]> You obtained an [2:FF05]annex gate pass[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>(message for checking bug) 
<end> 
<start>I found this when I entered 
the hospital. 
You should be able to access 
the annex with it. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]...Standing here talking 
won't get us anywhere. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]If you're strong enough to fight 
those demons, then will you gather 
information for me? 
<end> 
<start>[18:]I tried talking to what looked like 
a ghost, but I didn't have much luck. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]What's happened to the world...? 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Are there are other humans 
out there...? 
<end> 
<start>[18:]We can only learn the answers 
to these questions by finding 
somebody else. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]...I wish I could do it myself, 
but I don't think I'd last very long 
against those demons. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Besides, I'd like to spend some time 
studying this object. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]I'm counting on you. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Maybe you should try and get out 
of this hospital. 
...Good luck. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...What's the matter? 
You wanna ask me something? 
<end> 
<start>Ask Hijiri... 
<start>What happened? 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Don't worry about me. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]I know I'll only slow you down 
if I go with you. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]...Hey, I don't plan on dying here, 
you know. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]That's why I'm checking 
this thing out. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]...So, go. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Well, I'm not exactly sure yet... 
<end> 
<start>But, it reminds me of something 
Buddhists use... 
<end> 
<start>They have these rotating 
bookshelves that they store 
scriptures in. 
<end> 
<start>Supposedly, if you rotate one 
all the way around, you'll receive 
a blessing, just as you would 
by reading the scriptures. 
<end> 
<start>...It looks like this thing can 
keep record of your progress. 
Go ahead and try it. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> There is a temple. 
<end> 
<start>Have [2:FF02]Bishamon's thing[2:FF01]. 
<start>[7:FF07]> The [2:FF02]Kimon Stone[2:FF01] began to shine. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The seal has been broken. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Will you enter? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> The temple is sealed with a powerful 
spell. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> No one is here. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]So, it is you, [12:FF01], 
who has broken my seal! 
<end> 
<start>I have heard rumors of you. 
<end> 
<start>............ 
<end> 
<start>But, I sense something different 
about you... 
<end> 
<start>You are not an ordinary demon, 
are you? 
<end> 
<start>That's right. 
<start>Sure. 
<start>[7:FF07]Is that right? 
<end> 
<start>Then, show me what power 
you possess!! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You are humble. Very well. 
<end> 
<start>So, how about it, [12:FF01]? 
Will you fight me? 
<end> 
<start>There is no need to hold back! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Do you accept Bishamon's 
challenge? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I guarded the Tokyo of old with 
my comrades. 
<end> 
<start>I will show you my power! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]What a bore... 
<end> 
<start>Begone! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Now, do you feel like fighting me? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...Hmmm! 
<end> 
<start>Just as he said, your powers are 
far greater than what I have 
imagined. 
<end> 
<start>Now, like my comrades, I must lend 
my powers to him. 
<end> 
<start>I would like to fight you again, 
but... 
<end> 
<start>...I must be going. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]............ 
<end> 
<start>Take this. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained the Magatama 
[2:FF03]Gundari[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]If you have enough power to obtain 
all of these... 
<end> 
<start>Then, you will be able to set foot 
into the world I am going to. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]If that should happen... then we shall 
meet again! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Bishamon disappeared. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Will you leave the area? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> There is a Mystical Chest. 
Will you open it? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> You did not open 
the Mystical Chest. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 
[2:FF05][3:FF01][2:FF01] x [3:FF02]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You see a Cache Cube. 
Will you open it? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> You did not open 
the Cache Cube. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It's empty. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 
[2:FF05][3:FF01][2:FF01] x [3:FF02]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 
the Magatama [2:FF05][3:FF01][2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 
[2:FF05][3:FF01] Macca[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It's a trap. 
<end> 
<start>> Your party took damage. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It's empty. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> [3:FF03] found something. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]............ 
> You obtained 
[2:FF05][3:FF01][2:FF01] x [3:FF02]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It can't be used here. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The light effect wore off. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The repel effect wore off. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The attract effect wore off. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The levitation effect wore off. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Select a floor. 
<end> 
<start>[3:FF01][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF02][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF03][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF04][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF05][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF06][80EA] 
<start>[7:FF07]> Message Test 
Now, for the basics... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Message Test 
Next are the choices. 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]Yes, you say? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]No, you say? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]This subway leads to Yoyogi Park. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Yoyogi's the place where a bunch of 
demonstrators died, right? 
<end> 
<start>That's scary!! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Hey you!! How many times do I have 
to tell you? 
<end> 
<start>Stay behind the white line! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]There still seems to be demons 
running around Yoyogi. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Are you going to Yoyogi Park to 
participate in the demonstration? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Violence cannot be forgiven!! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]We are demonstrators that work 
hard to make a better city!! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Apathy is not the answer! We must 
fight for what we believe in!! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]What the heck?! What's up with all 
these souls? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]For a future without discrimination! 
For a city our children can play in!! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Yoyogi Park is just beyond the exit. 
<end> 
<start>Now, let's join together and fight for 
our beliefs!! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Protect our children from 
the temptations of juvenile 
delinquency!! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I'll fight it, even if I'm the only one 
doing it! 
<end> 
<start>I demand that the government not 
not censor my pornography! 
<end> 
<start>...Oops. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Will you leave the area? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> There is a Mystical Chest. 
Will you open it? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> You did not open 
the Mystical Chest. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 
[2:FF05][3:FF01][2:FF01] x [3:FF02]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You see a Cache Cube. 
Will you open it? 
<end> 
<start>Yes.

the Magatama [2:FF05][3:FF01][2:FF01].

<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 
[2:FF05][3:FF01] Macca[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It's a trap. 
<end> 
<start>> Your party took damage. 
<end>

<start>[3:FF04][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF05][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF06][80EA] 
<start>[7:FF07]> There is no response from 
the Manikin. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]J-J-Just awhile back, Sakahagi... 
went to Yoyogi... 
<end> 
<start>Th-Th-Thank goodness it was 
dark... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]A vicious-looking Manikin passed 
by a short while back. 
<end> 
<start>After that, a female human passed 
by. 
<end> 
<start>It's usually quiet here, but... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]This is a rather quiet place, 
compared to Tokyo in general. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Yoyogi Park is the place that 
all the fairies are guarding. 
<end> 
<start>That vicious Manikin won't be able 
to do anything just by himself. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]That lady who was heading to 
Yoyogi Park was lookin' fiiiiiine! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]You are here, at last... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]We have long awaited this moment, 
in the everlasting flow of Amala. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]You have retrieved all of 
the candelabra, and triumphed over 
the mightiest warrior of light. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]You are the demon that we have 
been waiting for. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Do you hear it, [12:FF01]? 
<end> 
<start>All of the demons are celebrating 
the birth of the new demon of 
darkness, 
<end> 
<start>hoping that you and the fallen angel 
will break the chains, 
and defeat the Absolute One... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]There is no turning back... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]We, the ones cast into darkness, 
shall face those that live in 
the light... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]The final battle is about to begin. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]But first, you must return to your 
world and increase your strength... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]by defeating the humans who are 
vying for control of creation, 
and Kagutsuchi, the source of 
creation. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]A man who envisions a world 
of silence... 
Ahriman, god of the void, 
lends him strength. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]A young woman who values power 
above all else... 
The god Baal Avatar has descended 
upon her. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]A young man yearning to live 
in solitude... 
His strength comes from Noah, 
the wandering god. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]And Kagutsuchi, the light that 
watches over the Vortex World 
as well as creation... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]It's nice to have visitors, 
but this is ridiculous... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]You too, huh? 
You should've thought twice 
before coming here. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]They all come for Magatsuhi, 
but then they find out that 
it's already mine. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]There was a girl who showed up 
not long before you. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Yeah, I taught her a lesson... 
a painful one. Hehehe... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Didn't I tell you before? 
I won't be used by demons. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]With all my Magatsuhi, 
I'll be the one using them. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Not just any demons... 
Even the strong ones. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]That skin of yours will make 
a nice coat! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained the [2:FF02]Yahirono Himorogi[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>> However, the power of Magatsuhi 
seemed to be absent from it... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...You've withstood the attacks of 
the Fiends, and now you stand here 
before me. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]For this feat, I shall grant you 
audience. 
<end> 
<start>Come forward. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...I am chief among those who fell 
from heaven. 
<end> 
<start>With the angel of darkness, 
I lead the demons of chaos. 
<end> 
<start>...I am Beelzebub, ruler of death 
and warden of souls. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]So you're [13:FF01], 
Lord Lucifer's favorite... 
<end> 
<start>I've heard about you. 
<end> 
<start>With the power given to you by 
Lord Lucifer, you are trying to 
create a new demon, correct? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...What, you didn't know? 
That's what the candelabra are for. 
<end> 
<start>When all the candelabra have been 
returned to their rightful places, 
a new demon of chaos will be born... 
<end> 
<start>I have no idea how he talked you 
into collecting them, but... 
I've got to say, you're quite gullible. 
<end> 
<start>Remember this, 
[13:FF01]... 
<end> 
<start>The demons of chaos are all waiting 
for that moment... 
<end> 
<start>...the moment when the new demon 
is born, and Lord Lucifer makes 
his final decision... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The army of chaos will rise 
at Lord Lucifer's command. 
<end> 
<start>To bring about that glorious event, 
I would gladly assist you. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]But, you must first demonstrate that 
you are worthy of my help... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]My true form is more suitable 
for this test... 
<start>[7:FF07]Now, prove your strength to me!! 
<end> 
<start>Unleash the demonic power given 
to you by Lord Lucifer!! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> A voice echoes through the hall... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...You did not disappoint me, 
[13:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>Your power is indeed a source 
of hope for chaos... 
<end> 
<start>When we meet again, 
I'll fulfill my promise... 
<end> 
<start>...I shall see you at the Cathedral 
of Shadows... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The voice could no longer 
be heard... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]From chaos comes strength. 
From strength comes demon. 
<end> 
<start>Demon is strength. 
Strength is demon. 
<end> 
<start>Bow down before me. 
<end> 
<start>I shall lead you demons, 
the kingdom of chaos, 
for all eternity... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][80EA]  
<start>[7:FF04][2:FF03]Oooohhh...[2:FF01] 
<start>[7:FF04][2:FF03]Heaven and earth tremble[2:FF01] 
<start>[7:FF04][2:FF03]when the almighty[2:FF01] 
<start>[7:FF04][2:FF03]descends from above;[2:FF01] 
<start>[7:FF04][2:FF03]god's coming echoes[2:FF01] 
<start>[7:FF04][2:FF03]across the land...[2:FF01] 
<start>[7:FF07]Welcome, [13:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>I am Gozu-Tennoh. 
As the head of the Mantra, 
I lead the demons that gather here. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I was truly impressed by your battle. 
<end> 
<start>The emergence of a new, 
mighty demon... 
It is remarkable indeed. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]But first, let me reward you. 
Please accept this gift. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I shall share some of my Magatsuhi 
with you. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You received power from 
Gozu-Tennoh. 
<end> 
<start>> You can now employ 
2 additional demons. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Hahahaha! Do you feel the power 
coursing through your body? 
<end> 
<start>If you choose to serve me, 
I shall grant you 
even greater power... 
<end> 
<start>Joining the Mantra doesn't seem 
like a bad idea, does it? 
What say you? 
<end> 
<start>I'm at your service. 
<start>[7:FF07]Hahahaha!! Very well, then! 
<end> 
<start>I have some work for our 
new member of the Mantra. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Hm... Hahaha... Hahahahaha!! 
<end> 
<start>Not enough Magatsuhi to sate 
your thirst? 
You are quite a greedy one. 
<end> 
<start>Insatiable greed is a demon's virtue, 
however. 
<end> 
<start>I am sure you will grow stronger 
without my guidance. 
<end> 
<start>...But, do not dare to oppose me. 
If you do... 
You can imagine the consequences. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Hmm... Indecisive, are you? 
<end> 
<start>If you serve me, 
I can release your innate power. 
<end> 
<start>...I can see that you are 
interested in the Mantra, 
but not totally convinced. 
<end> 
<start>If that is the case... 
you may observe us first, 
and then decide. 
<end> 
<start>Although, I believe your destiny 
is to fight alongside us. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Now... As you may already know, 
our enemy is the Assembly of Nihilo. 
<end> 
<start>They are threatening us 
with their plot to bring 
the world to a halt. 
<end> 
<start>We can no longer overlook 
their madness. 
<end> 
<start>I have made the decision. 
<end> 
<start>We, the Mantra, will wage war 
on Nihilo, and obliterate them! 
<end> 
<start>I have already ordered my soldiers 
to attack their headquarters 
in Ginza. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]If you consider yourself a Mantra, 
make haste and go to Ginza. 
Crush those who pose a threat 
to the world! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]If you call yourself a demon, 
make haste and go to Ginza. 
Crush those who pose a threat 
to the world! 
<end> 
<start>I am Gozu-Tennoh, 
the one who will rule 
the kingdom of chaos... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF04]...It's so quiet... Too quiet... 
<end> 
<start>...I see, the stillness has come 
for me... 
<end> 
<start>Wielder of strength... 
Champion of want... 
mold the world to your liking. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]It is no longer of my concern... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Magatama transfer message 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained the [2:FF02]Earthstone[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Hmmmmmm!! 
<end> 
<start>This is Master Loki's room. 
<end> 
<start>Dirty punks like you go over there!! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Hmmmmmmmmm!! You!! 
<end> 
<start>What were you doing while I was 
gone!? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Hmmmmmmmmmmmm!! 
It's time for you to die!! 
<start>[7:FF07]Who the hell are you? 
<end> 
<start>Whaddya want in here? 
Did you come in for a drink? 
<end> 
<start>Sorry kid, but I don't think 
they serve milk or juice boxes 
in this place. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Hey! 
<end> 
<start>That's my room! Don't even think of 
touching it! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Huh? 
<end> 
<start>Is there a [2:FF02]Bill[2:FF01] in my room? 
<end> 
<start>Bill, as in human money? 
<end> 
<start>It might, it might not... 
Heheheh... 
<end> 
<start>You want a Bill? 
<end> 
<start>Bill me. 
<start>[7:FF07]I see, then you have no business 
here. Take a hike, junior. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You wanna cut a deal? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]20,000,000 Macca. Now, whether 
there's a Bill in my room or not, 
that's a different question. 
<end> 
<start>Whaddya think? 
Will you pay me 20,000,000 Macca? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Heheheh... Well, of course. 
<end> 
<start>Then, there's nothing to talk about. 
Go home. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]So, have you decided to pay me 
20,000,000 Macca? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...You need the money first before 
you can say that! 
<end> 
<start>I don't have time to deal with bums. 
Go home. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]......!! 
<end> 
<start>You actually came up with the cash... 
Well, you did your end. 
<end> 
<start>...Sometimes, telling the truth has 
its advantages. Go ahead, it's yours. 
<end> 
<start>You can live in it, burn it, 
do whatever you want with it. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The deal's done. 
That room's yours. 
<end> 
<start>You can live in it, burn it, 
do whatever you want with it. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]What the--!  
<end> 
<start>Someone jacked up my room! 
Who did this!? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The door is locked. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Flag corner. 
<end> 
<start>What flag will you turn on? 
<end> 
<start>Looking for 1. 
<start>[7:FF07]............ 
<end> 
<start>Oh... You again. 
<end> 
<start>What? 
The [2:FF02]Star Key[2:FF01]...? 
<end> 
<start>Heheheh... 
It's in my stomach... As liquor, 
of course. 
<end> 
<start>I sold it to a curious Manikin. 
<end> 
<start>...I needed the money, since 
my room was raided. 
<end> 
<start>...Know what I mean? Heheheh... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]............ 
<end> 
<start>Talk to that Manikin collector 
if you want the [2:FF02]Star Key[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>Let me be. I want some time alone. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The attack on the Nihilo by 
the Mantra is just the beginning of 
the creation. 
<end> 
<start>Will it be a bright future...? 
Or will it remain chaotic...? 
Time will tell... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The Manikins went to Asakusa, 
I hear. 
<end> 
<start>With Futomimi as their leader, 
the city's slowly coming back to life. 
<end> 
<start>But, it's times like these when 
the unexpected occurs. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Futomimi predicts the future 
at Mifunashiro regularly and 
leads the Manikins accordingly. 
<end> 
<start>...But what does he do in case of 
a bad prediction? 
<end> 
<start>Maybe something like his death... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The Assembly of Nihilo... 
Hikawa's finally begun to move. 
<end> 
<start>I hear he's after the large amount of 
Magatsuhi at the [2:FF02]Diet Building[2:FF01]... 
<end> 
<start>It's ironic that a human is using 
demons to his bidding, rather than 
the other way around. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]There's a tower coming from 
Kagutsuchi to the Obelisk. 
<end> 
<start>It's like Kagutsuchi's saying to 
come on up. 
<end> 
<start>Shijima, Yosuga, Musubi... 
Which Reason will guide Tokyo? 
<end> 
<start>Hikawa, [12:FF04],  
[12:FF03]... 
Who'll become Tokyo's conqueror? 
<end> 
<start>...The moment of fate is near. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The Assembly of Nihilo's rule is 
way too stiff! 
<end> 
<start>...But, thanks to that, the demons 
here don't cause any real trouble. 
<end> 
<start>Geez, those Mantra sure know 
how to mess things up! 
<end> 
<start>I was just getting used to not having 
demons fight each other over here... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The Nihilo demons aren't 
coming back! 
<end> 
<start>I don't know what they're up to, 
but it'll get ugly if there's 
too much drama between demons. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]What the hell is 
the Assembly of Nihilo doing!? 
<end> 
<start>I hear this [12:FF03] guy is 
searching like mad for Magatsuhi. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]............ 
<end> 
<start>It seems that [12:FF03] has 
summoned a god for his Reason, 
Musubi. 
<end> 
<start>At this rate, a world of Musubi 
will be created. 
<end> 
<start>What is the Assembly of Nihilo 
thinking!? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Shijima is a still world that isn't 
controlled by emotions. 
<end> 
<start>You become one with the universe, 
and there's no need to suffer. 
<end> 
<start>...It fits a person who keeps his cool, 
like me. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The Assembly of Nihilo has a human 
they call the[2:FF02]Maiden[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>She and the Commander are 
the ones holding Nihilo together. 
<end> 
<start>But, that's not saying much. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The Nightmare System... 
The system that defeated 
Gozu-Tennoh... 
<end> 
<start>I hear that the Maiden has 
something to do with it. 
<end> 
<start>She's messing up everything. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The Nightmare System has stopped. 
<end> 
<start>The Assembly of Nihilo now needs 
to think of another way to collect 
Magatsuhi. 
<end> 
<start>...But, knowing Commander Hikawa, 
he probably already has something 
up his sleeve. 
<end> 
<start>I sure hope he knows what 
he's doing. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]We gotta look out for the Yosuga, 
the group that took over 
the Mantra's headquarters. 
<end> 
<start>The leader is this human girl named 
[12:FF04], and she's looking 
for Magatsuhi. 
<end> 
<start>If you ask me, she's just another 
power hungry jerk. 
<end> 
<start>Yosuga plans to make new Tokyo 
with only the best. 
<end> 
<start>It's going to be a refined 
new world where the weak don't 
exist. 
<end> 
<start>I think it's a pretty rotten idea, 
personally. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The Mantra's attack will fail. 
I'm sure of it. 
<end> 
<start>The Assembly of Nihilo's got brains, 
unlike that other band of ruffians. 
<end> 
<start>Besides, their Commander probably 
has everything already calculated 
out! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Kabukicho Prison is where 
the Mantra get their Magatsuhi. 
It's their lifeline, so to speak. 
<end> 
<start>So if that goes down, so does 
the Mantra's headquarters. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]There is a ton of Magatsuhi in 
the Amala Network. 
<end> 
<start>Nihilo used to be the only ones 
that utilized the Magatsuhi in 
the Network, but I hear that recently 
a human's been hiding out inside. 
<end> 
<start>He probably became enchanted with 
Magatsuhi as he kept accessing 
those terminals. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I hear there's a bunch of Magatsuhi 
lying dormant at Mifunashiro. 
<end> 
<start>What's Futomimi planning on using 
it for? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Musubi believes in total individuality. 
<end> 
<start>Their world is one where you can do 
anything you want without ever 
having to meddle with anyone else. 
<end> 
<start>What do you think of that? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The flames of the [2:FF02]Candelabrum 
of Sovereignty[2:FF01] are flickering wildly... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You can feel the presence of 
a terrifying demon... 
<end> 
<start>> Will you stay here? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> Are you sure? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF02]> ............ 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It looks like you'll be able to 
get away. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It looks like you won't be able to 
escape... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I know you have a candelabrum! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The flames of the candelabrum 
are burning passionately! 
You won't escape! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Will you leave the area? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> There is a Mystical Chest. 
Will you open it? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> You did not open 
the Mystical Chest. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 
[2:FF05][3:FF01][2:FF01] x [3:FF02]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You see a Cache Cube. 
Will you open it? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> You did not open 
the Cache Cube. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It's empty. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 
[2:FF05][3:FF01][2:FF01] x [3:FF02]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 
the Magatama [2:FF05][3:FF01][2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 
[2:FF05][3:FF01] Macca[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It's a trap. 
<end> 
<start>> Your party took damage. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It's empty. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> [3:FF03] found something. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]............ 
> You obtained 
[2:FF05][3:FF01][2:FF01] x [3:FF02]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It can't be used here. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The light effect wore off. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The repel effect wore off. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The attract effect wore off. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The levitation effect wore off. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Select a floor. 
<end> 
<start>[3:FF01][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF02][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF03][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF04][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF05][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF06][80EA] 
<start>[7:FF07]Hey! 
<end> 
<start>That's [2:FF02]my room[2:FF01]. Don't even think of 
touching it! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The door is locked from 
the other side. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The door is locked. 
<end> 
<start>> Will you unlock it? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> The door is now unlocked. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]This is Ginza, the city under the rule 
of the [2:FF02]Assembly of Nihilo[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Make sure you don't make any 
trouble here. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Soon, our world shall come... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Ahriman has arrived! 
<end> 
<start>Now, all we need to do to create 
the world of Shijima is obtain power 
from Kagutsuchi! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Did you know? 
<end> 
<start>People say that Loki owns a bunch 
of different things. He's at 
Nyx's Lounge. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Did you know? 
<end> 
<start>I hear that a thief snuck into 
Loki's room! Very unloki... I mean, 
unlucky! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Did you know? 
<end> 
<start>I hear that the Assembly of Nihilo 
has a secret weapon. Guess it's not 
a secret anymore... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Did you hear? 
<end> 
<start>They say there's a reason why 
the Nihilo demons aren't coming 
back. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Did ya hear? 
<end> 
<start>They're sayin' there's a guy diggin' 
a tunnel at Yurakucho. 
<end> 
<start>I doubt there's any relation to what 
Hikawa's doin', though. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]We protect our Commander and 
the Maiden. 
<end> 
<start>If the time arises, we are willing to 
sacrifice our lives for them! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]A world of silence... 
<end> 
<start>A painless world because emotions 
do not control it. 
<end> 
<start>The only ones that can live there 
are beings that have spiritually 
surpassed humans and demons... 
<end> 
<start>That's right... We will all become 
gods! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You can't exclude the power of 
Magatsuhi in creating the world. 
<end> 
<start>The Assembly of Nihilo is using 
terminals to suck Magatsuhi 
from the Amala Network. 
<end> 
<start>The Commander is a clever one... 
Ha ha ha! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Ha ha ha... 
<end> 
<start>The Assembly of Nihilo has an ace 
up their sleeve. 
<end> 
<start>The Commander is such a bright 
man! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Ha! 
<end> 
<start>Commander Hikawa is the supreme 
ruler of the battle for creation. 
<end> 
<start>We may be a late entry, but that's 
because we were preparing for 
an incredible god. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Finally, Ahriman, the god of Shijima, 
has descended upon us! 
<end> 
<start>Commander Hikawa is the supreme 
ruler of the battle for creation. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Inexcusable! 
<end> 
<start>Those guys hanging around in 
Nyx's Lounge are a bunch of 
good-for-nothings. 
<end> 
<start>"Full of information" my ass! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The world belongs to the Assembly 
of Nihilo... 
<end> 
<start>...I mean, Shijima. It will be shrouded 
in silence. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]*whisper* Let me tell ya something... 
<end> 
<start>There's a door leading to the back 
room of Nyx's Lounge. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]*whisper* Let me tell ya something... 
Very hush-hush! 
<end> 
<start>There's a tunnel at Yurakucho 
Station that leads to [2:FF02]Nagatacho[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]*whisper* Let me tell ya something... 
Mum's the word! 
<end> 
<start>The Tower of Kagutsuchi can be 
accessed from the Obelisk... 
Remember, mum's the word! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The Assembly of Nihilo has a human 
they call the[2:FF02]Maiden[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>She and the Commander are 
the ones holding Nihilo together. 
<end> 
<start>But, that's not saying much. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]We, the Assembly of Nihilo, have 
a [2:FF02]human Commander[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>He may be human, but he is very 
intelligent and dependable. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Commander Hikawa is just so 
clever! 
<end> 
<start>Even if our headquarters was 
attacked, even if we lost 
the Nightmare System... 
<end> 
<start>He'd still be victorious! 
He conceives plans as if he knows 
what events will take place. 
<end> 
<start>He may be human, but he's 
a brilliant strategist. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Why did Commander Hikawa fall 
behind in conceiving his Reason? 
<end> 
<start>He was probably checking out 
the other Reasons first... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The Assembly of Nihilo desires  
a [2:FF02]world of stillness[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>It is a world without pain, 
because it is not controlled by 
emotion. 
<end> 
<start>...It is far different from the state of 
chaos that Tokyo is in right now. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]We've finally found it... 
Enough Magatsuhi needed for 
the creation of the new world... 
<end> 
<start>Now, we can create our ideal world 
of stillness! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The Reason of Shijima will prevail! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Oh? 
<end> 
<start>Hey kid. What're you doing in 
a place like this? 
<end> 
<start>I haven't seen you around before. 
Did you come to check out 
the Assembly of Nihilo? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]I see... That's good. 
<end> 
<start>It's best not to bother with all this 
"creation" business. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...I knew it. 
<end> 
<start>You probably have something for 
that Maiden, right? 
<end> 
<start>...The Nihilo base of operations is 
right outside of Ginza. 
<end> 
<start>I'd tell you not to try it, but 
boys love risking their necks for 
girls. 
<end> 
<start>If it doesn't work out, come talk to 
me again. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]What? You couldn't get inside 
the base? 
<end> 
<start>Ha! 
I didn't think you'd actually be 
crazy enough to try and go there! 
<end> 
<start>...Is there a reason why you need to 
infiltrate the Assembly of Nihilo? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]............ 
<end> 
<start>I see... 
<end> 
<start>Then, let me tell you something. 
<end> 
<start>Go see [2:FF02]Gozu-Tennoh[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>Gozu-Tennoh is the leader of 
the demons in [2:FF02]Ikeburo[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>He's no friend of the Nihilo, so he 
might help you out. 
<end> 
<start>You can get to Ikebukuro from 
the [2:FF02]Great Underpass of Ginza[2:FF01], 
just across the bridge from here. 
<end> 
<start>Good luck... You're gonna need it. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Gozu-Tennoh is the leader of 
the demons in Ikeburo. 
<end> 
<start>You can get to Ikebukuro from 
the Great Underpass of Ginza, which 
is across the bridge from here. 
<end> 
<start>I wish you the best of luck. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Nihilo's rule is way too 
heavy-handed! 
<end> 
<start>But, if it weren't for that, 
the demons would be at each 
other's throats. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]There's a north wing and a west 
wing here in Ginza. They intersect 
at the fountain. 
<end> 
<start>They have different exits, too. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The Nihilo demons haven't come 
back at all since they left for 
the headquarters. 
<end> 
<start>What happened? What are they 
up to? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Those Nihilo demons came back 
all of a sudden! 
<end> 
<start>Something happened! They must've 
been doing something! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The Nihilo demons headed for 
the tower that came down from 
Kagutsuchi. 
<end> 
<start>It's so quiet... 
<end> 
<start>Now, this is what I call stillness. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Nihilo's base is southwest of 
Ginza... in [2:FF02]Shiodome[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The Nihilo demons are on the other 
side of the railroad tracks... 
<end> 
<start>I saw them near [2:FF02]Yurakucho Station[2:FF01], 
past the Tokyo Tower! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]How are the Nihilo demons? 
They doing okay? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Excuse me. 
<end> 
<start>Do you know about [2:FF02]Rag's Jewelry[2:FF01], 
the shop that will trade gems for 
items? 
<end> 
<start>The merchandise changes every 
time I go in there. It's so hard to 
choose! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The Cathedral of Shadows devised 
a new type of fusion, called 
[2:FF02]sacrificial fusion[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>...Hold on now, don't expect me to 
become a sacrifice! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Man, the Cathedral of Shadows is 
one great place. 
<end> 
<start>[2:FF02]Sacrificial fusion[2:FF01]... 
[2:FF02]The Demonic Compendium[2:FF01]... 
It's got it all. 
<end> 
<start>...Well, I can't use anything there, 
though. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Man, the Cathedral of Shadows is 
one great place. 
<end> 
<start>[2:FF02]Sacrificial fusion[2:FF01]... 
[2:FF02]The Demonic Compendium[2:FF01]... 
<end> 
<start>But... there's a rumor that they're 
hiding [2:FF02]something even better[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]...Hey, kid. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]I had a feeling that 
I'd see you again. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]And I was right... 
Looks like I hit the jackpot. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]I'm not here to explain 
all the details, 
<end> 
<start>[18:]but I bet you've already got 
some idea. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]That old geezer intends for 
the Fiends to kill each other off... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Why? Who knows...? 
But, you're not dumb enough 
to play into his hand, are you? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Then, get out of here. 
...And don't look back. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]That's your only option. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]...Am I right, kid? 
<end> 
<start>Yeah... 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Hm, I'm surprised that you'd agree. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]...It's no playground around here. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Take my advice and lay low. 
Otherwise... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]*sigh* You're asking for it, kid. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Okay. Take one step beyond 
this point, and... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Bang! ...Got it? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Let's rock! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Playtime's over. Now... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF06][18:]Let's rock! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Now, turn around and go home. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Well, look who we have here... 
[12:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Don't tell me you came to save me. 
You're way too late. 
<end> 
<start>Talk back. 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]What are you pissed off for? 
It's not like you went 
out of your way to help me. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]It's obvious I can't count on you 
or Ms. [11:FF02] anymore. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]I don't want your apology. 
It won't change anything. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]It's obvious I can't count on you 
or Ms. [11:FF02] anymore. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]You're leaving? Sure, go ahead. 
I didn't expect anything from you 
anyway. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]It's obvious I can't count on you 
or Ms. [11:FF02] anymore. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]No one's gonna help me 
in this world... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]I'll have to survive on my own. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]When this world was created... 
I heard a voice that told me 
to search for the truth. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]At the time, I didn't know 
what that meant... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]But, while I was locked up 
in this room, I came to realize. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Truth isn't something other people 
can give you; you have to find it 
within yourself. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]And I opened the way 
without anybody's help. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]The Amala Network... 
What I'm looking for is in there. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]The great power that'll lead me 
to the truth... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]It's calling me... 
<end>

restoring Asakusa?

a rowdy group.

<start>...Some of them'll attack just for 
talking to them!

<start>[7:FF07]The Mantra left Ikebukuro in 
a giant mass. 
<end> 
<start>...The Assembly of Nihilo's gonna 
get their asses handed to them!

<start>[7:FF07]Look at that... The Mantra are in 
shambles.

the Assembly of Nihilo!

<start>[7:FF07]Geez... Guess Ikebukuro IS busy, 
after all!

Magatsuhi out of the Manikins.

<start>It's a huge torture chamber!

[2:FF02]Kabukicho Prison[2:FF01]...

It's all in the past, now.

so greedy...

<start>I should've bought a couple of 
[2:FF02]Float Balls[2:FF01]... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Now that Gozu-Tennoh is gone, 
the prison is just a slum for 
the ex-members of the Mantra. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I saw an important-looking Manikin 
leading a bunch of other Manikins 
out! 
<end> 
<start>Who is he?! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I hear Futomimi--that Manikin who 
was held prisoner in Kabukicho-- 
can predict the future. 
<end> 
<start>Looks like he's at Mifunashiro 
now. I wonder if he could tell me 
MY future... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Hey, there's the Emperor in 
Kabukicho now. 
<end> 
<start>...Damn, it's cold. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You're the one who beat 
the Emperor, huh? 
<end> 
<start>That was me alright! 
<start>[7:FF07]Mizuchi... The Emperor... 
All the demons that become 
the boss of Kabukicho fall prey 
to you.

<start>You're the real 
'Emperor of Kabukicho'!

<start>[7:FF07]You don't have to hide it. 
I know. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Hey, you! You d-don't plan to take 
that h-highway, d-do you?

<start>You should quit while you can!

around there lately...

I'm the Manikin that collects 
all sorts of junk. 
<end> 
<start>I finally opened my own shop! 
<end> 
<start>Take your time and look around. 
Since you helped me out before, 
I'll sell to you at wholesale.

before, hee ho.

of redemption.

<start>I cannot turn a blind eye to 
the fallen angel's abominable plan... 
to foster the birth of a new demon.

the Labyrinth of Amala is just

<end> 
<start>[7:FF06]Interesting... 
So, you found your way here. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF06]I guess the members of Mantra 
aren't as thick as I thought... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF06]Now, this is a big surprise. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]You're that boy from the hospital, 
correct? 
I'm amazed that you're still alive. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]And judging by your appearance... 
you've gained considerable power. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF06][18:]Why have you come here? 
<end> 
<start>[18:]...Are you here to see me? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF06][18:]...I see. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Even though I nearly killed you, 
you've tracked me down to obtain 
the answers you seek. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF06][18:]Then, are you here to steal 
our Magatsuhi, like the Mantra? 
<end> 
<start>[18:]No... That's not it. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]But, I have an idea why you're 
really here. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF06]...Very well. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]I commend you for reaching 
this place on your own. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]If it is truth that you seek, 
then I will reveal everything... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]...all there is to know of this world. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF06][18:]Take a look at this device... 
Its function is to collect 
the Magatsuhi. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]You must have seen one like it 
on the upper level. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF06][18:]Do you know why Magatsuhi exists? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF06][18:]No, not simply for demons to 
consume. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]That's a ridiculous 
oversimplification... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF06][18:]Remember this... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]In this world, you might as well be 
dead if you don't fully understand 
Magatsuhi. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF06][18:]Magatsuhi... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]It's used as an offering. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]It is the power needed to call forth 
the god of creation. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]It is essential to this world's 
existence. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF06][18:]One who possesses a strong will 
can change everything in this world. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]When "Reason"--one's ideology-- 
has been spread, and Magatsuhi has 
been gathered, 
<end> 
<start>[18:]god will descend from above and 
reshape the very foundation of 
the world. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Yes, for the sole purpose of 
creation, this world of chaos 
was brought into existence... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]...by me. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF06][18:]Soon, my dream will be realized. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]A complete circle of stillness, 
in harmony with the workings of 
time... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]The world of Shijima will be born. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF06][18:]Mantra believes they've destroyed 
this base, but as you can see, 
the core is fully functional... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Nothing more needs to be done. 
The targeted amount of Magatsuhi 
will be reached shortly. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF06][18:]However, they deserve to be 
punished. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]We'll use them as an example... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]...of what happens to those who 
oppose the Assembly of Nihilo. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]This is a good opportunity. 
Witness what is about to take place. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Using the Magatsuhi stored here, 
I will call on my new strength. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF06][18:]The time has come... 
Activate the Nightmare System! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF06][18:]Do you understand what is 
happening? 
<end> 
<start>[18:]It's a system which gives me total 
control over the flow of Magatsuhi 
on a worldwide scale... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]This tiny facility 
pales in comparison. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]As my first target, I have selected 
Ikebukuro, the home of Mantra's 
headquarters. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]The Magatsuhi in that area will be 
depleted, and the Mantra will die out 
in no time. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF06][18:]...Oh, I forgot to mention. 
[12:FF02][11:FF02]plays a key part in this system. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]She's been a great help to me. 
Her abilities as the Maiden 
have been invaluable. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF06][18:]...Are you worried about 
[12:FF02]? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF06][18:]I am sorry to say, but she is 
not here. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]I doubt that you will ever 
see her again. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]She is the Maiden of creation... 
not the teacher you once knew. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF06][18:]You risked your life and came all 
this way, and you say it was not 
for her? 
<end> 
<start>[18:]...Well, it doesn't matter. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]She is not here anyways. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF06][18:]...You were not meant to survive 
the Conception in the first place. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Your attachment to the previous 
world will only serve to deepen 
your despair. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]...I should not have been 
so merciful back then. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF06][18:]Your pain, your suffering... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]I shall end it here. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF06][18:]I don't know what hopes and 
dreams you brought with you here, 
but... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]...there is not a single thing that 
you can accomplish in this world. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF06][18:]Now, go and join the others 
that you have lost... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF06]...So you defeated me. 
<end> 
<start>But, you will never be able to find 
our commander, or the Maiden. 
<end> 
<start>The Nightmare System 
has been activated. 
<end> 
<start>This base will soon be closed down, 
and the way to the Maiden will be 
lost forever... 
<end> 
<start>Begone, demon! It is we, 
the Assembly of Nihilo, 
who will create the new world!! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained the Magatama 
[2:FF03]Anathema[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][6:FF01]Welcome. 
Take all the time you need. 
<start>[7:FF07][6:FF01]What are you going to buy? 
<start>[7:FF07][6:FF01]How many will you buy? 
<start>[7:FF07][6:FF01]What are you going to sell? 
<start>[7:FF07][6:FF01]How many will you sell? 
<start>[7:FF07][6:FF01]Hmmm...  
You can't hold anymore of that. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][6:FF01]It'll be a total of [2:FF05][3:FF04] Macca[2:FF01]. 
Is that okay? 
<start>[7:FF07][6:FF01]Hmmm...  
You can't hold any more Macca. 
<end> 
<start>I'll only be able to give you what  
fits in your wallet. Is that okay? 
<start>[7:FF07][6:FF01]Thank you so much! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][6:FF01]Is there anything else 
I can help you with? 
<start>[7:FF07][6:FF01]It's great having  
my own shop, but... 
<end> 
<start>I want to go search for something 
that nobody's seen before... 
<end> 
<start>I wonder if I should  
join your party... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][6:FF01]This is a dummy. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][6:FF01]This is a dummy. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][6:FF01]This is a dummy. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][6:FF01]This is a dummy. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][6:FF01]This is a dummy. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][6:FF01]This is a dummy. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][6:FF01]This is a dummy. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][6:FF01]This is a dummy. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][6:FF01]It's great having my  
own shop, but... 
<end> 
<start>I want to go search for something 
that nobody's seen before... 
<end> 
<start>I wonder if I should join  
your party... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][6:FF01]I don't just collect junk. 
<end> 
<start>For example, I sell Magatama as 
well. 
<end> 
<start>I thought they would be useful to 
you... It took me awhile to find them. 
<end> 
<start>I have no clue how to use these 
things, but... 
<end> 
<start>Feel free to buy them, if you'd like. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][6:FF01]This is a dummy. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][6:FF01]This is a dummy. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][6:FF01]Come back anytime. 
I'll try my best to find  
more items! 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07][6:FF01]Thank you for buying so much. 
<end> 
<start>Take this [2:FF05]Lucky Ticket[2:FF01]  
if you'd like. 
<end> 
<start>Acquire ten of them for a raffle.  
You can also use them in any of  
the Junk Shops. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][6:FF01]Ah, you found many  
[2:FF05]Lucky Tickets[2:FF01]! 
<end> 
<start>Okay, pick one box that you like. 
I'll give you what's inside. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][6:FF01]Uh... It's a [2:FF05][3:FF04][2:FF01]. 
...Is it something useful? 
<end> 
<start>Big box. 
<start>[7:FF07][6:FF01]By the way... I got this  
from a demon for 60 Macca the 
other day. 
<end> 
<start>It's called the [2:FF02]Star Key[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>But, I'm not interested in it. 
I'm only interested in man-made 
items. 
<end> 
<start>So, I'll give it to you  
if you'd like. 
<end> 
<start>Do you want it? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07][6:FF01]I see. 
<end> 
<start>Okay then, here you go. 
<end> 
<start>> [13:FF01] received 
the [2:FF02]Star Key[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>Well, I hope you enjoy 
the rest of your shopping.  
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][6:FF01]I see. 
<end> 
<start>Well, tell me when you want it. 
I'll give it to you anytime. 
<end> 
<start>Yeah, just like that. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...Only one of us will escape 
this domain alive. 
<end> 
<start>The victor shall claim the loser's 
candelabrum, and return in triumph. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You hold a candelabrum... 
Then, like me, you must be seeking 
supreme power. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]That I cannot allow. 
<end> 
<start>Only the greatest warrior is worthy 
of such power. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]It is meant for a master 
swordsman... 
<end> 
<start>one who, amidst blood and 
applause, has put an end 
to countless lives... 
<end> 
<start>That warrior is I, Matador. 
<end> 
<start>It's unfortunate that we have 
no spectators, 
<end> 
<start>but I believe this will be 
an excellent show regardless, 
as you and I contend for 
the candelabra. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I'm sorry to say, but it seems 
you are rather weak to be 
in possession of a candelabrum. 
<end> 
<start>You should give it to someone 
more deserving, like myself... 
But, since it's unlikely that 
you'll heed my advice... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I challenge you to a duel, 
<end> 
<start>to see which of us is truly 
worthy of the candelabra... 
<end> 
<start>I swear, by my sword and capote, 
that I will once again prove 
victorious!! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...Welcome to the arena of blood. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Now, let the battle begin! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 
the [2:FF02]Candelabrum of Foundation[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...... 
<end> 
<start>[18:][12:FF01], you recovered 
the candelabrum from that Fiend... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]I knew I could count on you... 
even if the world changed. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]I believed in you... that you would 
always be my strength... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Here is what my master has to say... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]The candelabrum that you 
acquired... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]It was part of his prized collection. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]The candelabra are flames of life 
that control the flow of Magatsuhi 
within the Labyrinth of Amala... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]But, they were stolen by terrible 
Fiends. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]The candelabra grant to 
their possessors access to 
the Labyrinth of Amala. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]However, that privilege is not 
intended for just anyone. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]This place is strictly forbidden 
to all but those my master has 
permitted entry. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]That is why we would like to ask you 
a favor. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Is it possible for you to retrieve 
the candelabra--the flames that 
light the floors of the Labyrinth-- 
<end> 
<start>[18:]and return them here? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]That is my master's request... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]...to recover the eleven candelabra. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]If you are willing to accept 
the task, then you will be allowed 
to enter the Labyrinth of Amala. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]I believe that it is a fair offer, 
but it is up to you to decide. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Will you do it, for my master's sake? 
<end> 
<start>I will. 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]...I see. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]But, please be aware that 
the candelabra have a tendency 
to attract each other. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]As you spend time contemplating... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]...your candelabrum is calling out 
to others, and to the Fiends that 
stole them... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]We will wait, in hope that you 
will recover all the candelabra. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Thank you... [12:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]I knew I could count on you... 
I mean, I knew you would accept 
our offer. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]The candelabra tend to attract each 
other. That is why I gave you one. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]As long as you have your 
candelabrum, you will eventually 
come across the others. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]When you retrieve a candelabrum, 
please place it on the pedestal 
in the corresponding floor of 
the Labyrinth. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]I will reward you as you return them 
to their rightful places. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]If you hold your candelabrum to 
the spinning drum of Amala... 
the device referred to as 
a "terminal" in Tokyo... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]...you will be able to enter 
and leave here freely. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Please be careful. 
I wish you the best... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]...Preparations are complete. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Let us see if our chosen Fiend 
will emerge victorious... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]...if he is the one we have been 
waiting for. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]A demon is born twice... 
<end> 
<start>...Will he accept darkness...? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]...Thank you, [12:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]I don't know why, 
but I had a feeling that 
you'd come and save me. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]It's funny... 
I told you that I'd be 
your strength, 
<end> 
<start>[18:]and you ended up helping me 
instead. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]I have no power whatsoever. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]How can I control the world, 
when I can't even take control 
of my own life...? 
<end> 
<start>[18:]As the Maiden, I just do 
Hikawa's bidding. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]"I would like you to become 
the pillar of the new world." 
That's what he told me. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]In the end, 
I was nothing but a tool 
for collecting Magatsuhi... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]It's true that the Conception 
did take place, and I assisted 
in making it happen. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]The world is about to be reborn, 
<end> 
<start>[18:]but as it stands now, 
the new world is going to be a far 
cry from what I had hoped for. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]I dreamed of an ideal world 
where people were grateful 
to be alive... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]...I didn't like how the world was 
before. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]People said they wanted peace, 
but they continued to act selfishly, 
accepting no personal responsibility 
for the world's problems. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Nobody realized it, 
but they were not really happy. 
They were simply lazy. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]No one had the desire to compete 
or become strong. 
And there was no need to, either. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]That's why I thought... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]...that we'd eventually lose 
our power and fade away. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]No wonder I was used by Hikawa... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]...But, it's not over yet. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]The world is still being 
recreated... 
Its shape is not yet fixed. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]It was here that I discovered 
my god, a god that even Hikawa 
is unaware of... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]She was drawn here by 
the power of Magatsuhi. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]She will surely teach me 
the Reason for creation... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Fool who bears the name Freedom... 
<end> 
<start>Under the light of liberty, 
your wrongs shall be forgiven. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I am [2:FF02]Aradia[2:FF01]. 
I have come from the far reaches 
of Amala. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]It is my duty to bestow freedom. 
Ask, and you shall be set free. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]If you deem yourself right, 
light will return to the world, 
but so will darkness. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Pursue the way of creation! 
<end> 
<start>You yourself are a world too. 
<end> 
<start>Do not obey others; 
do what you believe is right. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You received power from Aradia. 
<end> 
<start>> You can now employ 
2 additional demons. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]This woman will soon recover 
her lost power. 
<end> 
<start>She will set forth on the path 
of creation, and I will guide her. 
<end> 
<start>Go, and see the world with 
your own eyes. From there 
will your creation begin... 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> Add Candelabrum of Sovereignty 
to inventory? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]What do you want to do? 
<end> 
<start>Black Visor flag on 
<start>Black Visor flag on 
<start>[7:FF07]> The hole is blocked... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The path is blocked... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> There is a shaft leading downward. 
<end> 
<start>> Jump in? 
<end> 
<start>> Return to the entrance 
of the Labyrinth? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Return to the previous Kalpa? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> There is a huge pedestal. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You do not have a candelabrum 
for this pedestal... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Will you light the [2:FF02]Candelabrum 
of Sovereignty[2:FF01]? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> You lit the [2:FF02]Candelabrum 
of Sovereignty[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The candelabrum has been lit... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The flames illuminate the passage 
beyond. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> There is a switch. 
Will you activate it? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The switch has been activated. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> There is a tombstone without 
a name on it... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Will you put on the Black Visor? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The inscription on the tombstone 
changed. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The inscription on the tombstone 
remained the same. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> "Record of Mithra: 
Defeated in [3:FF01] turn(s)." 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> "Record of Mithra: 
Defeated in [2:FF02][3:FF01][2:FF01] turn(s)." 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It is inscribed, 
"Here lies Mithra." 
<end>

Mithra... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> "Record of Thor: 
Defeated in [3:FF01] turn(s)."

<start>[7:FF07]> "Record of Thor:

<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It is inscribed, 
"Here lies Thor."

Thor...

<start>[7:FF07]> You recall the battle against 
Baal Avatar... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I shall now test your heart... 
<end> 
<start>If you are a true demon, 
then you may see what lies beyond 
this door. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Then, turn back and leave here... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You have no demon to present. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The door would not budge... 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]If you wish to pass, 
let one of great strength 
step forward. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]If you wish to pass, 
let one of great magic 
step forward. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]If you wish to pass, 
let one of great vitality 
step forward. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]If you wish to pass, 
let one of great agility 
step forward. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]If you wish to pass, 
let one of great luck 
step forward. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]If you wish to pass, 
let one brimming with light 
step forward. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]If you wish to pass, 
let one whose soul is black 
step forward. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]If you wish to pass, 
let one who embodies chaos 
step forward. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]If you wish to pass, 
let the one who has been with you 
the longest step forward. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Your comrade's strength does not 
meet my expectations! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Your comrade's magic does not 
meet my expectations! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Your comrade's vitality does not 
meet my expectations! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Your comrade's agility does not 
meet my expectations! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Your comrade's luck does not 
meet my expectations! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]This is not the one I seek. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Begone! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Your comrade's strength 
is admirable indeed... 
You may pass. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Your comrade's magic 
is admirable indeed... 
You may pass. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Your comrade's vitality 
is admirable indeed... 
You may pass. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Your comrade's agility 
is admirable indeed... 
You may pass. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Your comrade's luck 
is admirable indeed... 
You may pass. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You have with you a truly noble 
comrade... You may pass. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You have with you a comrade 
as black as night... 
You may pass. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Have [3:FF01] step forward? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Have [3:FF01] step forward? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Have [3:FF01] step forward? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Have [3:FF01] step forward? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Have [3:FF01] step forward? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Have [3:FF01] step forward? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> [3:FF01] is acting 
strangely... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]What's happening...? 
I feel this... power... 
growing inside me... 
<end> 
<start>!! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]What? Why are you looking at me 
like that? 
<end> 
<start>I've been right here by your side 
from the very beginning. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Um, you're not waiting for me 
to say my line, are you...? 
*sigh* Alright, alright... 
<end> 
<start>I'm [2:FF05][3:FF01][2:FF01] of 
the [2:FF05][3:FF05][2:FF01] clan. 
Please take care of me... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Attention trespassers... 
<end> 
<start>We are the law here. 
<end> 
<start>We will only permit you to use us 
[2:FF02]three times[2:FF01] before you are forced 
to leave. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Attention trespassers... 
<end> 
<start>You are only permitted to use us 
[2:FF02]two more times[2:FF01]!

<start>[7:FF07]Attention trespassers...

<start>You are only permitted to use us 
[2:FF02]one more time[2:FF01]! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Attention trespassers... 
<end> 
<start>You have now passed through us 
three times. 
<end> 
<start>You will not be allowed to advance 
any further! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]We have warned you, 
foolish demon! 
<end> 
<start>Leave this instant! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> There is a lift that leads to 
the deepest part of the Labyrinth. 
Get on it? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Gee, you look worn out. 
<end> 
<start>Would you like to rest for a while? 
Only 500 Macca! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Oh... Well, please come again! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Oh, you don't have enough Macca... 
Come back when you do. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You must be thirsty. 
Here, have a drink... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Your party recovered. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Go ahead, have some more... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Are you feeling better? 
Here's some more... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Your party recovered some more. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...Have... another... drink... 
<start>[7:FF07]> Your wallet feels really light... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The lift does not seem to be 
working... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You have come at last, 
[13:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Izanami and I had long watched 
over the land of the rising sun. 
<end> 
<start>However, as was destined, 
the world fell... 
and our power was lost. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Unable to wield our strength, 
<end> 
<start>we awaited the one to whom 
we could entrust the future. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...And now you have come. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][13:FF01], please accept 
our gift. 
<end> 
<start>It will help you create a new world 
in this space filled with chaos, 
<end> 
<start>as Izanami and I did when we met 
long ago... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Your body surges with power... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You are now able to attack 
more often. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Farewell, [13:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>Our job is done. 
We pray for your success. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]May the heavens bless you... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You find yourself in 
a strange place. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> A voice echoes in your head... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...Come... 
<end> 
<start>...Show me... the strength... 
of a demon... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The old man and the woman 
disappeared... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...This way... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...So, you made it... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...Your strength... is outstanding... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...We shall meet again... soon... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]By my master's orders, 
I'll treat your wounds. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Dr. Dark healed your party. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]GO ON... 
THEY ARE WAITING FOR YOU. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Will you leave the area? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> There is a Mystical Chest. 
Will you open it? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> You did not open 
the Mystical Chest. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 
[2:FF05][3:FF01][2:FF01] x [3:FF02]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You see a Cache Cube. 
Will you open it? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> You did not open 
the Cache Cube. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It's empty. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 
[2:FF05][3:FF01][2:FF01] x [3:FF02]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 
the Magatama [2:FF05][3:FF01][2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 
[2:FF05][3:FF01] Macca[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It's a trap. 
<end> 
<start>> Your party took damage. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It's empty. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> [3:FF03] found something. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]............ 
> You obtained 
[2:FF05][3:FF01][2:FF01] x [3:FF02]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It can't be used here. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The light effect wore off. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The repel effect wore off. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The attract effect wore off. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The levitation effect wore off. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Select a floor. 
<end> 
<start>[3:FF01][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF02][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF03][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF04][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF05][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF06][80EA] 
<start>[7:FF07]> Message Test. 
First, the basics... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Message Test. 
Next are the choices... 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]Yes, you say? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]No, you say? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The path is blocked. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You sense a strong power from 
beyond the door. 
<end> 
<start>> Will you enter? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]It's natural for every living thing 
to die... Therefore, medical 
treatment contradicts nature. 
<end> 
<start>So... Did you come here to defy 
nature and be treated? 
<end> 
<start>No. 
<start>[7:FF07]Good. One lives, one dies... 
That's the way it should be. 
<end> 
<start>I pray that you find rest soon. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...I am a doctor, after all. 
I'll treat your wounds. 
<end> 
<start>But, I'm gonna charge you 
[3:FF01] Macca. Alright? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> ...... 
<end> 
<start>> Dr. Dark healed your party. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...... 
<end> 
<start>Money first. Get outta here. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The angels cast down from heaven 
had no other choice but to become 
demons... 
<end> 
<start>Are we fallen ones to blame...? 
Or is it the fault of those who cast 
us down...? 
<end> 
<start>I wonder what our master thinks... 
<end> 
<start>I'd like to ask him one of these days. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I hear that you can buy demons 
with unique abilities somewhere 
around here... 
<end> 
<start>But, now I'm lost. What to do...? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]So, you have made it to 
the last floor. 
<end> 
<start>This is where the women loyal to 
our master gather. 
<end> 
<start>You have done well in not 
disappointing him. 
<end> 
<start>But, if you underestimate us, 
you will not live to regret it! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]What a cute lad! It's rare for young 
men to come here. 
<end> 
<start>I'm about to burst! 
<end> 
<start>*sigh* ...I bet I'm nothing but 
an old hag to you, right? 
<end> 
<start>More like an 'old bag'. 
<start>[7:FF07]You made my day! Here's a token 
of my appreciation! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Is that so...? 
<end> 
<start>You know, it wouldn't kill ya to 
throw a compliment my way. 
<end> 
<start>It's called 'being nice', you little 
creep. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Now, don't let anything happen to 
that cute little face! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The demon healed you. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You're almost to the very bottom 
of the Labyrinth. 
<end> 
<start>Our master is waiting there. 
Don't give up now! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You better pay close attention, 
or you'll get lost. 
<end> 
<start>Even if you think you've found 
a dead-end, make absolutely sure 
before you try another direction. 
<end> 
<start>Well, that's my advice. Choose to 
follow it if you wish. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Somewhere in here are doors that 
will test your demons. 
<end> 
<start>They test various attributes and 
may even kill a demon if they are 
inclined to do so. 
<end> 
<start>Some will ask for specific demons. 
<end> 
<start>If you want to go on ahead, 
be sure to bring a variety of demons 
with you. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]It seems that this floor is full 
of demons that live by the call 
of the wild. 
<end> 
<start>Wild or not, they're still dangerous. 
If you're going to look around, 
be on your guard. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Everybody here is waiting for 
the final battle. 
<end> 
<start>At our master's command, we will 
rise to the heavens once again. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]CAN YOU FEEL IT? 
<end> 
<start>I CAN FEEL GREAT POWER 
FROM THIS DOOR, 
WHICH LEADS BELOW... 
<end> 
<start>SOMETHING EVEN STRONGER 
THAN BEELZEBUB... 
<end> 
<start>IF YOU CHOOSE TO PROCEED, 
BE CAREFUL. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]CAN YOU FEEL IT? 
<end> 
<start>THE GREAT POWER I FELT 
IS GONE... 
<end> 
<start>I CANNOT BELIEVE THERE IS 
ONE WHO IS EVEN STRONGER! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Human... or demon... 
O one with power. 
<end> 
<start>Would you like me to measure 
the movements of your soul? 
<end> 
<start>Sure, go ahead. 
<start>[7:FF07]Imagine you are in the mountains... 
<end> 
<start>...and you see a human about to be 
attacked by a wild animal. 
<end> 
<start>The animal begins to maul 
the defenseless human! 
<end> 
<start>As a fellow human, your heart would 
compel you to chase away the beast 
and rescue the victim. 
<end> 
<start>Ah...! But, now you're a demon! 
<end> 
<start>Suppose you kill the animal with 
your newfound strength... 
You crush it barehanded! 
<end> 
<start>The human would then fear you, 
since you had proven yourself more 
powerful than a wild animal! 
<end> 
<start>With your demonic strength, you can 
no longer be human. You are more 
dangerous than a wild animal... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]It is your choice. Do as your heart 
desires. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...... 
<end> 
<start>...If you get stronger... 
<end> 
<start>...I'll sell you something special. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...I'm glad you made it here. 
<end> 
<start>...If you get stronger... 
<end> 
<start>...I'll sell you something special. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...I've got nothing else to sell you. 
...Hey, don't worry. 
<end> 
<start>I'm sure there are other brokers 
besides me in this labyrinth. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...You're pretty strong. 
<end> 
<start>...I'll sell you something special. 
Interested? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...On second thought, forget what 
I just said. 
<end> 
<start>The demon you have there... 
Yeah, the one with only one eye... 
<end> 
<start>As long as you've got that demon 
with you, I can't sell you mine. 
Come back after you get rid of it. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...You're pretty strong. 
<end> 
<start>I'll sell you something special. 
<end> 
<start>Wait a minute, your party's full. 
<end> 
<start>If you want a new companion, 
make some room first and then 
come back. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Here's what I'm selling... 
<end> 
<start>...the strongest elephant you 
ever saw, with the power of 
a demon. 
<end> 
<start>In battle, he'll bust out attacks 
that'll crush any enemy! 
<end> 
<start>I'm asking 200000 Macca. 
I know it's kinda high, but it's well 
worth the price... So, you want it? 
<end> 
<start>Alright, I'll buy it. 
<start>[7:FF07]Excellent choice! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You purchased a demon from 
the Shady Broker. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...WoOo, I'm... MaSAKadO... sSssS! 
<end> 
<start>NiCE tO mEEt yoUuUUuuu... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The demon is jiggling... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]That's fine. If you change your mind, 
feel free to come back anytime. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Hey, you don't have enough Macca! 
<end> 
<start>Come back when you have more 
money, okay? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]At our master's request, I have been 
waiting for you... 
<end> 
<start>Yours is an existence unbound by  
this world, and for that reason,  
you have infinite potential. 
<end> 
<start>Will the battle with god occur as 
our master wishes...? 
<end> 
<start>Or, will we forever remain in waiting, 
while history repeats itself? 
<end> 
<start>...I have thought about this at great 
length. May I ask you a question? 
<end> 
<start>Go ahead. 
<start>[7:FF07]Very well. 
<end> 
<start>It is true that all living things 
must perish... 
<end> 
<start>Bound by the invisible threads of 
fate, humans die tragic deaths... 
<end> 
<start>Does that seem fair to you? 
<end> 
<start>If you lost a loved one in a horrible 
accident, would you curse god? 
<end> 
<start>.................. 
<end> 
<start>There's no need to answer. 
<end> 
<start>But, if you feel that fate has 
cheated you... then go and see 
our master. 
<end> 
<start>Yes... Though long frozen, 
time shall flow again... 
<end> 
<start>...towards the final battle. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...I see. Then, I will leave you be. 
<end> 
<start>I pray that you may determine your 
own destiny. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The door has become deformed 
and won't open. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Nothing happened. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You see a vending machine! 
<end> 
<start>> You have enough change 
to buy a drink. 
<end> 
<start>> Will you buy something? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> The drink that came out 
isn't any of the ones listed. 
<end> 
<start>> You obtained a [2:FF05]Mysterious Drink[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You decide to hurry on ahead. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The vending machine is sold-out. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The entrance is closed tight. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Dang! 
<end> 
<start>I came here to sell medicine, 
and now I get dragged into 
all this rubbish. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I saw it!! I saw a human go 
underground!! 
<end> 
<start>It's him... This is his doing!! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> There is an [2:FF02]Employee ID Card[2:FF01]. 
Will you pick it up? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained an [2:FF02]Employee ID Card[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You gave up on 
the [2:FF02]Employee ID Card[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You feel like you met [2:FF02]Hikawa[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Eh!? 
<end> 
<start>What's goin' on??? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I saw a demon at the annex... 
<end> 
<start>Wait a minute, demons really 
exist!? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You're still alive, too? 
<end> 
<start>Boy, I sure see a lot of humans 
today. 
<end> 
<start>As a matter of fact... 
I just saw one go down to 
the basement. 
<end> 
<start>I'm envious of you guys! 
Being able to walk around and 
all... *sigh* 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The Vortex World... 
That's what we call this place. 
<end> 
<start>Of course, the world hasn't been 
reborn yet. 
<end> 
<start>And I don't know what it's gonna be 
like when it does get reborn... 
<start>[7:FF07]If you negotiate well with demons, 
they'll join your party. 
<end> 
<start>About negotiating... Well, I dunno 
all the details, so I can't tell you 
anything specific. 
<end> 
<start>But, don't let that stop you from 
trying! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You're not a human, are you? 
Then, let me tell you something 
good... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Listen up. First, you need to get 
demons to join you. 
<end> 
<start>That's right! You need demons on 
your side. 
<end> 
<start>If you run into a demon, try starting 
a conversation. 
<end> 
<start>I'm sure you'll get a response. 
It won't always be a good response, 
mind you! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You see it too, huh!? 
That g-giant demon in the lobby??? 
<end> 
<start>We c-can't go near there! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Eeeek! A demon! 
There's a demon!! 
<end> 
<start>Demon's are scary, right?? 
They attack people, right??? 
<end> 
<start>EEEEK!! I need to text message 
my boyfriend!! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]............ 
<end> 
<start>You're a demon, too??? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I hate hospitals. They always 
give me an eerie feeling. I'd hate to 
die in one! 
<end> 
<start>Wha'? Now's not the time? 
Demons have appeared!? 
<end> 
<start>For reals?! ...Eh, just as long as 
there are no ghosts. I'm so scared 
of ghosts! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]When you fight demons, you'll have 
a better chance of winning if 
you can get more actions in during 
your turn. 
<end> 
<start>By using attacks that the enemy is 
weak against, you'll be able to 
attack more frequently. 
<end> 
<start>But, the enemy will gain the upper 
hand if you do the opposite! 
<end> 
<start>So, make sure you use your actions 
wisely. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]What!? You're going to defeat 
Forneus!? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]Hahaha... Yeah, right! 
I'll give you all my money 
if you can do that. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I guess I heard wrong... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Amazing... You really beat Forneus!! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]............ 
<end> 
<start>You really beat him... 
<end> 
<start>Dang! A promise is a promise!! 
Take it!! 
<end> 
<start>> You obtained [2:FF05]100 Macca[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You wanna get through? 
<end> 
<start>What, you think you can beat me? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]Oh yeah...? 
<end> 
<start>Then, bring it on!!! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]That's a smart decision! 
<end> 
<start>It's best you don't leave this 
hospital. 
<end> 
<start>Give it up, loser. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You feel the presence of someone 
on the roof. 
<end> 
<start>> Enter through the doorway? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]Entering big map. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]If I knew this would happen 
for reals... 
<end> 
<start>I should've listened to Hikawa. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I don't know the details, but... 
<end> 
<start>I heard that this hospital did 
some pretty horrific things! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> For some reason, you cannot 
go inside the X-ray room. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It's locked from the other side. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You're injured... Here, let me 
heal you. 
<end> 
<start>There you go. Don't push yourself 
too hard. 
<end> 
<start>> Your wounds have healed. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The beginning of the 
Vortex ends here. 
<end> 
<start>After this event, 
the world will become a Vortex. 
<end> 
<start>It will then convert you 
into a demonic human. 
<end> 
<start>Then, you will wake up 
in room 203. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The door is locked. 
Will you unlock it? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> You unlocked the door. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The door is still locked. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Hey, kid!! This place is dangerous!! 
<end> 
<start>There's demons past here!! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained Chakra Drop x 2. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained Magic Bead x 1. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Select a floor. 
<end> 
<start>2F 
<start>[7:FF07]> Select a floor. 
<end> 
<start>1F 
<start>[7:FF07]> Select a floor. 
<end> 
<start>1F 
<start>[7:FF07]Insert your [2:FF02]Annex Gate Pass[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Insert your [2:FF02]Annex Gate Pass[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>> You don't have the right card... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Insert your [2:FF02]Personnel ID Card[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Insert your [2:FF02]Personnel ID Card[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>> You used the [2:FF02]Personnel ID Card[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Insert your [2:FF02]Annex Gate Pass[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>> You used the [2:FF02]Annex Gate Pass[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>The gate closed! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]*ring* *ring* 
<end> 
<start>Hello? Hello? 
<end> 
<start>Oh, hell! 
The elevator stopped 
working!! 
<end> 
<start>I'm pressing the emergency 
button, but nothing's 
happening... 
<end> 
<start>Dammit! 
Modern technology my ass! 
<end> 
<start>> You can hear the sound 
of Isamu kicking the door. 
<end> 
<start>...Anyways, this isn't the time 
for Chiaki! 
Get someone over here! 
<end> 
<start>Yes, I know who Reiko is... 
She's on the second floor! 
<end> 
<start>If Reiko's not there, 
anyone'll do... 
<end> 
<start>Any...wa...y...call...som...one... 
<end> 
<start>> The signal is weakening. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> This door leads to the roof. 
<end> 
<start>> It's locked. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> No one is here... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The man left. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The door is locked. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The child and the old woman 
have disappeared... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Someone is up ahead... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07](no message) 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]What's wrong, my little master? 
Are you wondering about that 
person over there? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I see. 
My, my... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]But, we're busy at the moment. 
Let's come back later. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Perhaps it is... 
an exclusive love 
for one's self. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Turn your principle into power 
and survive the chaos. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You're late. 
We're ready to go home! 
<end> 
<start>...Just kiddin'. 
Look, we've been waiting,  
but we haven't met Yuko. 
<end> 
<start>This hospital's weird. 
There's no one around here, 
even at the reception area. 
<end> 
<start>I had Isamu look for Yuko, 
but he hasn't come back yet. 
<end> 
<start>*sigh* 
Maybe I should go home...  
<end> 
<start>What's that magazine? 
<end> 
<start>Ayakashi Monthly? 
Never heard of it. 
Is it new? 
<end> 
<start>Do me a favor? 
Could you look for Isamu? 
I wanna get outta here already. 
<end> 
<start>He's probably somewhere on 
the second floor. 
<end> 
<start>I'll be waiting here. 
...Whoa, this is one 
bizarre-lookin' magazine. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Can you find [12:FF03]? 
I see no point in staying here 
if we can't find Ms. [11:FF02]. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]He should be on the second floor, 
where the patients' rooms are. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]This magazine is so... bizarre... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Whoa!!! 
<end> 
<start>Oh, it's you. 
Dude! 
Don't scare me like that! 
<end> 
<start>Still, something's seriously up 
with this hospital. 
No one was there, huh? 
<end> 
<start>Not a living soul. 
<start>[7:FF07]Really? 
Something's definitely up! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Really? 
Oh... you mean Chiaki. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]*sigh* 
I was so looking forward to 
hangin' with Yuko. 
<end> 
<start>Man, what is up with 
this haunted house of 
a hospital? 
<end> 
<start>Seen the basement? Dude!  
It's like they're making  
some sorta monster down there. 
<end> 
<start>Just thinking about it 
makes me......! 
<end> 
<start>Hey, man...  
I gotta go take a leak. 
<end> 
<start>Chiaki's in the lobby, right? 
Let's meet up there. 
Peace out! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> [12:FF03] left. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> [12:FF03] left the room. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> [12:FF04] isn't in the lobby... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Hey, man, 
about this magazine... 
<end> 
<start>There's a special report on 
this group called the 'Gaea cult'. 
<end> 
<start>Their leader, Hikawa... 
I've seen him before! 
<end> 
<start>It was a while back, 
and he was with Yuko. 
<end> 
<start>He's scary. According to the 
Scripture of Miroku, the world 
'will be swallowed by chaos'. 
<end> 
<start>I highly doubt anything's gonna 
happen, but I'm worried about 
Yuko and this hospital... 
<end> 
<start>Oh, yeah. When I told Isamu about  
all this, he went to have another 
look around. 
<end> 
<start>He gave me this. 
Check it out. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained an [2:FF02]Employee ID Card[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I'll be waiting here. 
I wonder if we'll find her... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I wonder if we'll find her... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You can hear eerie sounds 
from inside. 
<end> 
<start>> Will you enter? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> Someone is in the other hallway... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Shouldn't you hurry? 
The countdown's already started. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]It's almost time. 
Chaos will be here... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> There is no one here... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Someone is in the other hallway. 
<start>[7:FF07]> You can hear something 
in the other room... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Will you leave the area? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> There is a Mystical Chest. 
Will you open it? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> You did not open 
the Mystical Chest. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 
[2:FF05][3:FF01][2:FF01] x [3:FF02]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You see a Cache Cube. 
Will you open it? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> You did not open 
the Cache Cube. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It's empty. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 
[2:FF05][3:FF01][2:FF01] x [3:FF02]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 
the Magatama [2:FF05][3:FF01][2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 
[2:FF05][3:FF01] Macca[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It's a trap. 
<end> 
<start>> Your party took damage. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It's empty. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> [3:FF03] found something. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]............ 
> You obtained 
[2:FF05][3:FF01][2:FF01] x [3:FF02]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It can't be used here. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The light effect wore off. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The repel effect wore off. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The attract effect wore off. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The levitation effect wore off. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Select a floor. 
<end> 
<start>[3:FF01][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF02][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF03][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF04][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF05][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF06][80EA] 
<start>[7:FF07]> You can hear eerie sounds from 
the room. 
<end> 
<start>> Will you enter the room? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> The door is closed tight. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The door is locked from 
the other side. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The door is closed tight. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The door will not open. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The door is locked. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The door is unlocked. 
<end> 
<start>> Will you enter? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> There is a notice on the information 
board. 
<end> 
<start>"This hospital consists of 
a [2:FF02]main building[2:FF01] and an [2:FF02]annex[2:FF01], 
connected by a [2:FF02]passageway[2:FF01]." 
<end> 
<start>"Only authorized personnel are 
allowed in the [2:FF02]basement[2:FF01]." 
<end> 
<start>> Light is coming from the hole.  
<end> 
<start>> Will you hold your hand over it? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> There's a switch. 
<end> 
<start>> Will you operate it? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]Oh, no you don't! 
<end> 
<start>I won't let you get past here. 
<end> 
<start>How's this? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The demon has operated the switch. 
<end> 
<start>How dare you!! You're dead meat!! 
<end> 
<start>> You defeated the demon guard. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> There is a pedestal emitting 
white light... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> There is a pedestal emitting 
yellow light...

<start>[7:FF07]> There is a pedestal emitting 
green light... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> There is a pedestal emitting 
red light... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Will you use the White Kila? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Will you use the Yellow Kila? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Will you use the Green Kila? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Will you use the Red Kila? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The pedestal is no longer emitting 
light. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The pedestal is no longer emitting 
light. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The pedestal is no longer emitting 
light. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The pedestal is no longer emitting 
light. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The floor is too unstable to proceed 
ahead. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The floor is stable. 
<end> 
<start>This dome is camouflage; the real 
thing is downstairs. 
<end> 
<start>You saw that spinning room, right? 
I'll fix that, as always. 
<end> 
<start>You'd go even if I told you not to, 
right? ...Yeah, that's what I thought. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Alright, that's enough... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]*chuckle* Don't even try to resist... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I found you. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Now, let's finish this... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You defeated the demon guard. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You defeated the demon guards. 
<end> 
<start>> Link to the altar? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I am Eligor, one of the fallen angels. 
<end> 
<start>I guard this Kila under the order of 
our commander. 
<end> 
<start>Now... You seem to have some 
brains, unlike those Mantra fools. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I like those with intelligence. 
<end> 
<start>To show you my respect, I will kill 
you painlessly. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I won't let you have the Kila... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Die!! 
<start>[7:FF07]Halt... 
<end> 
<start>I am Berith, the great duke of hell. 
<end> 
<start>Insolent scoundrel, put down 
the Kila and begone! 
<end> 
<start>If you say so. 
<start>[7:FF07]Then, hurry and begone! 
<end> 
<start>No, wait... 
<end> 
<start>I can see your future... 
<end> 
<start>I can see your face and body 
bloodied by my hands... 
<end> 
<start>If that is the future, then so shall 
it be! Die!! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I see... 
<end> 
<start>Then, prepare yourself... 
<end> 
<start>...for my spear shall pierce through 
your insolent skull! 
<end> 
<start>> You defeated Beiji-Weng! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]So, you're here... 
<end> 
<start>I'm Ose... one of the fallen angels, 
and a mighty warrior of Nihilo. 
<end> 
<start>Commander Hikawa is in the room 
behind me. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]However... 
<end> 
<start>Only by my death will you gain entry. 
I do warn you...  I've never been 
defeated! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Prepare for your journey to 
oblivion! 
<start>> You defeated Legion! 
<end> 
<start>> You see the [2:FF02]Red Kila[2:FF01] before you. 
<end> 
<start>> Will you take it? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained the [2:FF02]Red Kila[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You see the [2:FF02]White Kila[2:FF01] before you. 
<end> 
<start>> Will you take it? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained the [2:FF02]White Kila[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It's empty...  
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Hahahaha... What took you so long? 
<end> 
<start>Had a hard time figuring out those 
switches at the storehouse? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I'm Kaiwan... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Sorry, but I can't let you have 
the Kila. So, take a hike. 
<end> 
<start>Hahahaha!! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Kaiwan fled. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]No, no... 
<end> 
<start>I am Kaiwan, but I'm not the one 
with the Kila. 
<end> 
<start>Can't you tell the difference, fool!? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]No, no... 
<end> 
<start>I am Kaiwan, but I'm not the one 
with the Kila. 
<end> 
<start>Are you blind or something!? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]No, no... 
<end> 
<start>I am Kaiwan, but I'm not the one 
with the Kila. 
<end> 
<start>What an insult! You're gonna pay! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Hahahaha! You've met an unlucky 
one, alright... 
<end> 
<start>Well, I guess it suits you... 
<end> 
<start>Hahahahahaha! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Looks like you've run into some 
nasty demons, boy. 
<end> 
<start>I'm sure you'll have fun playing 
together! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]That's right... I'm the real one. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]It's been fun! It's truly regrettable, 
but I have to kill you now. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...Playtime's over. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You defeated Kaiwan. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> There is no Kila. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained the [2:FF02]Green Kila[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Those idiot Mantra demons fell for it 
hook, line and sinker. 
<end> 
<start>They're probably getting cocky, 
thinking that they destroyed 
the core unit. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Power-shmower. Power's nothing 
without brains! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]......Hm? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Who're you? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Hmmm... 
<end> 
<start>I don't know who you're with, but 
it looks like you have some brains. 
<end> 
<start>You just wanna make a name for 
yourself by taking Commander 
Hikawa's head, huh? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Just our luck... We were getting 
bored of the Mantra's stupidity. 
<end> 
<start>We need to welcome our guests and 
show them off to their afterlife 
comfortably. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Dieeeeeeeeeeee!! 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained the [2:FF02]Yellow Kila[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Halt! 
<end> 
<start>This is the [2:FF02]Assembly of Nihilo[2:FF01], 
the place for those who seek 
silence. 
<end> 
<start>Demons who only believe in power 
are not permitted! 
<end> 
<start>Leave these grounds immediately! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained the Magatama 
[2:FF03]Ankh[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> No one is here... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]There are so many cubes upstairs, 
it's easy to get lost! 
<end> 
<start>If I remember correctly, you need to 
turn all the switches blue. 
<end> 
<start>Oh yeah... I hear a Mantra demon 
got in, so watch out! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You can hear sounds coming from 
inside the room. 
<end> 
<start>> Will you enter? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You sense a strong power from 
beyond the door. 
<end> 
<start>> Will you enter? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Will you leave the area? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> There is a Mystical Chest. 
Will you open it? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> You did not open 
the Mystical Chest. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 
[2:FF05][3:FF01][2:FF01] x [3:FF02]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You see a Cache Cube. 
Will you open it? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> You did not open 
the Cache Cube. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It's empty. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 
[2:FF05][3:FF01][2:FF01] x [3:FF02]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 
the Magatama [2:FF05][3:FF01][2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 
[2:FF05][3:FF01] Macca[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It's a trap. 
<end> 
<start>> Your party took damage. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It's empty. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> [3:FF03] found something. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]............ 
> You obtained 
[2:FF05][3:FF01][2:FF01] x [3:FF02]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It can't be used here. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The light effect wore off. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The repel effect wore off. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The attract effect wore off. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The levitation effect wore off. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Select a floor. 
<end> 
<start>[3:FF01][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF02][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF03][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF04][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF05][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF06][80EA] 
<start>[7:FF07]> You can hear sounds coming from 
inside the room. 
<end> 
<start>> Will you enter? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> You sense a strong power from 
beyond the door. 
<end> 
<start>> Will you enter? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> The door is locked. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The door is unlocked. 
<end> 
<start>> Will you enter? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> The door is locked tight. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Hahaha! World of stillness, my ass! 
Creation? Yeah, right! 
<end> 
<start>The Assembly of Nihilo is in 
shambles! Hahahahahaha! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]We already destroyed the core! 
<end> 
<start>It's all over for Nihilo. The Mantra 
has won! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...Dammit! I haven't seen 
the Commander or the Maiden at all. 
<end> 
<start>Oh well... We got all their treasure, 
anyway. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The round thing up ahead is 
the core--the heart of this 
structure... 
<end> 
<start>...Or was, at least. It ended pretty 
fast. 
<end> 
<start>So, was the report about needing 
[2:FF02]four Kilas[2:FF01] to unlock the core 
a hoax? 
<end> 
<start>...Well, Nihilo probably got scared of 
the Mantra and ran away. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Huh? 
<end> 
<start>I can hear something coming from 
that door. 
<end> 
<start>...Hell, we won. What's there to 
worry about? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Huh? 
<end> 
<start>I can't hear anything coming from 
that door anymore. 
<end> 
<start>...Hell, we won. What's there to 
worry about? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You're the demon that won the trial! 
So, you decided to come here, huh? 
<end> 
<start>...Well, you're too late. 
<end> 
<start>We already finished our attack. 
Hahahahahahaha! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...Oh, a wise guy, eh??? 
<end> 
<start>Did you come here after 
Commander Hikawa? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]If you're just here to get in some 
rubbernecking, I suggest you turn 
back. 
<end> 
<start>I can't guarantee your safety 
anywhere past here. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Commander Hikawa is on Floor B15 
of the core. 
<end> 
<start>But, you need the [2:FF02]four Kilas[2:FF01], 
stakes that control the Magatsuhi 
in this structure, to get to him. 
<end> 
<start>You saw those four pedestals on 
the way here, right? Use the Kilas 
there... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Occasionally, there are visitors like 
you, but they all disappear up ahead. 
<end> 
<start>They all fall prey to the traps made 
by the great Commander Hikawa. 
<end> 
<start>So, why tell you all this? I figure 
you have the right to know before 
you die... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...Well, even if this place goes down, 
we still have an ace up our sleeve. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]............ 
<end> 
<start>This is the storehouse for 
Magatsuhi. 
<end> 
<start>It's separated into three floors, 
and each leads to a storeroom 
where a Kila is kept. 
<end> 
<start>You see that switch? It's set up 
so that it changes the flow of 
Magatsuhi. 
<end> 
<start>*chuckle* 
<end> 
<start>In other words, if you don't use 
the switches properly, you'll never 
make it to the storerooms. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]............ 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]In each of the storerooms is 
a demon guarding the Kila. 
<end> 
<start>Even if someone were to make it 
that far, they'd be killed anyway. 
<end> 
<start>So, that's why we don't have to 
panic. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...Even if you make it to Floor B15, 
'he' is guarding Commander Hikawa. 
<end> 
<start>So, that's why we have nothing to 
fear. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Oh, a demon... 
<end> 
<start>............ 
<end> 
<start>Well... you can get to the storeroom 
on the floor above by turning 
the four switches blue. 
<end> 
<start>............ 
<end> 
<start>An intruder got this far...? 
I hope Commander Hikawa isn't 
slipping! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The Assembly of Nihilo is aiming for 
a world of silence, 
<end> 
<start>a world where we throw away our 
individuality and become a part of 
the grand universe. 
<end> 
<start>There is no pain or struggling 
due to individuality. 
<end> 
<start>...Commander Hikawa is wonderful. 
All shall be bliss... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]We not only have Commander 
Hikawa, but also the Maiden. 
<end> 
<start>She will be the foundation for our 
new world. 
<end> 
<start>So, no matter how much demons 
like you cause trouble, we won't 
be disturbed. 
<end> 
<start>...The world we desire has no need 
for emotions in the first place... 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> There's a crack in the floor. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It seems like you aren't able to use 
the terminal. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The door is gone, trapping you 
inside. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The warp device is not functioning. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> There is a black flame. 
<end> 
<start>> Will you put it out? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The black flame went out and you 
hear something unlock. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The flame is already out. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Will you enter the central temple? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You can sense a strong power 
emanating from the room. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The atmosphere around you 
changed. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained the Magatama [2:FF03]Adama[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Will you leave the area? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Which flag will you turn on? 
<end> 
<start>Isamu gets god. 
<start>Broke the seal for all pyramids. 
<start>[7:FF07]> You saw Isumu get his god. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained Pyramidion. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You set Pyramidion. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You agreed with Musubi. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The seal is broken for all pyramids. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]B-BOOOOOOOOM! THIS IS 
THE SHRINE OF EAT! 
ALL-I-CAN-EAT!! 
<end> 
<start>BOTHER ME AND YOU'LL BE 
ALL-I-CAN-BEAT!! 
B-B-BOOOOOM!!! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]My... Quite handsome. You managed 
to navigate your way through my 
shadows? 
<end> 
<start>I am tired of Magatsuhi. I'll quench 
my thirst with your blood, so come 
here. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I have come from the depths of hell 
for Magatsuhi, but you are quite 
a rare one! 
<end> 
<start>I do not care who you are. I will sink 
my teeth into that body of yours! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]That warp device over there will take 
me to the floor above... 
<end> 
<start>Hmmm... But the shadow... Hmmm... 
If only the shadows weren't there... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]That state of panic... You stepped 
on a shadow, didn't you? 
<end> 
<start>Heh heh... Too bad... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Gyaaaaaaaaah! Ow ow ow... 
<end> 
<start>What's up with this floor? It's full of 
traps! I can't leave either... 
<end> 
<start>Argh, ouch ouch ouch! Light... I need 
to find light! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Gyaaaaaah! 
<end> 
<start>Oh, you too!? You also got sucked 
into Skadi's shadows? Ha-ha-ha! 
<end> 
<start>Argh, ouch ouch ouch! Light... Need 
to find light... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Geez, you're finally here. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You really are a nosy guy! 
<end> 
<start>Well, it doesn't matter to me 
anymore what you're thinking. 
<end> 
<start>But, if you're for Musubi, I've got 
the perfect job for you. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Come through the door. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]This is the forgotten temple that I 
found while checking out 
the network. 
<end> 
<start>There's a crapload of Magatsuhi 
stored here. 
<end> 
<start>But, it's being closely guarded by 
three demons. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Can you go and beat them? It 
makes it easier on me. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...So, you actually came. You really 
are a nosy guy. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Oh, well... Since you came this far, 
I'm not going to stop you. 
<end> 
<start>If you want to come, then come. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Come through the door. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]This is the forgotten temple that I 
found while checking out 
the network. 
<end> 
<start>There's a crapload of Magatsuhi 
stored here. 
<end> 
<start>But, it's being closely guarded by 
three demons. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]So... If you want to save that man, 
then you'll have to beat them. 
<end> 
<start>If you can do that, I'll let you inside 
the central temple. 
<end> 
<start>Good luck! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> No one's here. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You can hear [12:FF03]'s  
voice. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]That was quick. You already beat 
one!? 
<end> 
<start>So, this is the power of the 
so-called 'Demi-fiend'... Pretty 
impressive. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Alright, keep it up. I'll just kick back. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Nice work! Looks like the seals have 
been broken.  
<end> 
<start>While I'm at it, I'll show you 
the moment my Reason is 
conceived. 
<end> 
<start>Come outside. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...I can't believe it, you're actually 
doing it. 
<end> 
<start>There's no reason for you to risk 
your life for this man. 
<end> 
<start>Oh, what's the use... Keep it up, 
[12:FF01]! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]So, you beat two... You really are 
strong! 
<end> 
<start>I'm glad I'm a friend. If I was 
an enemy, I'd be dead by now. 
Hahaha... 
<end> 
<start>............ 
<end> 
<start>...Now, just one more. Don't let up 
now! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You actually beat them all! You get 
nothing out of this, you know. 
<end> 
<start>...Are you okay with being used all 
the time? 
<end> 
<start>Um, never mind. I promised to let 
you inside the central temple. 
<end> 
<start>See you there. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Come in, I'm inside. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][12:FF01].  
<end> 
<start>I feel sorry for you, so I'll tell you 
the truth. 
<end> 
<start>The truth of this world, and the truth 
of Musubi... 
<end> 
<start>Now...Come in. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]......! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]......! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Just as she said... 
<end> 
<start>...Finally, a Reason has been 
conceived. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]We need not worry. 
<end> 
<start>Lady [12:FF04] is on the move. 
<end> 
<start>Our god of Yosuga will soon 
descend upon us at Asakusa. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...Then, let us hurry. There are fools 
that we need to pass judgement on... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The demons left. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You can hear a voice coming from 
somewhere. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Will you leave the area? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> There is a Mystical Chest. 
Will you open it? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> You did not open 
the Mystical Chest. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 
[2:FF05][3:FF01][2:FF01] x [3:FF02]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You see a Cache Cube. 
Will you open it? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> You did not open 
the Cache Cube. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It's empty. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 
[2:FF05][3:FF01][2:FF01] x [3:FF02]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 
the Magatama [2:FF05][3:FF01][2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 
[2:FF05][3:FF01] Macca[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It's a trap. 
<end> 
<start>> Your party took damage. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It's empty. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> [3:FF03] found something. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]............ 
> You obtained 
[2:FF05][3:FF01][2:FF01] x [3:FF02]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It can't be used here. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The light effect wore off. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The repel effect wore off. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The attract effect wore off. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The levitation effect wore off. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Select a floor.

<start>[3:FF04][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF05][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF06][80EA] 
<start>[7:FF07]> The door is closed tight by some 
magical power. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> There is a black flame. 
<end> 
<start>> Will you put it out? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> The black flame has been put out. 
<end> 
<start>> You hear the sound of a door being 
unlocked. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The flame is already out. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The exit has disappeared. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It seems that you aren't able to use 
the terminal. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Are you a follower of Musubi? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Well, guess what? I can care less! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]All the Magatsuhi from the Amala 
Network comes from here. 
<end> 
<start>This is probably the only place with 
this much Magatsuhi. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Oh... The Magatsuhi...! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]That young man named 
[12:FF03]... 
<end> 
<start>It seems that he has gained power 
using the Magatsuhi here. 
<end> 
<start>Some demons from a rival group 
came on a reconnaissance 
mission... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Everyone here left, following a god 
called Noah. 
<end> 
<start>The young man [12:FF03] said 
something about Musubi... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]So, you're the 'Demi-fiend', eh? 
<end> 
<start>This place has got lots of Magatsuhi. 
Plus, no one else knows about it. 
<end> 
<start>That makes it the perfect place for 
[12:FF03] to summon his god. 
<end> 
<start>But first, we have to defeat the three 
gods in our way, so we can get our 
hands on the Magatsuhi. 
<end> 
<start>This is for the sake of Musubi. 
Good luck! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]So, you're the 'Demi-fiend' that's 
here to save that Hijiri? Whatever, 
man! 
<end> 
<start>Either way, you have to beat 
the three gods and get 
[12:FF03] to allow you in. 
<end> 
<start>Well, you can't trust anyone. 
Hopefully, you won't get stabbed in 
the back... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...Soon! 
<end> 
<start>[12:FF03] will soon be able to 
summon his god! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Woo-hoo!! [12:FF03] 
summoned his god! 
<end> 
<start>Now, with Musubi, we can do 
whatever we want! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Darkness is great... It's where 
the real you is being suppressed. 
<end> 
<start>Now, I can finally look face-to-face 
with my darkness without being 
bothered. 
<end> 
<start>I wanna stay like this until 
[12:FF03]'s Reason is  
conceived. Don't bother me... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Darkness is your suppressed 
desires. There's no need to be 
ashamed. Let it loose! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The god of this temple must really 
like darkness. 
<end> 
<start>It's like we're in a crypt. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Soon, we will create the world of 
Musubi. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The goddess here is a cruel woman 
who likes blood... 
<end> 
<start>She sucks the blood of intruders in 
her World of Shadows. 
<end> 
<start>Beware the shadows... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Have you been dragged into 
the World of Shadows? 
<end> 
<start>Too bad... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Not bad... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Hey! Where am I!? It hurts... Ow! 
<end> 
<start>Let me outta the World of Shadows! 
It's full of traps! It hurts... Ow! 
<end> 
<start>L-Light gets me out! But, where is 
it...? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Hey! Where am I!? It hurts... Ow! 
<end> 
<start>Let me outta the World of Shadows! 
It's full of traps! It hurts... Ow! 
<end> 
<start>...You too? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...Hey, take a hike! This is urgent! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...I see. 
<end> 
<start>Then...look for light... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I-I-I'm not afraid of shadows! 
I-I conquered it! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]That's odd. 
<end> 
<start>I passed by here already. 
<end> 
<start>I dodged all the shadows. How come 
I can't make it upstairs? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You're not that bad, beating 
the goddess here. 
<end> 
<start>I thank you on behalf of Musubi. 
Heh heh... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You'll find out soon enough which 
Reason is the greatest. 
<end> 
<start>There's plenty of Magatsuhi here. 
It's just a matter of time! 
<end> 
<start>Shijima and Yosuga are too busy 
looking for Magatsuhi. 
<end> 
<start>...Well, I've been busy here, though. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Musubi! Just awhile longer and 
the world of Musubi will arrive! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You have done well to make it here. 
<end> 
<start>Therefore, I will do you the honor 
of fighting to my fullest ability. 
<end> 
<start>...... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...Our friendship dies here. 
<end> 
<start>I side with Yosuga, 
and you with Shijima. 
<end> 
<start>We are adversaries, 
each upholding our own Reason 
and contending for creation. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...Our friendship dies here. 
<end> 
<start>I side with Yosuga, 
and you with Musubi. 
<end> 
<start>We are adversaries, 
each upholding our own Reason 
and contending for creation. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...Our friendship dies here. 
<end> 
<start>We are adversaries, 
each upholding our own Reason 
and contending for creation. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]As fate would have it, 
we are both beyond shedding tears. 
<end> 
<start>We need not hesitate 
to fight each other... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]So, let us now decide 
who is truly superior. 
Challenge me with all your might! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I salute you, powerful one. 
<end> 
<start>Because you are the paladin of 
the Reason of Yosuga, 
<end> 
<start>I shall explain to you our fate. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Our goal is to create 
a new kingdom-- 
the kingdom of Yosuga. 
<end> 
<start>However, no kingdom can be ruled 
by two kings. 
<end> 
<start>If we both were to assume authority, 
our kingdom would be doomed 
to fail. 
<end> 
<start>...Thus, our fate is to do battle 
and determine who should rightfully 
lead. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...... 
<end> 
<start>...I greatly value your friendship, 
<end> 
<start>and that will not change, 
no matter what the outcome 
of this battle. 
<end> 
<start>Because you are a true friend, 
I shall wield my strength fully. 
Surely, you feel the same... 
<end> 
<start>...So, let us now decide 
who is truly superior. 
Challenge me with all your might! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Not bad at all... 
I like your style. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]You know what? 
If we continue fighting 
and I end up killing you... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]then I'll be giving my client 
exactly what he wants. 
And that just won't do. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]So, get going... 
I won't try and stop you this time. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]I thought that if I kept on 
collecting stuff like this, 
eventually I'd hit the jackpot. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]But, plans change. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Maybe you'll have better luck 
than I did trying to get to 
the bottom of all this. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]It'd be a shame for you to die now, 
so I'll give you a little help... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]You'll need this to continue. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]It's just worthless junk 
as far as I'm concerned. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]At this point, all I care about 
is what that old geezer has 
up his sleeve. Here, take it. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 
the [2:FF02]Candelabrum of Knowledge[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]See ya, kid. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]If we both manage to stay alive, 
I'm sure we'll meet again... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Perfect. 
<end> 
<start>With this much Magatsuhi, 
there won't be any problem. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]My god will emerge from 
the infinite space beyond 
the Amala Network. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]He is outside of 
the flow of time, 
a being without a name... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]He is the god of absolute solitude. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]...But, it might be inconvenient 
for him to remain nameless. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Let's see, a drifting god... 
How about [2:FF02]Noah[2:FF01]? 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Come forth, Noah... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The voice of [12:FF03] 
can be heard... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]What do you think of my god, 
[12:FF01]? Awesome, huh? 
<end> 
<start>The world of Musubi will soon 
be here... 
<end> 
<start>No longer will people be able to 
interfere with each other's lives. 
Everyone will be happy... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]True independence will soon be 
a reality. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF06]...You, who is about to enter 
my world, show me your heart... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF06]...You have nothing in your heart. 
Not even a hint of Reason. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF06]For the one who will shape 
the world, this cannot be. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF06]Go! 
<end> 
<start>And discover yourself...

<end> 
<start>[7:FF06]...You have come at last. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF06]How can you be the one standing 
before me...? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF06]Why have you been chosen...? 
<end> 
<start>You, with a heart that follows 
no rule... The bearer of unnamed 
Reason... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF06]Your heart longs for the kingdom 
of freedom, a world that has no 
set future... 
<end> 
<start>Will you disregard the past sins 
of the world, to pursue such 
an ideal? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF06]...The Great Will once granted 
the world freedom, 
<end> 
<start>in hopes that it would evolve 
to a new level. 
<end> 
<start>However, it was that freedom which 
gave rise to evil, brought darkness, 
and led the world to destruction... 
<end> 
<start>Freedom is the seed of disaster; 
its sole fruit is ruin. 
<end> 
<start>I will not allow the world 
to be doomed to failure! 
<end> 
<start>My power was meant for one 
who sought the world's rebirth, 
upholding a worthy Reason! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF06][12:FF01], you have become 
a slave of freedom, 
like that fallen angel! 
<end> 
<start>Begone, demon! 
My light, searing with anger, 
shall wipe you from existence! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF06]How can you be the one 
standing before me...? 
<end> 
<start>Why have you been chosen...? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF06]I came into being for the creation 
of a new world, 
<end> 
<start>and those with Reasons came here 
to make their visions reality. 
<end> 
<start>Alas, their dreams were shattered, 
<end> 
<start>and the possibility of a new world 
has been crushed forever... 
<end> 
<start>...by the hand of a demon. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF06]You may have sought the power 
of creation, 
<end> 
<start>but no matter how strong 
your conviction, a demon 
can never acquire a Reason. 
<end> 
<start>Whether or not you were aware 
of that, you purged the world 
of those who sympathized with 
other philosophies of creation. 
<end> 
<start>Your body is brimming with strength, 
yet your soul is empty. 
<end> 
<start>I see before me the incarnation 
of bane itself. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF06]...Now, there is no reason 
for this world to exist. 
I shall have to wait for 
the next opportunity. 
<end> 
<start>You are responsible for the death 
of this world. I cannot forgive 
such a transgression! 
<end> 
<start>Begone, demon! 
May you be cursed eternally! 
<end> 
<start>False seeker of power, 
you are evil incarnate! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF06]So, you stand before me with 
the Reason of Shijima... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF06]So, you stand before me with 
the Reason of Musubi... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF06]So, you stand before me with 
the Reason of Yosuga... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF06]Your heart wishes for a kingdom 
that will flourish in the silence 
of time. Very well... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF06]Your heart wishes for a kingdom 
rooted in solitude. Very well... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF06]Your heart wishes for a kingdom 
which rejoices in conflict. 
Very well... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF06]The time of creation is upon you. 
<end> 
<start>Whether or not you succeed 
depends on your strength, 
bearer of Reason... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF06]I shall now unleash my light, 
the power of creation! 
<end> 
<start>Triumph over me! 
Show me the strength that will 
make the world new!! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF04]You have shown me your strength... 
Undoubtedly, you are capable of 
creating a new world. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF04]However, the true battle 
still awaits you. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF04]Creation is a battle 
without an enemy. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF04]How absurd... 
<end> 
<start>You wish for me to unleash 
my power when all Reasons 
have been forsaken? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF04]The kingdom you would create 
promises nothing but suffering... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF04]Demon... Human... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF06]Persuaded by the fallen angel, 
you destroyed the seeds of creation, 
denying the reincarnation of 
the world. 
<end> 
<start>With the cold heart of a demon, 
you rejected the possibility 
of evolution. 
<end> 
<start>By casting aside your humanity, 
you became the living incarnation 
of bane itself. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF06]Begone, accursed one! 
<end> 
<start>I shall never forgive you for causing 
the death of the world! 
<end> 
<start>My light, searing with anger, 
shall wipe you from existence! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF06]How foolish... 
<end> 
<start>What good can come of this, 
when you are tainted black...? 
<end> 
<start>...Be forewarned, 
demon who was once human. 
<end> 
<start>Though I may perish, 
your soul will never again 
be at ease. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF06]...The final hour is imminent. 
Darkness shall face justice in 
the last battle... 
<end> 
<start>You will not escape from the fire 
of judgment... 
<end> 
<start>Let fear grip your heart! 
Because of your transgressions, 
you will be cursed for all eternity! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]At last, you have restored all of 
the candelabra to their rightful 
places. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]I promised earlier that I would 
answer all of your questions, 
sparing no detail... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]It may have occurred to you that 
the candelabra were not in fact 
stolen... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]In truth, my master gave them to 
those whom he deemed worthy. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]I must apologize for not being 
honest with you, but there is 
a reason... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]If you listen to what I have to say, 
I am sure you will understand... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The forces of light and darkness 
have fought throughout the universe, 
even beyond the flow of time. 
<end> 
<start>Their battles have affected every 
living being in existence. 
<end> 
<start>Demons and humans are no 
exception; they have simply been 
cogwheels in the infernal machine 
called war. 
<end> 
<start>...And the war still rages on, 
even as we speak. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]However, one individual vowed to 
put an end to this eternal war. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]He decided to create a demon 
of chaos, one that would inherit 
his will... 
<end> 
<start>...and enter the final battle 
against the forces of light. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The Fiends were prepared for 
the creation of that demon. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]He believed that by challenging 
and overcoming death, 
<end> 
<start>the demon would become the fruit 
of destruction, the black hope 
that we awaited for so long. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...That is what he and my master 
planned. 
<end> 
<start>The Fiends and the Labyrinth of 
Amala were ordeals meant to test 
you. 
<end> 
<start>One Fiend challenged you, 
unaware of the truth, 
<end> 
<start>while another Fiend fell to you, 
dreaming of a future of chaos. 
<end> 
<start>Yes, this was all in preparation 
for the final battle... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]You have vanquished all the Fiends, 
and now you stand here, 
just as he hoped... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]A demon with the strength to 
become the champion of chaos... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:][13:FF01]... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Will you lend your strength to us, 
<end> 
<start>[18:]for the sake of all who live in 
darkness? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]If you choose to assist us, 
<end> 
<start>[18:]then we can put an end to this 
unending war. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]I cannot force you to help us. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]...If you choose to walk the path 
of a human, then there is no need 
for you to return here. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]But, if you have doubts about 
the laws of the universe... 
about fate, or the providence of 
the Absolute One... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]...then you should come to us, 
at the very bottom of the Labyrinth. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]There you shall be born again as 
a full demon, body and soul... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Let me conclude by telling you 
about a human who has crossed 
your path... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]...one who is drifting, 
being kept alive by fate. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]It is my master's wish that you listen 
before deciding upon a path to take. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]The man I am referring to 
was known as Hijiri in your 
previous world. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]He died, but as fate would have it, 
he carried on in the Vortex World. 
<end> 
<start>Think back to when you first 
met him, 
<end> 
<start>to when the Conception occurred... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...Yes, he did lose his life, 
like all the others. 
<end> 
<start>As he was heading to the hospital 
where you already were, 
the Conception began... 
and his life ended. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Did it not seem odd to you, 
<end> 
<start>that he was in the Vortex World 
unaffected, unchanged? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]It was all because of the mortal sin 
which he committed... 
<end> 
<start>He was a being toyed with by fate, 
<end> 
<start>condemned to carry the burden 
of atonement forever. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]His punishment was to see with his 
own eyes all that happens 
in the world, 
<end> 
<start>to record the balance of events 
through all the ages. 
<end> 
<start>A task as endless as scooping water 
out of the sea with a cup... 
He was condemned to wander 
the infinite span of time. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Man can change the course of his 
next life, by his karma... 
<end> 
<start>But, that privilege was taken away 
from Hijiri. 
<end> 
<start>Though his body may perish, 
his soul will remain unsaved; 
he must continue on with his task. 
<end> 
<start>He lives a cursed eternal life, 
just like a demon. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]"Watch, and record the history 
of the world... 
Witness the entirety of the endless 
war between order and chaos... 
<end> 
<start>That is your punishment for 
your unforgivable sin..." 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Do you understand now? 
<end> 
<start>By the will of Amala, 
he was given a life of torment... 
<end> 
<start>...and emerged in the Vortex World, 
without realizing that he had died. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Soon after, your paths crossed 
again... 
<end> 
<start>That is probably because you have 
the potential to affect the course 
of the new world. 
<end> 
<start>So by accompanying you, 
he has unknowingly been fulfilling 
his new destiny. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Tragically, he has no memory 
of his sin, his punishment, 
or even his death. 
<end> 
<start>He believes that he survived 
the Conception, and has acted 
accordingly. 
<end> 
<start>As for the result of his efforts... 
you already know the outcome. 
<end> 
<start>In the body of a Manikin, 
Hijiri challenged those vying 
for creation... 
<end> 
<start>...and he lost his body once again. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]He is now on a journey to 
a new land of suffering, 
<end> 
<start>[18:]but his will can never be freed, 
and his sin never redeemed... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Do you want your life to be 
predestined as well, 
or would you rather choose 
your own actions? 
<end> 
<start>[18:]If you do not wish to be ruled 
by destiny... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]If you would prefer to walk with 
demons on a new, untrodden path, 
then please come visit my master. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]You can open the door ahead with 
the candelabrum I gave you. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]...Will you come meet my master? 
<end> 
<start>I will. 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Then, we will be waiting in 
the deepest part of the Labyrinth. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]I will open the way to the last door; 
please use the candelabrum and 
come see us. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]We look forward to seeing you 
soon. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]I understand that it is difficult 
for you to make a decision 
right now. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]There is still time... 
If you decide to help my master, 
please come back to this place. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]We will wait here as long as 
the flow of Amala permits. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Until then... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][12:FF01]... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]What are you doing here? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]You came here to see me? 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Or... were you worried about 
that guy? 
<end> 
<start>I wanted to see how you're doing. 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Thanks... I really appreciate it. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]I'm just about ready to perform 
the ceremony to summon the god 
of Musubi. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]If you wanna help out, 
come to Amala Temple with me. 
It's just down this passageway. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]...Oh really? 
<end> 
<start>[18:]You're as helpful as always, 
[12:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]But, you really shouldn't 
trust people so easily... 
I'm actually helping you out here. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]That guy's coming with me... 
In fact, I better get going now. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]...Don't keep me waiting, 
alright [12:FF01]? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Heh. Maybe that's a good thing 
about you, being so gullible. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Come join me at Amala Temple. 
It's just down this passageway. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]I'll tell you all about 
his secret plans... 
and how he was using you. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> [12:FF03] disappeared. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...Hey [12:FF01], 
long time no see. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You here to help me, 
or to capture me? 
<end> 
<start>Either way, there's no point 
anymore. The [12:FF03] that 
once wandered this world aimlessly 
is dead. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The person you see before you is 
the almighty [12:FF03], 
master of Amala's power. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]To be honest with you, 
I stopped caring about others 
entirely. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]I figured out how I want 
the world to be. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]You see, there's me, 
and then there's everybody else. 
Most people don't even notice me. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]They don't care about me, 
and I don't care about them. 
<end> 
<start>That's not a bad thing, 
or a sad thing either. 
<end> 
<start>After all, only you can be 
at the center of your world, 
right? 
<end> 
<start>Then, each person should 
be allowed to create 
his or her own world... 
<end> 
<start>That is my Reason... 
the Reason of Musubi. 
<end> 
<start>...You agree, don't you? 
That it'd be nice to create 
your own world? 
<end> 
<start>Yeah, I agree. 
<start>[7:FF07]I knew you'd understand. 
You can't please everyone, 
and you really shouldn't try to. 
<end> 
<start>So yeah, I stopped blaming you 
for not helping me back then. 
<end> 
<start>...See ya, [12:FF01]. 
Give yourself some time 
to think about it... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...I had a feeling that 
you wouldn't understand. 
I guess it doesn't matter to you, 
since you're not human anymore. 
<end> 
<start>As for me, I'll prove I'm right 
by creating the world of Musubi. 
<end> 
<start>You should spend some time alone, 
[12:FF01]... 
Then, see what you think. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...I bet you've done nothing 
but waste time here 
in this Vortex World. 
<end> 
<start>Are you gonna let the world 
keep tossing you around, 
like a leaf in the wind? 
<end> 
<start>Maybe you'll come to your senses 
if you spend some time alone... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Hmmmm, so you're still alive, eh? 
<end> 
<start>You actually managed to defeat 
one of us... Very impressive. 
<end> 
<start>But, I won't be as easy as 
the white knight. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]My crimson armor shall glisten 
with your blood. 
<end> 
<start>Death be unto you, Demi-fiend!! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 
the [2:FF02]Candelabrum of Insight[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]*gasp* ...!! 
<start>[7:FF07]Dude! You scared the crap outta me, 
[12:FF01]! 
Why'd you startle me like that!? 
<end> 
<start>[18:]You come here late, 
you cause trouble... 
Geez. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Ah, forget it. 
<end> 
<start>[18:][7:FF07]I'm sure you noticed already, 
but man, this place is deserted. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]I called Ms. [11:FF02] 
and double checked, though. 
She said, "Shinjuku Medical Center." 
<end> 
<start>Maybe something happened... 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]They could've at least put up 
a notice or something, 
so visitors aren't clueless. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]This place better not be 
contaminated by some deadly 
virus... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]...How can you be so calm? 
To tell you the truth, 
I'm gettin' kinda nervous. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Don't be jealous. 
Let's just say that I know how to 
apply myself. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]What? 
No way I'm giving you her number. 
Why should I help my competition? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]I checked out most of this place. 
I don't know where else 
Ms. [11:FF02] could be... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Oh well. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]I'll go back and see how 
[12:FF04] is doing. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]She's probably all mad at me 
'cuz I've been gone so long... 
*sigh* It's hard to please 
a girl with her upbringing. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]See ya in a bit, [12:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]I really hope that this is nothing 
we should be worried about... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Woman... 
What brings you to this place? 
<end> 
<start>Why do you bear such anger? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]That power I felt... It was you? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]So, you weren't dead after all... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Were you calling out for me, 
Gozu-Tennoh...? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Ever since I fell into 
Nihilo's trap, 
my spirit has been drifting. 
<end> 
<start>But, not for one minute 
have I forgotten the rage 
that I felt on that day. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]...I sought power, 
but I failed to get it. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]No matter what trials I face, 
or how much I get hurt... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]...my Reason will not change. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]But at this rate, 
my Reason will be lost... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Woman, accept my spirit. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I once strove to protect the world 
from the followers of stillness. 
<end> 
<start>However, what we should have done 
instead was build a kingdom ruled 
by strength. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Of course, 
I would have never succeeded. 
<end> 
<start>If I was a human... 
<end> 
<start>If I could have had a Reason 
of my own, then the outcome 
may have been different. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]If your power can make me strong, 
and help me to create my world... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Your Reason is one 
with our kingdom. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I shall entrust you with 
my last remaining strength!! 
<end> 
<start>Woman, accept my spirit! 
Be the strength that guides 
all demons!! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]It's hot... 
like my hand is on fire... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Look at me, [12:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]I'm beautiful, don't you agree? 
Strength and beauty are one and 
the same. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Now, I have the power to shape 
my own destiny... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Ah, I can see! 
<end> 
<start>[18:]I can see those who seek Yosuga 
flocking to this land. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]It is within my grasp... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]My utopia... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]My ideal world...!! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Ahahahahaha... 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Oh... I wasn't expecting you, 
[12:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]My master is resting right now. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]If you're here for information, 
I'd be glad to help you. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]...Is there anything else you want 
to ask about, [12:FF01]? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]...Alright. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]I'll try to help you as much as I can. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]So, what is it that you'd like 
to know about? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]...Then, you should get going. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]I look forward to seeing you again... 
<end> 
<start>I want to ask you about something. 
<start>The Vortex World 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Okay... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Listen closely. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]...Then, you should get going. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]I look forward to seeing you again... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]I see that your quest for 
the candelabra is going well. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Those that stole the candelabra 
are unique and powerful demons... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]They are [2:FF02]Fiends[2:FF01], 
manifestations of death. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]...Now that I think about it, 
<end> 
<start>[18:]this all started because of one man 
who caused the Conception in 
the previous world. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]The Conception... Because of it, 
the Vortex World was born. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Kagutsuchi is the source of light 
and power for this world. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]You who once lived as a human 
must be wandering this world 
without any understanding. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]To show my appreciation, 
I would like to share with you 
my knowledge of the Vortex World 
and Kagutsuchi. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Kagutsuchi... It is the light 
whose sole purpose is to empower 
the one who will oversee creation. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Creation is the act of bringing 
a new world into existence, 
made possible by the annihilation 
of the old world. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Kagutsuchi will allow a life form 
of its choosing to determine 
the course of the new world. 
<end> 
<start>There must be those in Tokyo who 
yearn to be chosen by Kagutsuchi, 
in order to realize their vision. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The shape of the world to come 
depends on who is chosen, 
and what their Reason is. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]In the vast Amala Universe, 
this Vortex World is not the only 
place where creation occurs. 
<end> 
<start>Kagutsuchi rises, matures, 
and falls in countless other places. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]There are millions--no, billions 
of worlds that you are unaware of, 
and they all experience the cycle 
of death and rebirth. 
<end> 
<start>That is the way of Amala, 
as determined by the Great Will. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]With my master, I have watched how 
myriads of worlds came into being, 
how life prospered in those worlds, 
and how they fell to ruin... 
<end> 
<start>...all that time, seeking the answer 
to the unanswerable question, 
"Why is a world reborn?" 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]But now... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]We may be on the verge of finding 
the answer... 
<end> 
<start>...and it is your actions which hold 
the key. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Please retrieve the remaining 
candelabra as soon as possible, 
and then come see my master. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]My master has high hopes for you. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]The fallen angel has bestowed upon 
you great strength. Do not lose your 
life and let this gift be in vain. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The headquarters of the Gaea cult... 
<end> 
<start>This is where it all started. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]They were a group who absorbed 
all forms of doctrine, 
for they believed they could discover 
the truth from chaos. 
<end> 
<start>But even within that cult, 
he was regarded as a heretic. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Yes, I am referring to the man 
who changed your destiny... 
and that of the world. 
<end> 
<start>He firmly believed that the ideal 
cannot be found in reality, 
<end> 
<start>that it could only be brought 
about by one's own hand. 
<end> 
<start>And ultimately, he reached beyond 
the scope of mankind and plotted 
the creation of the world. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]And the reason he was able to 
make his plot a reality... 
<end> 
<start>It was all because of his discovery 
of the Scripture of Miroku, buried 
deep within the cult's library. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]A mere coincidence, 
or the hand of fate...? 
With the Scripture in his possession, 
he obtained the Wheel of Amala. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]And by deciphering the symbols 
on it, 
<end> 
<start>he learned of the Conception... 
the fated destruction of the world. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...That incident at the park 
followed shortly thereafter. 
<end> 
<start>You see... 
For creation to be possible 
after the Conception, certain 
preparations were necessary. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The demons which he summoned 
were unleashed... 
<end> 
<start>...and a bloody act of carnage 
ensued. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Exterminate all who interfere 
with his plan, 
<end> 
<start>and dispose of those who do not 
share his ideal... 
<end> 
<start>He decided to take control of 
the inevitable--the death and 
rebirth of the world. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I believe that he carried out 
the purge because he had learned 
everything. 
<end> 
<start>Knowing that destruction was 
the fate of the world, 
he acted without remorse. 
<end> 
<start>Some members of the Gaea cult 
were against him, 
and the Order of Messiah 
tried to stop him, but... 
<end> 
<start>...he eliminated both threats at once, 
with the power of his demons. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]With all opposition removed,  
he watched as the Conception 
took place, 
<end> 
<start>just as foretold in the prophecy 
of Miroku... No, just as he planned 
after unraveling the prophecy. 
<end> 
<start>The Assembly of Nihilo must have 
been created at that time as well, 
to aid him in creation. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Nevertheless, the direction of 
the new world is still undetermined. 
<end> 
<start>Will the world he envisions become 
reality, 
<end> 
<start>or will a different world be born? 
<end> 
<start>The answer to that question... 
The outcome... 
<end> 
<start>...may be decided by the actions 
you take from this point on. 
<end> 
<start>Be careful, and stray not from 
the path that you believe in... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF04]You have chosen to follow your will 
and tread the path of thorns... 
like myself. 
<start>[7:FF04]In time, your true adversary 
will appear before you. 
<start>[7:FF04]Until that day, stay strong... 
<start>[7:FF07][80EA][80EA] 
<start>[7:FF07]> [12:FF04] left. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]This is the Mantra's 
headquarters. 
<end> 
<start>We Manikins have been captured by 
them, and are being forced to 
work... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Whaddya want here!? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Dammit! I was left behind... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Arrrrrrrrrgh!!! 
I'm losing...power...... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Power... 
<end> 
<start>Power is everything!! 
The weak are too soft and 
have no right to live. 
<end> 
<start>That Momunofu lost to you because 
he was weak. It's as simple as that. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You wanna pass? 
<end> 
<start>No way, man. I don't like your face! 
<end> 
<start>So, make like the little ballerina 
that you are and spin around, and 
go back where you came from! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]We're guards known for our unity. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You're not getting past this 
[2:FF02]Great Gate[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The Mantra's most important facility 
is beyond this gate. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Yeah. We can't let you get to 
[2:FF02]Kabukicho[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]What's... going on...!? 
I'm losing...power...!! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Arrrrrrgh...... 
<end> 
<start>...I'm not... risking my life... 
...just to protect... 
this damn...gate...... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Huh? How'd you get in? 
<end> 
<start>Used the backdoor. 
<start>[7:FF07]W-What!? Intruder! 
Get him! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]W-What? You beat Momunofu? 
<end> 
<start>I-I cannot possibly be a match for 
someone as strong as you. 
<end> 
<start>Please spare me... 
Please, please, spare my life! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Ah, I have committed murder 
once again. 
<end> 
<start>I prefer not to bloody my hands, 
really. 
<end> 
<start>But, everyone attacks me out of 
jealousy all the time. 
<end> 
<start>Don't keep me locked up in here! 
Let me fight! 
<end> 
<start>I'm only here because there's plenty 
of blood here. 
<end> 
<start>I want the blood of a young man! 
Blood! I want BLOOD! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Do you really think I resort to 
violence!? 
<end> 
<start>I'm innocent! Let me out of here! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It's locked from the other side. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]This is the entrance for the plaintiff. 
<end> 
<start>You're the defendant. Enter from 
the other side. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]This is the entrance for 
the defendant. 
<end> 
<start>You've been accused by Momunofu 
of violating our law. 
<end> 
<start>Are you sure you want to subject 
yourself to the 'trial of power'? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]Then, proceed into the court. 
<end> 
<start>Two demons will enter... 
<end> 
<start>But, only one will exit. 
Here, might makes right. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Only those who believe in power 
may enter! 
<end> 
<start>Weaklings such as YOU should 
leave now! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I underestimated you 'cause 
I thought you were a human. 
<end> 
<start>But, no holding back now. 
I, Momunofu, will kick your ass! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]See? Isn't it great?! I love beating 
others into the ground! 
<end> 
<start>That's why our beliefs are based on 
power. 
<end> 
<start>You've been accepted. Go see 
Gozu-Tennoh. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]This is the Mantra's court. 
<end> 
<start>To them, power is the law. 
<end> 
<start>The weak are evil, the strong are 
just. 
<end> 
<start>Justice is served all day long 
here in this bloody chamber. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]They're crazy. The Mantra are all 
crazy! 
<end> 
<start>This court is covered in blood, and 
they say that it's not enough!? 
<end> 
<start>The stains just won't come off! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The door is locked. 
Will you unlock it? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> You unlocked the door. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The door is locked. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...Dammit! I don't like you... 
<end> 
<start>Just because Thor pardoned you, 
doesn't mean that I have. 
<end> 
<start>I'll show you that I'm stronger than 
you!! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Up ahead is our court. 
<end> 
<start>The weak need not apply. 
You'll regret it. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]That thunder ball gets us 
all riled up!! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Hey scumbag! This is jail! 
<end> 
<start>Don't do anything funny! Gots that? 
Don't do anything funny! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Ooooooooooh! 
<end> 
<start>Me no let them escape! Me guard 
here! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Me tired... Me hate this... 
Me don't care anymore... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I-I hear voices from that room 
again! 
<end> 
<start>His creepy voice! 
Yelling! Singing! Moaning! Roaring! 
<end> 
<start>Just listening to it makes me crazy! 
<end> 
<start>I'd rather be worked to the ground! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> He is not responding. 
It seems he is wrapped up in 
something. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Dammit! Let me out! This is hell! 
<end> 
<start>Getting killed just because 
the demons feel like it... 
<end> 
<start>Getting Magatsuhi sucked out of 
me... 
<end> 
<start>I don't feel like I'm living! 
Death would be much more 
comfortable! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]We're the lucky ones. 
<end> 
<start>Many of the others... 
<end> 
<start>...are taken to Kabukicho Prison... 
<end> 
<start>They're sent there to have 
Magatsuhi extracted from them. 
<end> 
<start>Excruciating torture awaits them 
there. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I heard the demons saying 
something about catching a human. 
<end> 
<start>They'll torture anyone to death, 
even humans. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I just heard some demons say that 
Momunofu was defeated. 
<end> 
<start>I can't believe someone beat 
that monster! 
<end> 
<start>Whoever did it must be a monster 
himself! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Huh? Was a human girl captured? 
<end> 
<start>We caught a guy, but haven't heard 
anything 'bout a girl. 
<end> 
<start>...Was she your 'bitch'? 
Your 'hoochie momma'? 
Such a lewd young man! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]............ 
<end> 
<start>> You are not strong enough to 
open it. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You forced the door open. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Huh? Whaddya want? 
<end> 
<start>Please join my party. 
<start>[7:FF07]Huh? You want me to join you? 
Hmmm... 
<end> 
<start>I ain't gonna join with a puny wuss 
like you. Go home to your momma. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]What?! Screw you! 
<end> 
<start>Don't go talkin' to me if you don't 
have anything to say, you dumbass! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It's really high... 
<end> 
<start>> Will you jump off? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> Are you sure? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]Hey! Wake up! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Stop sleeping! You're about to be 
escorted to court! 
<end> 
<start>A trial decided by power... 
<end> 
<start>If you claim to be innocent, then 
pound your enemy into the ground! 
<end> 
<start>When he is just a quivering mass of 
flesh, you'll be set free. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Hahahahaha...! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You can hear a voice from 
the other side... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Oh, a newcomer? 
<end> 
<start>You were probably thrown in here 
for a crime that you didn't commit, 
right? 
<end> 
<start>But, reason won't work with those 
Mantra guys! You probably figured 
that out already. 
<end> 
<start>If you want to get out of here, 
you'll have to impress them with 
your brute strength. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Let me out of here! 
<end> 
<start>The Mantra are crazy! 
<end> 
<start>I can't fight. Someone, save me! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]We're beginning the hearing. 
Get out. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]What? 
<end> 
<start>Your entrance is on the other side. 
<end> 
<start>Or, are you trying to bribe me and 
get info outta me? 
<end> 
<start>Exactly. 
<start>[7:FF07]WHAT!? I can't believe you!! 
What the hell are you thinking!? 
<end> 
<start>You need to pay up before I spill 
the beans! 
<end> 
<start>C'mon, before anyone comes! 
Gimme 200 Macca... 
<end> 
<start>Pay up. 
<start>[7:FF07]Alright... Now, listen up! 
<end> 
<start>The way we handle disputes is with 
[2:FF02]three battles[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>If you lose even once, you're [2:FF02]dead[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>You better make sure that you're 
[2:FF02]prepared[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...What? You want me to tell you 
more? 
<end> 
<start>Then gimme another 200 Macca. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Okay, then... I'll tell you a couple'a 
things 'bout your opponents. 
<end> 
<start>First off, there's a demon that's 
strong against Force attacks. 
Its weakness is [2:FF02]Elec attacks[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>Next, is a demon that uses 
Elec attacks. Its weakness is... 
[2:FF02]Ice or Fire[2:FF01], one of those. 
<end> 
<start>And lastly, there's a fire demon. 
Make sure to use [2:FF02]ice attacks[2:FF01] to win. 
<end> 
<start>That's all the info I have, corky! 
Hurry up and get along before 
someone finds us. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Okay, then... I'll tell you some things 
about your opponents. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]First off... 
<end> 
<start>......! 
<start>[7:FF07]Hey, what're you doing!? 
<end> 
<start>You're not up to shenanigans, 
are you? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]N-No, I'm not! 
<end> 
<start>This guy... That's it! 
This guy got lost, so I was tellin' 
him off! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Hmmm... Is that so... 
Well, alright then... 
<end> 
<start>............ 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Phew! That was a close one. 
<end> 
<start>I didn't notice him sneaking up, 
since he doesn't have footsteps. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...Alright, let's continue. It was about 
your opponent, right? 
<end> 
<start>Your first opponent is a demon that 
uses [2:FF02]fire[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>You know what fire's weak against, 
right? 
<end> 
<start>The next is a lady that uses attacks 
with [2:FF02]Force[2:FF01]. And you know what? 
She's hot!! 
<end> 
<start>Maybe there'll be some [2:FF02]electricity[2:FF01] 
between you two! 
<end> 
<start>And lastly... 
<end> 
<start>The Mantra's number two. 
His [2:FF02]lightning[2:FF01] packs quite a punch! 
So, look out! 
<end> 
<start>Bad news about that guy is that 
he has [2:FF02]no weaknesses[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>............ 
<end> 
<start>...That's all the info I have. 
<end> 
<start>Hurry up and get ready. 
The door's over there. 
...Hope he doesn't suspect me. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Then, hurry up and head for 
the other door. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]What? Forgot already? 
<end> 
<start>...Gimme a break, man. 
<end> 
<start>Okay... The hearing is made up 
of [2:FF02]three battles[2:FF01]. You need to 
[2:FF02]be prepared[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>Your first opponent is a demon that 
uses [2:FF02]fire[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>You know what fire's weak against, 
right? 
<end> 
<start>The next is a lady that uses attacks 
with [2:FF02]Force[2:FF01]. And you know what? 
She's hot!! 
<end> 
<start>Maybe there'll be some [2:FF02]electricity[2:FF01] 
between you two! 
<end> 
<start>And lastly... 
<end> 
<start>The Mantra's number two. 
His [2:FF02]lightning[2:FF01] packs quite a punch! 
So, look out! 
<end> 
<start>Bad news about that guy is that 
he has [2:FF02]no weaknesses[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>............ 
<end> 
<start>...That's all the info I have. 
<end> 
<start>Hurry up and get ready. 
The door's over there. 
...Hope he doesn't suspect me. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Hey! You don't have the cash! 
Stop messin' with me! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...Shit! 
<end> 
<start>They found me out and tossed me in 
here. 
<end> 
<start>Hey, who's my opponent? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]We will now hold a hearing 
according to the rules of the Mantra. 
<end> 
<start>I call upon the defendant, 
[13:FF01]. Please come to 
the arena. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][13:FF01]... 
You are charged with loitering 
in Ikebukuro and entering our 
headquarters. 
<end> 
<start>On top of that, demons saw you in 
the Great Underpass. You may be 
a Nihilo spy... 
<end> 
<start>I further charge you with being 
a little sneak. Ikebukuro is 
the territory of the Mantra! 
<end> 
<start>Even if you are a newcomer, it is 
crime enough that you've shown us 
such flagrant disrespect! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]It's finally time... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I SHALL PASS RIGHTEOUS 
JUDGEMENT... 
<end> 
<start>CAPITAL PUNISHMENT! 
THERE IS NO OTHER CHOICE. 
<end> 
<start>THINK OF HOW YOU WANT TO DIE. 
I'LL GIVE YOU TIME. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I SEE YOU ARE READY. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Are you ready? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]Just beating Orthrus isn't going to 
overturn the decision. 
<end> 
<start>Your sentence is death... 
Ahh... I want to cut you up right now! 
<end> 
<start>But, I'll give you some time. 
Make it fun for me. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Is it okay, now? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I am Thor. 
<end> 
<start>I commend your ability to fight. 
<end> 
<start>But... 
<end> 
<start>Will your power work against me? 
<end> 
<start>My hammer shall be the judge. 
<end> 
<start>I will give you time to prepare. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Now... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Show me your strength! 
<start>[7:FF07]............ 
<end> 
<start>You have done well. 
<end> 
<start>It seems that you have something 
other demons do not. 
<end> 
<start>...Go and see [2:FF02]Gozu-Tennoh[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>Our leader, Gozu-Tennoh, aims to 
build a utopia where only the strong 
may live. 
<end> 
<start>Gozu-Tennoh is at the top of this 
building. 
<end> 
<start>Your power may change the world. 
Remember that. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...This is for keeping me interested. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained the Magatama 
[2:FF03]Narukami[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Judge, [13:FF01] is 
innocent. I give my word. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Huh!? Innocent? 
...O-Okay!! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...I-I have... reached a verdict... 
<end> 
<start>By the order of Thor... 
No, out of respect for your power, 
[13:FF01]... 
<end> 
<start>...I hereby declare you innocent! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...This court is adjourned! 
The defendant may now be 
released! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Oh, so it's your turn? 
<end> 
<start>If you want, I can tell you who you're 
fighting today! 
<end> 
<start>500 should do the trick! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Now you're talking! 
<end> 
<start>Okay... The first battle is just  
to test your skills. It's still 
a humongous beast, though. 
<end> 
<start>That guy will probably burn you 
to ashes with his breath! 
<end> 
<start>Even if you win, you'll still  
have to face a blood-thirsty 
demon next. 
<end> 
<start>She's got defense, but more 
importantly, she packs 
a wallop of a punch! 
<end> 
<start>I'm sure you'll want to finish it 
fast, but it probably won't end 
the way you're hoping. 
<end> 
<start>Last is the judge himself! 
<end> 
<start>If you can withstand his 
lightning attacks, you'll be 
a free man. 
<end> 
<start>Well, that about does it. 
I don't think you'll win, 
but good luck anyways. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Will you pay 500? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]I don't got time for 
starvin' demons. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I knew you would be here... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Gozu-Tennoh has... 
<end> 
<start>No... The Mantra has been utterly 
destroyed by Nihilo's attack. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...The Assembly of Nihilo had 
a higher goal than just ruling over 
Tokyo. 
<end> 
<start>We, on the other hand, did nothing 
more than enforce a reign of terror. 
...That is the reason we lost. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]And all those that we called 
comrades have deserted us. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...You had a friend who was being 
held prisoner here, did you not? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Both of you are free to do whatever 
you want... 
<end> 
<start>I have no business here anymore. 
<end> 
<start>There is no point in guarding 
an abandoned city. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...Farewell. 
<end> 
<start>I will go on a quest to realize 
my dream of a world where 
the strong thrive. 
<end> 
<start>If you are truly strong, then we shall 
meet again... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]......! 
<end> 
<start>[18:][12:FF01]! 
So you're here...ugh...! 
<end> 
<start>[18:]...Damn those demons. How long do 
they plan to keep me locked up? 
<end> 
<start>[18:]I heard the news. You won the trial 
by combat, huh? 
<end> 
<start>[18:]I've managed to stay alive, too... 
Well, sorta. I don't think they'll kill 
me just yet. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]I'm gonna find a way out, but I need 
some more time. My back's still 
sore, so... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Oh yeah! Ms. [11:FF02]! 
I heard about her! 
<end> 
<start>[18:]You know Nihilo has that Maiden, 
right? That's Ms. [11:FF02]! 
<end> 
<start>[18:]There's no time to lose! 
<end> 
<start>[18:]The Mantra are about to launch 
a full-scale attack on Nihilo! 
<end> 
<start>[18:]If she's caught... She'll be killed! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:][12:FF01]! You gotta 
save her! 
<end> 
<start>[18:]You can do it with your powers, 
right?! 
<end> 
<start>[18:]I can't do anything... 
Please, [12:FF01]! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]I'm counting on you, 
[12:FF01]! 
Save Ms. [11:FF02]! 
<end> 
<start>[18:]I'm powerless... but I know you can 
do it! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]...Yo, [12:FF01]. 
It's been a while... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]I heard about you... even from 
this cell. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]You participated in the attack on 
Nihilo, huh? 
<end> 
<start>[18:]...Did you know that 
Ms. [11:FF02] is the Maiden? 
That's what I wanted to tell you 
when I got caught, but... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]...Either way, it doesn't look like 
you brought her back... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]...Hey [12:FF01], 
you're back... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Ms. [11:FF02] isn't with you, 
is she...? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Damn, even you couldn't pull 
through... I was counting on that 
demonic power of yours... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]The Mantra's finished, Nihilo's 
gaining ground... and we still have 
no idea where our teacher is... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]What the hell are we doing, 
wandering around in this 
godforsaken world...? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]...I guess I have to place my bets on 
that guy. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]I heard a rumor about this incredible 
Manikin. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]They say he can see the future... 
He actually predicted the fall of 
the Mantra. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Maybe he can tell us about 
Ms. [11:FF02]... and what 
we should do from here. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]The last thing I heard was that 
he was taken to prison, so he's 
probably still there. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]I'm gonna head off to Kabukicho 
and look for him. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]There's no place where I can be 
safe... So, I'll take my chances. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Lates. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> [12:FF03] left. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Only the select few deserve to live. 
Don't you agree? 
<end> 
<start>Of course. 
<start>[7:FF07]I like your attitude. 
You can have this. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained [2:FF05]1000[2:FF01] Macca. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Do not stray away from your belief... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Only the select few deserve to live. 
<end> 
<start>Keep that in mind... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...Hmph, what a bore. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I just wanted to test you. 
Please don't get angry... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Only the select few deserve to live. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Will you leave the area? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> There is a Mystical Chest. 
Will you open it? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> You did not open 
the Mystical Chest. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 
[2:FF05][3:FF01][2:FF01] x [3:FF02]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You see a Cache Cube. 
Will you open it? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> You did not open 
the Cache Cube. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It's empty. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 
[2:FF05][3:FF01][2:FF01] x [3:FF02]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 
the Magatama [2:FF05][3:FF01][2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 
[2:FF05][3:FF01] Macca[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It's a trap. 
<end> 
<start>> Your party took damage. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It's empty. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> [3:FF03] found something. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]............ 
> You obtained 
[2:FF05][3:FF01][2:FF01] x [3:FF02]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It can't be used here. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The light effect wore off. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The repel effect wore off. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The attract effect wore off. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The levitation effect wore off. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Select a floor. 
<end> 
<start>[3:FF01][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF02][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF03][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF04][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF05][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF06][80EA] 
<start>[7:FF07]> Will you return to Ikebukuro? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> You sense a strong power from 
beyond the door. 
<end> 
<start>> Will you enter? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> The door is closed tight. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]............ 
<end> 
<start>I was caught again... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Go Nihilo! 
<end> 
<start>...That's what I feel like yelling 
right now. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Are you with the Mantra? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]Really? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I knew it! 
<end> 
<start>It's back to having Magatsuhi 
squeezed outta me... 
<end> 
<start>It was such a short-lived 
happiness... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> There is no one in the jail cell. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I'm a Nihilo demon... 
I was caught spying. 
<end> 
<start>I'll tell ya somethin' good! 
<end> 
<start>The Mantra keeps something 
real valuable behind the door in 
the back. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]If you're caught by the Mantra, 
you'll either be thrown in this jail, 
or sent to prison. 
<end> 
<start>They drain the Magatsuhi out of you 
at the prison. It's bad. It's torture. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I can't believe my sex appeal didn't 
work... 
<end> 
<start>The Mantra can't appreciate 
true beauty! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]It seems that the Mantra are finally 
set on destroying the Nihilo. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Do you know? 
<end> 
<start>A demon just won his case, 
and was set free. 
<end> 
<start>I hear he was young, but I'm sure 
he's a freak. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]If the Mantra beat Nihilo... 
<end> 
<start>...I might have to share my cell with 
a demon. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]D-Don't get near me! 
<end> 
<start>I-I'll shoot! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]This gate leads to [2:FF02]Kabukicho[2:FF01], 
where we take prisoners to be 
tortured. 
<end> 
<start>Gozu-Tennoh has ordered that 
no one is to pass. 
<end> 
<start>Go away. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You're the demon that Thor 
pardoned!? 
<end> 
<start>...Then, go see Gozu-Tennoh. 
He's probably waiting for you 
on the top floor. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Why!? 
<end> 
<start>Didn't we beat Nihilo!? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You the demon who won the trial? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You used physical attacks, huh? 
<end> 
<start>I mean, you can deal major damage 
if you get a critical hit. 
<end> 
<start>Well... if your attack hits, that is. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Then, screw you. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Wha...... 
<end> 
<start>What the hell!? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]So, you're the young demon that 
Thor accepted? 
<end> 
<start>I've become your fan. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Arrrrrrgh! 
<end> 
<start>That woman... 
<end> 
<start>This is the doing of that human 
woman of Nihilo!! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...Let me tell you something, punk... 
<end> 
<start>Just because Thor accepted you 
doesn't mean that I have! 
<end> 
<start>I'll show you that I'm stronger than 
you!! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Oh... It's you, the one who won 
the trial. 
<end> 
<start>Gozu-Tennoh is on the top floor. 
<end> 
<start>You can use the elevator just past 
the fighting arena to meet him. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Finally, we have orders to attack 
Nihilo. 
<end> 
<start>You're going, right? 
Everyone already left. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The Mantra are done for... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Guess it's your turn to fight, huh? 
<end> 
<start>I don't wanna be locked up in here... 
I wanna fight! 
<end> 
<start>I want the blood of a young man! 
Blood! I want BLOOD! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Oh, you got out? 
<end> 
<start>It's good being young. 
<end> 
<start>I want the blood of a young man! 
Blood! I want BLOOD! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Why do I have to fight!? 
<end> 
<start>I'm innocent! Let me out of here! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Oh... It's you. 
<end> 
<start>...Even if I win, I'll be sent to 
Kabukicho... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The cell door is closed tight. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]There's a [2:FF02]human kid[2:FF01] locked away in 
a jail cell down below. 
<end> 
<start>Humans are a great source of 
Magatsuhi, but it's hard not to kill 
such a weakling. 
<end> 
<start>...Check him out sometime. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]What's wrong!? What's going on!? 
<end> 
<start>...Hey, the prisoners are escaping! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The losers of the trial are inside 
the Pretas' bellies. 
<end> 
<start>And, I clean up after them... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The Mantras went to attack Nihilo. 
<end> 
<start>There won't be any trials for a while. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The Pretas here got hungry and left. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Grr...gehhh...... 
...Gehhhhhh...... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Me want... Me want eat... 
More losers... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Gehhhhhhh...... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Me... hungry... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Forget this gatekeeping shit... 
<end> 
<start>My partner's already left... 
<end> 
<start>I let that human kid go to 
Kabukicho Prison... 
<end> 
<start>I just don't care anymore... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...Let me tell you something, punk... 
<end> 
<start>Just because Thor accepted you 
doesn't mean that I have! 
<end> 
<start>I'll show you that I'm stronger than 
you!! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Dang! 
<end> 
<start>They found out about me leaking 
info to you, and tossed me in here. 
<end> 
<start>Hey, can you tell me who's my 
opponent? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Ah... Mr. Demon. 
<end> 
<start>Please save [2:FF02]Futomimi[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>I feel like I'm free, but our leader is 
still locked up. 
<end> 
<start>Futomimi, who leads us with 
prophecies, is still being held 
captive... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Kabukicho Prison! 
<end> 
<start>Futomimi is being held captive at 
Kabukicho Prison! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Awoooo! 
<end> 
<start>Me no care about weaklings. 
<end> 
<start>Orthrus and Yaksini lost. 
They weak. 
<end> 
<start>Me no care for them! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]G...rrr...rr... 
<end> 
<start>Where... Gozu-Tennoh...? 
<end> 
<start>...Why... he no save... us...? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I heard some demons in Nihilo can 
cast deadly curses, and plague their 
enemies with ailments. 
<end> 
<start>...The wrong match-up, and you're 
dead in one hit... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I just wanted to wreak havoc! 
<end> 
<start>I don't care about Gozu-Tennoh! 
<end> 
<start>I'm not taking this anymore! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]What? What? 
<end> 
<start>I'm not Gozu-Tennoh, you know! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Huh? Huh? 
The Matra are attacking Nihilo? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Really? Really? 
We're free? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]We're worked into the dirt by 
the Mantra. 
<end> 
<start>Please don't eat us. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]With the Mantra demons gone, I get 
to forget the pains of the world for 
a while. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Please free Futomimi. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Welcome to the citadel of Yosuga... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Did you know? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I see... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]H-How did you know!? 
Are you a master of clairvoyance? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I hear there are [2:FF02]two men[2:FF01] struggling 
for Magatsuhi, using the terminals. 
<end> 
<start>They must be fond of terminals, 
I reckon... 
<end> 
<start>Quite amusing, if I do say so myself. 
After all, the world will soon be 
Yosuga's. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Lady [12:FF04] will be the one 
to create the world. 
<end> 
<start>Her Reason, Yosuga, is the most 
refined. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Come to think of it... 
<end> 
<start>There's a demon at Kabukicho 
claiming to be an [2:FF02]Emperor[2:FF01]... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...That's what I hear. 
<end> 
<start>The world only needs demons of 
Yosuga... Quite annoying. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...That's what I used to hear, but 
not recently. 
<end> 
<start>Someone must have sent him to 
burning hell. Good riddance. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Only the select few deserve to live. 
Don't you agree? 
<end> 
<start>Of course. 
<start>[7:FF07]I like your attitude. 
You can have this. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained [2:FF05]1000[2:FF01] Macca. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Do not stray away from your belief... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Only the select few deserve to live. 
<end> 
<start>Keep that in mind... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...Hmph, what a bore. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I just wanted to test you. 
Please don't get angry... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Only the select few deserve to live. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Can a girl like [12:FF04] 
create a new world...? 
<end> 
<start>...But, since I agree with 
the Reason of Yosuga, 
I shall protect her. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Yosuga, a world where only 
the strong survive... 
<end> 
<start>...What a splendid idea! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]This used to be a jail. 
<end> 
<start>Hmph... Yosuga needs no jails! 
<end> 
<start>Why, you ask? ...Because the weak 
will die. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The Yosuga demons went to 
the Obelisk to climb the Tower of 
Kagutsuchi. 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> Add Candelabrum of Foundation 
to inventory? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]What do you want to do? 
<end> 
<start>Black Visor flag on 
<start>Black Visor 
<start>[7:FF07]> There is a huge pedestal. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You do not have a candelabrum 
for this pedestal... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The switch has been activated. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Will you light the [2:FF02]Candelabrum 
of Foundation[2:FF01]? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> You lit the [2:FF02]Candelabrum 
of Foundation[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You did not light the candelabrum. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The candelabrum has been lit... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The flames illuminate the passage 
beyond. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Please retrieve the next set 
of Candelabra and return them 
to the Labyrinth. 
<end> 
<start>We are deeply grateful for 
your work. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The voice of the lady in black 
can be heard through the peephole... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The lady's voice could no longer 
be heard. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The hole is blocked... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The path is blocked... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> There is a shaft leading downward. 
<end> 
<start>> Jump in? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Return to the entrance 
of the Labyrinth? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> There is a peephole... 
<end> 
<start>> Will you look through it? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> There is a switch. 
Will you activate it? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> There is a tombstone without 
a name on it... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Will you put on the Black Visor? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The inscription on the tombstone 
changed. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The inscription on the tombstone 
remained the same. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> "Record of Forneus: 
Defeated in [3:FF01] turn(s)." 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> "Record of Forneus: 
Defeated in [2:FF02][3:FF01][2:FF01] turn(s)." 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It is inscribed, 
"Here lies Forneus." 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You recall the battle against 
Forneus... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> "Record of Troll: 
Defeated in [3:FF01] turn(s)." 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> "Record of Troll: 
Defeated in [2:FF02][3:FF01][2:FF01] turn(s)." 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It is inscribed, 
"Here lies Troll." 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You recall the battle against 
Troll... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> "Record of Orthrus: 
Defeated in [3:FF01] turn(s)." 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> "Record of Orthrus: 
Defeated in [2:FF02][3:FF01][2:FF01] turn(s)." 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It is inscribed, 
"Here lies Orthrus." 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You recall the battle against 
Orthrus... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> "Record of Yaksini: 
Defeated in [3:FF01] turn(s)." 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> "Record of Yaksini: 
Defeated in [2:FF02][3:FF01][2:FF01] turn(s)." 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It is inscribed, 
"Here lies Yaksini." 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You recall the battle against 
Yaksini... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]It's natural for every living thing 
to die... Treatment, therefore, 
contradicts nature. 
<end> 
<start>So... Did you come here to defy 
nature and be treated? 
<end> 
<start>No. 
<start>[7:FF07]Good. One lives, one dies... 
That's the way it should be. 
<end> 
<start>I pray that you find rest soon. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...I am a doctor, after all. 
I'll treat your wounds. 
<end> 
<start>But, I'm gonna charge you 
[3:FF01] Macca. Alright? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> ...... 
<end> 
<start>> Dr. Dark healed your party. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...... 
<end> 
<start>Money first. Get outta here. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Hey, are you having difficulties? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Really...? Lucky you... *sigh* 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Yeah, I thought so. Same here. 
<end> 
<start>...If you give me some Macca, 
I'll tell you what I know. 
How about it? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...No money to spare? That's okay, 
I don't have any either... *sigh* 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Really!? I appreciate it. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You gave him 2000 Macca. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...Next time you're on the floor 
above, pay attention to the ceiling. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Grrrrr... 
Are you a human, or a demon? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I hate humans. They're so cruel... 
<end> 
<start>Don't come near me! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I'm Kamala. I like demons. 
They're my friends. 
<end> 
<start>Come see me anytime. 
I'll tell you all about the [2:FF02]Fiends[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>I'm a human. 
<start>[7:FF07]Hey, you're back! 
I have something important 
to tell you. Wanna hear it? 
<end> 
<start>There are these Fiends that stole 
treasures from this Labyrinth, 
<end> 
<start>and they ran away to somewhere 
called the Vortex World. 
<end> 
<start>I hope that helps! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Hey, you're back! 
I have something important 
to tell you. Wanna hear it? 
<end> 
<start>Um, I sense the presence of a Fiend 
in... [2:FF02]a city with a tall, tall building[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>So, I think you should stay away 
from there. 
<end> 
<start>I hope that helps! 
<end> 
<start>Um, I sense the presence of a Fiend 
on... [2:FF02]a highway near a tall building[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...Huh? Wait, there's another one... 
<end> 
<start>It's on [2:FF02]a highway near a tall building[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>I think you're better off 
avoiding that place. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...Huh? Wait, there's another one... 
<end> 
<start>It's [2:FF02]underneath Yurakucho[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>I wouldn't go there, if I were you. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...Huh? Wait, there's another one... 
<end> 
<start>Uh oh, this one's coming after you. 
<end> 
<start>You'd better watch out! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...Huh? Wait, there's another one... 
<end> 
<start>It's in [2:FF02]a large underground passage[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>I wouldn't go there, if I were you. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...Huh? Wait, there's another one... 
<end> 
<start>It's in [2:FF02]a hospital in Shinjuku[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>I wouldn't go there, if I were you. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...Huh? Wait, there's another one... 
<end> 
<start>It's on [2:FF02]an underground road 
in Asakusa that leads to a park[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>I wouldn't go there, if I were you. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...Huh? Wait, there's another one... 
<end> 
<start>It's on [2:FF02]the west side of Yoyogi Park[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>I wouldn't go there, if I were you. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...Huh? Wait, there's another one... 
<end> 
<start>It's [2:FF02]underneath Yurakucho[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>I wouldn't go there, if I were you. 
<end> 
<start>Let's see... 
<end> 
<start>I don't think there are any Fiends 
around right now. 
<end> 
<start>So, it's safe to walk around! 
<end> 
<start>Um, there's a Fiend that's coming 
after you. 
<end> 
<start>He's looking for you in different 
cities. 
<end> 
<start>Don't let him catch you off-guard! 
<end> 
<start>Um, I sense the presence of a Fiend 
in... [2:FF02]a large underground passage[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>Um, I sense the presence of a Fiend 
in... [2:FF02]a hospital in Shinjuku[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>Um, I sense the presence of a Fiend 
on... [2:FF02]an underground road 
in Asakusa that leads to a park[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...Huh? Wait a minute. 
<end> 
<start>I sense one in [2:FF02]the Third Kalpa 
of this Labyrinth[2:FF01] too. 
<end> 
<start>Be careful, okay? 
<end> 
<start>Um, I sense the presence of a Fiend 
in... [2:FF02]the Third Kalpa of this Labyrinth[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>I think you should stay away 
from there. 
<end> 
<start>But, something's kinda weird... 
This one feels different than 
the others. I wonder why? 
<end> 
<start>Um, I sense the presence of a Fiend 
on... [2:FF02]the west side of Yoyogi Park[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>Um, I sense the presence of 
a Fiend... [2:FF02]underneath Yurakucho[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>You know what? 
I think all the Fiends are gone. 
That means... 
<end> 
<start>You don't have to worry about them 
anymore! Yay! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]WELCOME, MIGHTY DEMON. 
LONG HAVE I WAITED FOR ONE 
SUCH AS YOU. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]NOW, COME TO MY MASTER. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]HOWEVER, YOU ARE NOT YET 
STRONG ENOUGH. 
<end> 
<start>YOU MUST OVERCOME ALL 
DEATHS, AND ATTAIN 
ULTIMATE STRENGTH. 
<end> 
<start>IT IS THEN THAT YOU WILL 
RETURN TO ME. 
<end> 
<start>I WILL BE WAITING... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Cerberus left... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Gee, you look worn out. 
<end> 
<start>Would you like to rest for a while? 
Only 500 Macca! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Oh... Well, please come again! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Oh, you don't have enough Macca... 
Come back when you do. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You must be thirsty. 
Here, have a drink... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Your party recovered. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Go ahead, have some more... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Are you feeling better? 
Here's some more... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Your party recovered some more. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...Have... another... drink... 
<start>[7:FF07]> Your wallet feels really light... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Will you leave the area? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> There is a Mystical Chest. 
Will you open it? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> You did not open 
the Mystical Chest. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 
[2:FF05][3:FF01][2:FF01] x [3:FF02]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You see a Cache Cube. 
Will you open it? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> You did not open 
the Cache Cube. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It's empty. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 
[2:FF05][3:FF01][2:FF01] x [3:FF02]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 
the Magatama [2:FF05][3:FF01][2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 
[2:FF05][3:FF01] Macca[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It's a trap. 
<end> 
<start>> Your party took damage. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It's empty. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> [3:FF03] found something. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]............ 
> You obtained 
[2:FF05][3:FF01][2:FF01] x [3:FF02]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It can't be used here. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The light effect wore off. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The repel effect wore off. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The attract effect wore off. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The levitation effect wore off. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Select a floor. 
<end> 
<start>[3:FF01][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF02][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF03][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF04][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF05][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF06][80EA] 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]This is the [2:FF02]Labyrinth of Amala[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>It is a world completely different 
from the Vortex World which you 
came from. 
<end> 
<start>It is divided into several regions 
called [2:FF02]Kalpa[2:FF01], and at the very bottom 
resides our master, the ruler 
of chaos... 
<end> 
<start>If your wish is to pursue the path 
of creation as a human... 
then there is no reason for you to 
stay here long. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]A human's soul can learn, 
but his body is mortal. 
A demon is immortal, 
but his soul never changes. 
<end> 
<start>...I wonder how it is for you, 
since you're both human and 
demon... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]There is no place in the Labyrinth 
where you can rest. 
<end> 
<start>The demons are all here for 
a [2:FF02]certain reason[2:FF01], 
so I doubt they'll join you. 
<end> 
<start>Prepare yourself well if you don't 
want to die. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]"On the day we fell from heaven, 
time came to a halt for us... 
<end> 
<start>It remains unchanging, 
like the still of the night. 
<end> 
<start>We demons await the master's 
words, his proclamation of a new 
beginning..." 
<end> 
<start>That's what a demon I met earlier 
told me, but I have no idea what 
it means. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...I'm glad you made it here. 
<end> 
<start>...If you get stronger, 
<end> 
<start>...I'll sell you something special. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...I've got nothing else 
to sell you. 
...Hey, don't worry. 
<end> 
<start>I'm sure there are other brokers 
besides me in this Labyrinth. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...You're pretty strong. 
<end> 
<start>...I'll sell you something special. 
Interested? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...On second thought, 
forget what I just said. 
<end> 
<start>The demon you have there... 
Yeah, the one that's kinda red 
and has long eyes... 
<end> 
<start>As long as you've got that demon 
with you, I can't sell you mine. 
Come back after you get rid of it. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...You're pretty strong. 
<end> 
<start>I'll sell you something special. 
<end> 
<start>Uh... Wait a minute, 
your party's full. 
<end> 
<start>If you want a new companion, 
make some room first and then 
come back. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Here's what I'm selling... 
<end> 
<start>...a demon that can see through 
anything. With this guy around, 
any maze is a piece of cake. 
<end> 
<start>It'll be a perfect companion when 
exploring a new area. 
<end> 
<start>I'm asking 15000 Macca. 
I know it's kinda high, 
but it's well worth the price... 
So, you want it? 
<end> 
<start>Alright, I'll buy it. 
<start>[7:FF07]Excellent choice! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You purchased a demon from 
the Shady Broker. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...I-I... Pisaca!! 
<end> 
<start>Nice... m-meet... you... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The demon is quivering... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]That's fine. 
If you change your mind, 
feel free to come back anytime. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Hey hey hey, you don't have 
enough Macca. 
<end> 
<start>Come back when you have more 
money, okay? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You're an outsider, aren't ya? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...I can tell just by looking at you. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...The Labyrinth of Amala is like 
a reverse world to most newcomers. 
<end> 
<start>All things have a front and a back, 
and only by knowing both sides 
can you fully understand them. 
<end> 
<start>The truth of this world can only 
be discovered at the very bottom 
of the Labyrinth. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Have you noticed the writing 
on the tombstones? 
<end> 
<start>It's inscribed as the demons are 
killed by you-know-who... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You need a [2:FF02]key[2:FF01] to open this vault. 
<end> 
<start>I dunno about the vault on 
the other side, though. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Read the writing on the tombstones 
while wearing the [2:FF02]Black Visor[2:FF01]... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Hey, are you having difficulties? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Really...? Lucky you... *sigh* 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Yeah, I thought so. Same here. 
<end> 
<start>...If you give me some Macca, 
I'll tell you what I know. 
How about it? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...No money to spare? That's okay, 
I don't have any either... *sigh* 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Really!? I appreciate it. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You gave him 10000 Macca. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...Next time you're on the floor 
above, pay attention to the ceiling. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The door is locked... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You used the [2:FF02]Moon Key[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> There is a shaft leading downward. 
<end> 
<start>> Jump in? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> There is a shaft leading upward. 
<end> 
<start>> Jump in? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The path is blocked... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> There is a tombstone without 
a name on it... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Do me a favor... 
<end> 
<start>Don't bother me... 
<end> 
<start>My pleasure. 
<start>[7:FF07]...... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...... 
<end> 
<start>...Then, give me 10000 Macca. 
If you don't like it, then go 
somewhere else. So, do you want 
me to help you or not? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> ...... 
<end> 
<start>> Dr. Dark healed your party. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]A riot broke out yesterday at Yoyogi 
Park, regarding the construction of 
a communications tower. 
<end> 
<start>The demonstration got out of hand, 
and there have been several deaths 
and injuries reported. 
<end> 
<start>Also, [2:FF02]Hikawa[2:FF01], the top 
executive of Cybers Communication, 
is still missing. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The news continues... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Now, for the latest in sports, 
we move over to Mannaka! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Now, for the latest in 
entertainment, we move over 
to Ashimoto! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]And now, over to Kei for 
the latest in sports! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Stay tuned to see what the weather 
forecast has planned. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> No one is here. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You have no business here. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Yoyogi Park is sealed off. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> There is a note on the door. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]"The entrance to the annex is 
closed. Please use the entrance 
to the main building." 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Hey, hey! Yoyogi Park's all closed 
off, 'cause there was a riot. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Will you leave the area? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> There is a Mystical Chest. 
Will you open it? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> You did not open 
the Mystical Chest. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 
[2:FF05][3:FF01][2:FF01] x [3:FF02]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You see a Cache Cube. 
Will you open it? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> You did not open 
the Cache Cube. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It's empty. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 
[2:FF05][3:FF01][2:FF01] x [3:FF02]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 
the Magatama [2:FF05][3:FF01][2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 
[2:FF05][3:FF01] Macca[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It's a trap. 
<end> 
<start>> Your party took damage. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It's empty. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> [3:FF03] found something. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]............ 
> You obtained 
[2:FF05][3:FF01][2:FF01] x [3:FF02].

<start>[3:FF04][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF05][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF06][80EA] 
<start>[7:FF07]> Message Test. 
Next are the choices... 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]Yes, you say? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]No, you say? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The riot at Yoyogi Park? 
<end> 
<start>Oh, you mean that thing they're 
showing on TV? 
<end> 
<start>It doesn't seem real to me! 
I feel like this riot happened 
in another world or something... 
<end> 
<start>Well, I don't really have anything 
to do with it anyway. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You can overhear a couple's 
conversation. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Did you hear about the riot?! 
Three people died, right??? 
Eeek! I'm so scared!! 
<end> 
<start>You're such a scaredy-cat! 
C'mon, baby, every night we 
start our own 'riot of love'! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You're such a pervert! 
But, I love that about you!! 
*giggle* 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Oh hey, [12:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>You said you were going to visit 
Ms. [11:FF02] today, right? 
<end> 
<start>Just because she's beautiful, 
don't go doing weird things to her, 
okay!? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Due to investigations, the [2:FF02]entrances 
to Yoyogi Park[2:FF01] have been closed off. 
<end> 
<start>We ask for your cooperation. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> There is a live report 
going on... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I feel that the demonstrators' 
actions were out of line... 
<end> 
<start>But, even I can't forgive Cybers 
Communication for destroying 
the park for their own profits! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The reporter's impassioned speech 
continues... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Yo, [12:FF01]. What's up? 
<end> 
<start>...Did you hear the rumor about 
Yoyogi Park? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]Well... it's just a rumor. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I heard, on the night of the riot, 
a [2:FF02]demon[2:FF01] was spotted at Yoyogi Park. 
<end> 
<start>It was a terrible demon that killed 
all those people! 
<end> 
<start>Well... it's just a rumor. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You can hear some ladies talking. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Did you hear??? 
About Shinjuku Medical Center... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You mean the rumor that it's being 
run by some crazy group called 
the [2:FF02]Gaea cult[2:FF00]? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]That's the one!! Aren't cults 
horrifying??? You never know 
what they're gonna to do!! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The Yoyogi Park riot... 
The Gaea cult controlling 
Shinjuki Medical Center... 
<end> 
<start>But, we don't have anything 
to do with it! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Not again... I need ma' pills! 
<end> 
<start>The [2:FF02]hospital[2:FF01] up ahead hasn't been 
open for awhile. What's goin' on? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]By gum! Lately, I've been havin' me 
a recurrin' dream... 
<end> 
<start>It's a dream where da world 
becomes round... 
<end> 
<start>By gum! I means ter say... 
Da world IS round, but it got 
round-er, ya see!? 
<end> 
<start>I think it's a prophetic dream, 
but no one believes me... By gum! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The news is showing on 
the giant video display... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Wowie! 
<end> 
<start>What's up with everyone here? 
<end> 
<start>Everyone's so dang crabby, 
even after the riot! 
<end> 
<start>By the way... Do you wanna have 
a good time with me??? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Geez, kids today... 
<end> 
<start>There were even fatalities, 
yet it's like a carnival here. 
<end> 
<start>Just a while back, a [2:FF02]long-haired man[2:FF01] 
walked in. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Kids today are so thoughtless... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You overhear a conversation 
between some high school girls... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...Don'tcha think that Hikawa guy's 
cool? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]As if! He's got all those bad rumors 
about him floating around! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Oh, gawd! That's what makes him so 
cool! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I just saw this [2:FF02]foreign guy in red[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>He had a giant sword on his back, 
and looked dangerous! 
<end> 
<start>But, I swear I've seen him 
somewhere before... Hmmm... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]...Hello, and welcome. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Just as I foresaw, you have come to 
Asakusa. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]We are fated to meet again... 
Although, that is all I can say at 
this point. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Have you looked around Asakusa? 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Everyone is doing their best to 
restore the city. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]This is the first city we Manikins 
have ever considered as our own, 
after all. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]However... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Though you may 'see' our land, you 
may not 'enter' it any further. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]This is the holy land of the Manikins, 
[2:FF02]Mifunashiro[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Beyond here is our motherland, 
where we were born... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Even if we owe you our lives, 
I cannot allow you past here. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]I'm truly sorry... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Now, I must return to my 
meditations. I have to foresee our 
new future. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]I need to find out what I need to do 
to create a world where Manikins 
can live in peace. 
<end> 
<start>............ 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]...Oh, yes. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Beware of a Manikin named 
[2:FF02]Sakahagi[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]He's a traitor to our cause, having 
committed various atrocities. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]He's probably hiding out somewhere 
in Asakusa... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]He might cause you some trouble, 
but please understand that he is not 
one of us. 
<end> 
<start>............ 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Now, I must be going... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Futomimi left. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The door is closed tight. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> There is no response from 
the Manikin. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> There is no response from 
the Manikin. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The mirror at your feet is emitting 
light. 
<end> 
<start>> Will you step into the light? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> No one is here. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Everyone, listen to me. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]What I am about to say is critical 
to our future. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Every one of you has worked hard 
for our peace, ever since we 
escaped from the Mantra. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]But, another power is being born 
that can potentially bring our efforts 
to naught. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Yes, it's... Yoyogi... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]This evil power will take form at 
[2:FF02]Yoyogi Park[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Right now, it is but a mere shadow. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]However, when it takes form, it will 
have enough power to change 
the face of the world. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]............ 
<end> 
<start>...Yoyogi Park? 
<end> 
<start>............ 
<end> 
<start>A threat to Manikins...? 
<end> 
<start>............ 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]...But, we should not fear this. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]We have learned to work together. 
If we join forces, we will be able to 
fight this evil power. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Let us work harder and prepare for 
that time. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]We will not fall to the power that is 
brewing in Yoyogi Park... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]The future is there for us to change. 
We will create our own path. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]There will be an end to our journey, 
a world where we are free from 
suffering... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Yes, the world of Manikins will 
surely come... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Look...! They're searching for 
survivors... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Are we all going to die...? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> There is no response from 
the Manikin. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I-I'm scared...... 
<end> 
<start>I... I can't... I can't fight... 
Th-There's n-no way I could beat 
a d-demon... 
<end> 
<start>I don't wanna die... I don't wanna 
die!!!! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I know...! Y-You're a good demon, 
right...? 
<end> 
<start>Th-Then, save me! B-Beat those 
other demons! 
<end> 
<start>Leave it to me. 
<start>[7:FF07]Thank goodness! 
<end> 
<start>Then... I'll be hiding in here, 
so hurry... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Wha...? 
<end> 
<start>Y-You're a no good demon!! 
You're the same as them...! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]W-What's wrong...? Hurry... 
Beat them, hurry! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]W-What...? Leave me... alone... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> No one is here. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Well, if it isn't the Demi-fiend 
himself! We heard there was 
an unfamiliar demon here. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]To have made it this far greatly 
enforces what Lady [12:FF04] 
thinks of you. 
<end> 
<start>You are much different from those 
mud puppets who can only talk 
about creation. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]It vexes me how the mud puppets 
cling to their futile dream... 
<end> 
<start>A world without hierarchy, where 
everyone lives equally in peace... 
*chuckle* 
<end> 
<start>As followers of Yosuga, it is not 
to be tolerated. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Exactly. 
<end> 
<start>We must destroy their hopes before 
a monstrosity such as that even 
begins to take shape... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Don't you agree? 
<end> 
<start>Yes, I do. 
<start>[7:FF07]Just as we thought... 
<end> 
<start>After we finish off the mud puppets, 
Lady [12:FF04]'s god shall 
descend upon us. 
<end> 
<start>I hope we can meet again for that 
magnificent sight... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Are you sympathizing with the mud 
puppets...!? 
<end> 
<start>............ 
<end> 
<start>...So be it. 
<end> 
<start>After we finish off the mud puppets, 
Lady [12:FF04]'s god shall 
descend upon us. 
<end> 
<start>Once you see that magnificent sight, 
your opinion shall change... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Farewell! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The demons left. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Musubi: [3:FF01] pts. 
Shijima: [3:FF02] pts. 
Yosuga: [3:FF03] pts. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Will you leave the area? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> There is a Mystical Chest. 
Will you open it? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> You did not open 
the Mystical Chest. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 
[2:FF05][3:FF01][2:FF01] x [3:FF02]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You see a Cache Cube. 
Will you open it? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> You did not open 
the Cache Cube. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It's empty. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 
[2:FF05][3:FF01][2:FF01] x [3:FF02]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 
the Magatama [2:FF05][3:FF01][2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 
[2:FF05][3:FF01] Macca[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It's a trap. 
<end> 
<start>> Your party took damage. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It's empty. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> [3:FF03] found something. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]............ 
> You obtained 
[2:FF05][3:FF01][2:FF01] x [3:FF02]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It can't be used here. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The light effect wore off. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The repel effect wore off. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The attract effect wore off. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The levitation effect wore off. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Select a floor. 
<end> 
<start>[3:FF01][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF02][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF03][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF04][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF05][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF06][80EA] 
<start>[7:FF07]Futomimi is in the back, meditating 
to see the future. 
<end> 
<start>Please be quiet!! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Futomimi's prophecies have never 
been wrong.  
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I heard that Futomimi is coming out, 
so I rushed here to see. 
<end> 
<start>I don't see him! Did I miss it? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I was so wrapped up in Futomimi's 
words, I completely forgot... 
<end> 
<start>I need to restore the city! I need to 
rush back! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Futomimi's prophecies are also 
advice for those who hear them. 
<end> 
<start>They tell us what we should do. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Futomimi mentioned Yoyogi Park. 
<end> 
<start>There must be something important 
there. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]A girl... 
<end> 
<start>A demon-like girl came to steal our 
Magatsuhi... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...The girl said... mud dolls... 
...cannot conceive a Reason... 
<end> 
<start>Is... that true...? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> There is no response from 
the Manikin. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]We finally... were freed... and built... 
our own city... 
<end> 
<start>............ 
<end> 
<start>Because we tried... to... take part... 
in creation... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Ugh... It hurts. 
<end> 
<start>No... No matter how hard we work... 
we are no match... for demons, or 
for humans... 
<end> 
<start>We should have... run... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]............ 
<end> 
<start>...Up... ahead... 
<end> 
<start>A girl... and... Futomimi... 
<end> 
<start>............ 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> There is no response from 
the Manikin. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The Manikin is holding on to 
something. 
<end> 
<start>> Will you take it? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained [2:FF05]Medicine[2:FF01] x 1. 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]The girl is below... 
...in our holy land... 
<end> 
<start>Futomimi... chased after her... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Soon, Lady [12:FF04]'s god 
will descend upon us, and we will 
conceive our Reason. 
<end> 
<start>All that's left is to finish off that 
arrogant mud puppet, Futomimi... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Our goals are the same... 
just as I suspected. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]...You know, I have to admit. 
You've got guts. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]I'm impressed that you made it 
this far. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]But, it's gonna get a lot more 
dangerous from here. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]You think you're playing with fire? 
...You're gonna get more than just 
burned. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]That's why I want to offer 
my services to you. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]A demon hiring a demon slayer... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]It's the joke of the century, 
don't ya think? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]So, how 'bout it? 
<end> 
<start>Okay, I'll hire you. 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Alright then, let's talk business. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]I usually charge an outrageous 
amount of money. But in this case, 
I'll make an exception. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Let's flip a coin. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Heads or tails... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]If you win, just give me a dollar... 
Oh yeah, it's Macca here, isn't it? 
Give me 1 Macca then. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]But if you lose... 
you'll have to give me half of 
what you've got. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Call it. Heads or tails? 
<end> 
<start>Heads. 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]...Heads it is. 
You're lucky, kid. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Okay, you get the special 
discount price of 1 Macca. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> [13:FF01] paid 1 Macca 
to Dante. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]...It's heads. You lose. 
I didn't think you'd fall for 
a simple trick like this, but... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]...a deal is a deal. Pay up! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> [13:FF01] gave half 
of his money to Dante. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Thank you very much. 
Starting today, I work for you. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]...So, what's your name? 
<end> 
<start>Tell him. 
<start>[7:FF07]> [13:FF01] introduced 
himself to Dante. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]I see. Not a bad name. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Okay, [13:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Shall we go pay a visit to 
the ruler of hell? 
His servants' heads will make 
nice souvenirs. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]...Not very social, are you? 
<end> 
<start>[18:]It doesn't matter, the old guy 
already told me your name. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Okay, [13:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Shall we go pay a visit to 
the ruler of hell? 
His servants' heads will make 
nice souvenirs. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]The final battle between 
demons and the army of god... 
This'll be interesting. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]...Lighten up. 
It was just a joke. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Well anyways, I'll be here 
for a while. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Come back if you change your mind. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]You've got a lot of company 
with you. Why don't you come back 
after you've cleaned house? 
<end> 
<start>[18:]There's no need to rush; 
I'll be here for a while. 
...See ya later, kid. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]...I knew you'd come back. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]So, are you ready to hire 
the number one demon slayer? 
<end> 
<start>If you are, just let me know. 
I'm good to go. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]So, you finally came to 
your senses, huh? 
Alright then, let's talk business. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]I usually charge an outrageous 
amount of money, but in this case, 
I'll make an exception. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Let's flip a coin. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...Quit complaining, 
this is the last job 
I have for you. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You can rest as long as you want 
after you're done. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...I hate this. 
Magatsuhi makes my body itch 
all over. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Let's just get this over with. 
I need my beauty sleep. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Well, what can I say? 
We all serve a purpose... 
You guys are the stepping stones. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]It's a tough job, 
but someone's gotta do it, right? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Thanks for all the trouble you've 
gone through, [12:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]The Magatsuhi those foreign gods 
were hoarding is now mine. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]It's enough to bring my Reason, 
Musubi, into being. 
<end> 
<start>What are you doing? 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]I'm preparing for 
the ritual of Reason. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]See that? 
The Magatsuhi he's gathering 
will give power to my Reason. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]To be honest with you, 
[12:FF01], 
I'm not the one who came up with 
this brilliant idea. He did. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Of course, he planned to use 
the Magatsuhi himself... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]and it would have been you or me 
hanging up there!! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Why do you always have to be 
such a goody two-shoes? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]You think you know everything. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Listen, I'm not the one 
who came up with this idea. 
...He did. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Of course, he planned to use 
the Magatsuhi himself... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]and it would have been you or me 
hanging up there!! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...Yeah, I came up with the plan, 
but that doesn't mean I would've 
carried it out. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...Oh, I'm sure you would have. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]"In a world like this, 
one life doesn't amount to much..." 
<end> 
<start>[18:]...You said that, remember? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]It doesn't matter what I say now, 
does it? It'll just sound like 
an excuse to you. So, go ahead and 
do whatever it is you're gonna do. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Most things that are worthwhile 
require some sort of sacrifice. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]I've made many sacrifices 
in my lifetime. 
But, I've always followed 
the path that I believe in. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Just remember, 
you'll pay a high price 
for following that path. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Don't worry. 
Like you said, it's my decision. 
I'm the one in charge here. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]...Hey, [12:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]You've been such a good friend. 
To show my gratitude... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]I'd like you to perform the ritual 
to summon the god of Musubi. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]We have plenty of Magatsuhi. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]The only thing left to do 
is cast him into the depths 
of Amala... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Will you do it, 
for the sake of Musubi? 
<end> 
<start>It'd be my pleasure. 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Thanks for keeping me entertained, 
[12:FF01]. 
Good luck to ya... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Too bad. 
You must have mistaken him 
for a friend. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]The world doesn't need guys 
like him. 
They only take up space. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Oh well... 
I guess I'll have to finish this 
myself. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Okay, it's time to say goodbye. 
Soon, you'll have all the rest 
you could ever want. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Ha ha ha... 
Try your best, kid... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Pay attention, [12:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]This is what happens when you 
cross the true master of Amala. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...How should I act 
at a time like this?  
<end> 
<start>[18:]...Should I be happy? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Like, "I'm glad we're both okay."? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]It's you, [12:FF01], right? 
...I can tell. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Don't worry... 
Nothing phases me anymore. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]I realized... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]No matter how much I cry or shout, 
this nightmare won't end. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]I'm... a little tired. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][12:FF01]... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Do you know what happened 
to the world? 
<end> 
<start>The Conception occurred. 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]The Conception? 
<end> 
<start>[18:]You mean... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]What was written in that magazine 
actually happened? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]...I see. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]...I feel sick to my stomach. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]...I see. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]I fell unconscious at the hospital, 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]...and when I woke up, 
there were demons everywhere. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]No one was around, 
and my cell phone didn't work. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]So, I ran outside for help, but... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]...it wasn't just the hospital 
that had changed. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You saw how it was out there, right? 
<end> 
<start>[18:]I couldn't even tell where my house 
used to be... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]I seriously thought that I was 
the only person still alive. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]...I'm so glad to see you, 
[12:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Maybe... there's still hope. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]There's got to be other survivors, 
don't you think? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Ms. [11:FF02] 
and [12:FF03] 
might be around somewhere, too. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]I'll go look for them. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]...I'm not ready to give up entirely. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]They must be alive. 
Fate can't be that cruel. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Otherwise... 
I don't know what I'll do. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...Well, what do we have here? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Who dares to disrupt this stillness? 
<end> 
<start>How irritating... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...A well-known poet once said, 
<end> 
<start>[18:]"April is the cruelest month." 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Why? Because it is then that one 
must wake up from a long sleep 
and face the barren world. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Looking back on the past, 
it is evident that the history 
of mankind is comprised of 
meaningless events. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]The worthless overgrowth of 
a civilization blind to its sins, 
<end> 
<start>[18:]continuous bloodshed and war, 
<end> 
<start>[18:]and thousands of years of repeating 
the same mistakes again and again. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]...The world must start over 
from the beginning. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The way to salvation was foretold 
in the Scripture of Miroku, 
and today is the day that 
the prophecy shall be fulfilled. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]The old world will sink 
like a setting sun, 
and the new world will arise 
in its place. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...Who are you? 
<end> 
<start>From what I remember, 
you're not one of our followers 
who survived the purge at the park. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...An acquaintance of 
Ms. [11:FF02]? 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Come to think of it, 
this was a hospital, wasn't it? 
I see, you came to visit her. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]...Such a troublesome Maiden. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Well... 
I'll leave the teaching to the teacher. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Please leave this room. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]I would like to enjoy this blissful end 
in solitude. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...[12:FF01], I'll be waiting 
on the roof. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]We'll have a good view 
of the city from there. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Come, see it with your own eyes. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Witness that which will change 
the world... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]However, even a pebble creates 
ripples when cast in water. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]I do feel pity for you, but... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]...your life ends here! 
<start>[7:FF07]...Do not fear. 
<end> 
<start>All the inhabitants of this world 
will follow before long. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Your time has come just 
a bit sooner, that's all. 
<end> 
<start>Face him. 
<start>[7:FF07]Fool... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]No one can overcome their fate. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]What a futile attempt... 
<end> 
<start>One should face death honorably. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Stop! 
<start>[7:FF07]What, can't you let one person go? 
<end> 
<start>[18:][7:FF07]It should have absolutely no effect 
on our plan. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The insignificance of the gesture 
makes no difference. 
I will not allow any exceptions. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]If you don't save him... 
I'll stop cooperating with you. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You should've just handed over 
your Magatsuhi... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]But instead, 
you decided to oppose me... 
That was too funny. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Well, I'm not complaining. 
Now, I have this new skin to add 
to my collection... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...!! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Who's there!? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Damn, you had me scared for  
a second... I thought 
those Manikins were back. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]They're pretty weak, 
all of them except this one guy 
that escaped from the Mantra... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]He's been giving me a headache 
recently. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]It would've made my life 
a lot easier if he'd been 
killed in Ikebukuro. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I should thank him, though, 
for bringing his followers here. 
It's like free Magatsuhi. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I've been collecting Magatsuhi... 
Eventually, I'll have enough power 
to dominate all demons. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You're a demon; 
you know how it is. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You're thirsty for some Magatsuhi 
yourself, aren't ya? 
<end> 
<start>Yeah, I am. 
<start>[7:FF07]That's what I thought. 
<end> 
<start>Hey, I think you and I 
will get along just fine. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You don't want Magatsuhi? 
...You're one weird demon. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...Well, it's time for me to go. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Maybe we'll meet again, 
maybe not. We'll see. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Just remember... I'm Sakahagi, 
the future ruler of the demons... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF06]...You who are about to ascend 
my tower, and who wishes to enter 
the light... 
<end> 
<start>Show me your heart... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF06]...I see a Reason as tranquil as 
a still lake... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF06]...I see a Reason as fierce as 
a raging flame... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF06]...I see a Reason as hard as 
a flawless gem... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF06]To breathe your Reason into the act 
of creation... 
<end> 
<start>If such is your goal, 
then come before me with 
the [2:FF02]three stones of treasure[2:FF01]! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF06]...You who are about to ascend 
my tower, and who wishes to enter 
the light... 
<end> 
<start>Show me your heart... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF06]...I cannot see within your heart... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF06]Who are you...? 
Is your purpose in accordance 
with my will? 
<end> 
<start>If you dare, then come before me 
with the [2:FF02]three stones of treasure[2:FF01]... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF06]...You who are about to ascend 
my tower, and who wishes to enter 
the light... 
<end> 
<start>Show me your heart... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF06]...All I see is darkness 
inside you... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF06]No light remains in your heart, 
and your purpose is in defiance 
of my will... 
<end> 
<start>If you dare, then come before me 
with the [2:FF02]three stones of treasure[2:FF01]... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF06][829D][83CD][83E2][818C][8BAC][8196][81A6][80E4][80F1][80FB][8289] 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]That swordsman with immeasurable 
strength and two pistols... 
I see you survived the battle 
against him. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]The demon inside you will continue 
to be your source of strength 
during your quest. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Power... 
It is sought by all. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Whether it is the power of light, 
or the power of darkness, 
people rely on it, and pray... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]They pray, wishing for greater 
power... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]A woman you know well prayed to 
a god in hopes of saving the world... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Let me tell you about that god... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Aradia, god of falsehood... 
<end> 
<start>She is from a Vortex World beyond 
the boundaries of this world. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]In the Amala Universe, 
where time and space melt together 
and flow as one, 
<end> 
<start>there exist countless Vortex Worlds. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]One of these worlds is where Aradia 
originated. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]As you are already aware, 
<end> 
<start>this Vortex World was made by 
the true power of creation. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]But, in shadow lies a world where 
those branded as false gather, 
<end> 
<start>and that is the Vortex World where 
Aradia once resided. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Those who dwell there wish for 
one thing: 
<end> 
<start>for their existence to become real... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]To find the means, 
they depart into the ocean of Amala 
and seek out worlds that hold 
the power of creation. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Aradia is a tragic savior 
born of dreams. 
<end> 
<start>She emerged in response to 
the cries of witches who were 
persecuted for their beliefs. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The witches prayed to Aradia for 
power and freedom... 
<end> 
<start>They also prayed for people to be 
saved from the hardships of life. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]However, Aradia never showed 
herself on earth, nor did she 
save anyone. 
<end> 
<start>She was a god who could only give 
hope to her believers. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Humans, whom god created, 
created a new god... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Anything is possible in the vast 
ocean of Amala. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Nevertheless, Aradia is still 
an outsider. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]There is little that she can do in 
a Vortex World where her existence 
is forbidden. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]She is merely the god of forsaken 
freedom... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]There are many you have spoken 
to: the Fiends... us... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]You have heard the voice of 
the Absolute One, too. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]But, please know this... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]In the everlasting flow of Amala, 
we have long waited for you... 
for this time to come. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]The true significance of 
the candelabra and the Labyrinth 
of Amala, 
<end> 
<start>[18:]the new demon of chaos, 
whom all are waiting for 
in anticipation, 
<end> 
<start>[18:]and the final moment that 
my master awaits... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]...You must be overwhelmed by it all. 
<end> 
<start>[18:][12:FF01]... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]If you can restore the candelabra 
to their original places and come 
here once again, 
<end> 
<start>[18:]then at that time... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]I will tell you the answers to all 
of your questions. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...... 
<end> 
<start>We exist... to watch o'er 
the candelabra... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]As long as thou seekest 
the candelabra... 
thou art mine enemy... 
<end> 
<start>I... the Black Rider... 
shall judge thee... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Thy death draweth nigh, 
o sinful one... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 
the [2:FF02]Candelabrum of Wisdom[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Oh, you're back. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Um, [12:FF01]... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]You know that special report at 
the beginning of the magazine? 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Well, it says some things that are 
a little disturbing. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]According to the report, there's 
a group of demon worshippers 
who call themselves the Gaea cult... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]They're right here in Japan. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Anyway, they believe in 
this book of prophecy called 
the Scripture of Miroku. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]In that book, it says that 
chaos will befall the world, 
<end> 
<start>[18:]and these people are actually 
trying to make that happen. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]The reporter was unable to learn 
what is meant by "chaos"... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]It could be worldwide terrorism, 
or some other tragedy. But... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...Oh yeah, there's something else 
you should know. 
<end> 
<start>When I told [12:FF03] about it, 
he went off on his own to look for 
Ms. [11:FF02] some more. 
<end> 
<start>He asked me to give you this. 
I guess he found it somewhere 
and just took it. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained an [2:FF02]ID Card[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I'll stay here. 
<end> 
<start>...I hope you guys find her soon.

<start>[7:FF07][18:]I've heard weird stories 
about this place. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Things like they experiment 
on patients, and how a psychic 
got scared and ran outta here... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]There was also one about 
the hospital being under 
the influence of some cult... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...Really? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]I haven't heard those things before. 
Maybe we shouldn't have come... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]I don't normally take this kind 
of magazine too seriously, but... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]There's definitely something wrong 
with this hospital. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]...... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]I'm worried about 
Ms. [11:FF02]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Hey, let's look around some more. 
If we don't find anything, 
then at least we'll know that 
there's nothing bad here. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]It looks like you can access 
the annex from the second floor. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]I'll go take a look. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained an [2:FF02]ID Card[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Here you go, [12:FF01]. 
You can use this to search 
the basement. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Why don't you search the basement 
yourself? 
<end> 
<start>[18:]...You're not scared, are you? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]O-Of course not! 
<end> 
<start>[18:]I'm sure she's not down there, 
that's why I'm having 
[12:FF01] go! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]All [12:FF01] needs to do 
is confirm that Ms. [11:FF02] 
isn't in the basement. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]It's my duty to see her in person. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]If something does happen, 
[12:FF01], just run like hell! 
Alright? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]*sigh* 
I can't believe him sometimes. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]But now, I'm worried about 
Ms. [11:FF02]. 
We should make sure she's okay. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][6:FF01]This is the Cathedral of Shadows... 
What is your bidding? 
<start>[7:FF07][6:FF01]This is the Cathedral of Shadows... 
The heavens shine brightly. 
What is your bidding? 
<start>[7:FF07][6:FF01]This is the Cathedral of Shadows... 
What is your bidding, cursed one? 
<start>[7:FF07][6:FF01]You do not have enough demons... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][6:FF01]Kagutsuchi is at its brightest... 
Will you offer a sacrifice? 
<start>[7:FF07][6:FF01]Are you sure? 
<start>[7:FF07][6:FF01]You aren't strong enough 
to control it... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][6:FF01]You already have one 
in your party... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][6:FF01]Hmmm...? 
It seems an unexpected demon 
was born. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][6:FF01]Hmmm...? 
It seems it is more powerful 
than expected. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][6:FF01]What will you do? 
<start>[7:FF07][6:FF01]What will you do 
with the Compendium? 
<start>[7:FF07][6:FF01]You do not have anyone who 
needs to be registered. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][6:FF01]No one is registered yet. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][6:FF01]Who will you register? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][6:FF01]There is already a record of this 
demon. Will you overwrite it? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][6:FF01][3:FF02] has been registered. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][6:FF01]It will cost [3:FF03] Macca. 
Are you okay with that? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][6:FF01]It will cost [3:FF03] Macca... 
But, it seems you don't 
have enough. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][6:FF01]What do you want to know? 
<start>[7:FF07][6:FF01]Come back again. 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07][6:FF01]These are the demons that 
differ from the records. 
Who will you register? 
<start>[7:FF07][6:FF01]There is already a record of this 
demon. Will you overwrite it? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][6:FF01]The record has been updated. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][6:FF01]Hmmm... 
That is everyone. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][6:FF01]It will cost [2:FF05][3:FF01] Macca[2:FF01]. 
Are you okay with that? 
<start>[7:FF07][6:FF01]I have succeeded in summoning 
[3:FF02]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][6:FF01]It will cost [2:FF05][3:FF01] Macca[2:FF01]... 
But, it seems you don't  
have enough. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][6:FF01]You already have one 
in your party... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][6:FF01]Your party is full. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][6:FF01]You are not strong enough 
to control it... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][6:FF01]Even I cannot handle 
this man... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][6:FF01]Is it okay to register everyone? 
<start>[7:FF07][6:FF01]I registered everyone.

...Let us hurry, Demi-fiend. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][6:FF01]Fusion is the ritual of fusing two 
demons together to form a new one. 
<end> 
<start>You can usually create a demon 
with a higher level than the 
two you originally fused. 
<end> 
<start>You are essentially trading in  
two demons for one, so you will  
be losing a member. 
<end> 
<start>It is always important that you 
keep in mind the ability of 
your members before fusing them. 
<end> 
<start>Some demons don't fuse with  
others, like those from 
dark and light alliances. 
<end> 
<start>If you want to survive, 
be sure not to forget 
these basics. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][6:FF01]I assume that you are already 
aware that demons are  
categorized into 'races'... 
<end> 
<start>You should also be aware that the  
races 'Element' and 'Mitama'  
are special. 
<end> 
<start>If you fuse them together, 
the outcome will differ from 
that of a normal fusion. 
<end> 
<start>If you fuse a normal demon with an 
Element, it will become another 
demon of the same race. 
<end> 
<start>If you fuse it with a Mitama, 
it will not be reborn, but it 
will become more powerful. 
<end> 
<start>It would be wise to remember 
that. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][6:FF01]Kagutsuchi is the source of all 
light present in the middle of 
the world... 
<end> 
<start>Its light has special powers, 
and makes demons go mad. 
<end> 
<start>When it is shining its 
brightest, you can use the 
light for fusion. 
<end> 
<start>By offering another demon as 
a sacrifice, you can use 
'sacrificial fusion'. 
<end> 
<start>Sacrificial fusion will allow 
you to create demons with 
higher stats and more skills. 
<end> 
<start>There are demons that can only 
be born from sacrificial fusion. 
<end> 
<start>If you use it right, it will 
be of great benefit to you. 
<end> 
<start>Just remember that you can't 
offer a sacrifice if you're 
fusing with a Mitama. 
<end> 
<start>Also, accidents often occur 
when Kagutsuchi is at its  
brightest. 
<end> 
<start>The choice is up to you... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][6:FF01]As minister, I am always 
doing my best when fusing. 
<end> 
<start>...But, nothing is always 
definite. 
<end> 
<start>Sometimes there are accidents  
during the ritual. 
<end> 
<start>When that happens, even I 
don't know what will be born. 
<end> 
<start>Just remember that there 
is always a chance that 
something may go wrong... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][6:FF01]The demons born from fusion 
may remember the skills of 
the previous demons. 
<end> 
<start>So, if you use it right, you 
can have a demon with innate  
skills. 
<end> 
<start>We do not know everything 
about it yet, but let me 
tell you three things... 
<end> 
<start>First, the skills carried over 
changes every time you select  
the demons to be fused. 
<end> 
<start>Second, the new demon has  
affinities with certain skills, 
making some easier to remember. 
<end> 
<start>Third, the level of the 
demons to be fused affects how 
many skills are carried over. 
<end> 
<start>So, you see, leveling up the  
demons you already have is  
never a waste. 
<end> 
<start>Remember that. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][6:FF01]The book that holds all of the 
information about demons is known  
as the 'Demonic Compendium'. 
<end> 
<start>If a demon joins your party, 
it will automatically be 
recorded in the Compendium. 
<end> 
<start>Those recorded can be summoned 
to any Cathedral of Shadows. 
<end> 
<start>Also, if you level up a demon 
and register it, you will be 
able to summon it at that level. 
<end> 
<start>...But, remember that it'll 
cost you money to summon 
a demon. 
<end> 
<start>The stronger the demon, the 
more it'll cost you.  
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][6:FF01]With the power they have sealed 
inside, Magatama can change 
humans into demons. 
<end> 
<start>Each Magatama's powers are  
unique, giving their host  
new skills. 
<end> 
<start>There are Magatama that can give 
techniques that no other demon 
has ever seen or used. 
<end> 
<start>When will it give out new 
techniques? Ask the Magatama 
itself. 
<end> 
<start>You can tell when the time is 
near by its movement. 
<end> 
<start>We help those who use Magatama 
in order to fulfill our duty. 
<end> 
<start>When you have collected all the  
Magatama... That will be the 
time to carry out our mission. 
<end> 
<start>Come back to the Cathedral 
of Shadows once you have 
collected all the Magatama. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]...Hey, [12:FF01]. 
I'm glad that the commotion 
at Yoyogi Park has settled down. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]It's pretty scary, when you think 
about it... the struggle for power. 
Who knows, the end of this world 
might come sooner than we think... 
<end> 
<start>...... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]I can only assume that 
[12:FF03] was absorbed 
by the Amala Network, 
<end> 
<start>[18:]because I can't find any trace 
of him. Oh well, I guess 
working alone gets you nowhere. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]By the way, do you happen to know 
what's going on in Ikebukuro? 
<end> 
<start>[18:]I heard that Gozu-Tennoh is back, 
and gaining power. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]It's probably just a rumor, 
though, since his body 
was shattered into pieces. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]It doesn't make any difference. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]As soon as I seize control 
of Amala, it'll all be over... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]I'll continue my research on Amala. 
I'm almost there... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Why don't you check out Ikebukuro? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Oh... I wasn't expecting you, 
[12:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]My master is resting right now. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]If you're here for information, 
I'd be glad to help you. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]...Is there anything else you want 
to ask about, [12:FF01]? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]...Alright. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]I'll try to help you as much as I can. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]So, what is it that you'd like 
to know about? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]...Then, you should get going. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]I look forward to seeing you again... 
<end> 
<start>I want to ask you about something. 
<start>The Vortex World 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Okay... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Listen closely. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]...Then, you should get going. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]I look forward to seeing you again... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]I see that your quest for 
the candelabra is going well. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Those that stole the candelabra 
are unique and powerful demons... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]They are [2:FF02]Fiends[2:FF01], 
manifestations of death. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]...Now that I think about it, 
<end> 
<start>[18:]this all started because of one man 
who caused the Conception in 
the previous world. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]The Conception... Because of it, 
the Vortex World was born. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Kagutsuchi is the source of light 
and power for this world. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]You who once lived as a human 
must be wandering this world 
without any understanding. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]To show my appreciation, 
I would like to share with you 
my knowledge of the Vortex World 
and Kagutsuchi. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Kagutsuchi... It is the light 
whose sole purpose is to empower 
the one who will oversee creation. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Creation is the act of bringing 
a new world into existence, 
made possible by the annihilation 
of the old world. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Kagutsuchi will allow a life form 
of its choosing to determine 
the course of the new world. 
<end> 
<start>There must be those in Tokyo who 
yearn to be chosen by Kagutsuchi, 
in order to realize their vision. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The shape of the world to come 
depends on who is chosen, 
and what their Reason is. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]In the vast Amala Universe, 
this Vortex World is not the only 
place where creation occurs. 
<end> 
<start>Kagutsuchi rises, matures, 
and falls in countless other places. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]There are millions--no, billions 
of worlds that you are unaware of, 
and they all experience the cycle 
of death and rebirth. 
<end> 
<start>That is the way of Amala, 
as determined by the Great Will. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]With my master, I have watched how 
myriads of worlds came into being, 
how life prospered in those worlds, 
and how they fell to ruin... 
<end> 
<start>...all that time, seeking the answer 
to the unanswerable question, 
"Why is a world reborn?" 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]But now... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]We may be on the verge of finding 
the answer... 
<end> 
<start>...and it is your actions which hold 
the key. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Please retrieve the remaining 
candelabra as soon as possible, 
and then come see my master. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]My master has high hopes for you. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]The fallen angel has bestowed upon 
you great strength. Do not lose your 
life and let this gift be in vain. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]...Hello, [12:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]My master is resting right now. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]...I want you to know that I'm 
always thinking about you. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]The Fiends possess strength 
beyond compare... 
But, I have confidence in you. 
<end> 
<start>[18:][12:FF01], 
<end> 
<start>[18:]I know that you'll return all 
the candelabra to the Labyrinth 
of Amala. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...Hey, are you listening? 
<start>[7:FF07]Let's get going. 
[12:FF04] will get mad 
if we make her wait too long. 
<start>[7:FF07]> You received a new e-mail. 
<start>[7:FF07]Hi, how are you? 
<start>[7:FF07]I'm doing much better. 
I think I'm ready to leave 
the hospital pretty soon. 
<start>[7:FF07]My doubts and fears 
have caused you all 
a lot of trouble. 
<start>[7:FF07]But, you've overcome 
these obstacles... 
and saved me. 
<start>[7:FF07]Back then, the world looked 
so sad to me. 
<start>[7:FF07]That's probably because 
I was sad myself. 
<start>[7:FF07]But, I've changed my thinking, 
and I'm going to continue on 
with my life. 
<start>[7:FF07]No matter what the world is like, 
I won't give up. 
I'm going to believe in myself... 
<start>[7:FF07]...What am I saying? 
You already know all this. 
<start>[7:FF07]If it wasn't for you, 
we wouldn't even be here right now. 
<start>[7:FF07]...Thank you. 
<start>[7:FF07]> No one is here. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> There is no response. 
<end> 
<start>> You need something to activate it. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> There is a mysterious wall. 
<end> 
<start>> Will you use the Umugi Stone? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> You used the Umugi Stone. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The building has been shrouded in 
a mirage. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You left it as is. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It is no longer working. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The mysterious wall is spewing 
smoke. 
<end> 
<start>> Will you use the Umugi Stone? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> You used the Umugi Stone. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The mirage is disappearing. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You left it as is. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Heheheh... 
<end> 
<start>Gozu-Tennoh is gone. This prison 
now belongs to [2:FF02]Mizuchi[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>...I feel like torturing those [2:FF02]Manikins 
in the mirage[2:FF01]! I think I'll go do that 
right now. Heheheh... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Who the hell are you!? 
<end> 
<start>Wait, you couldn't be...!? 
<end> 
<start>You better believe it. 
<start>[7:FF07]...I-I don't care! 
<end> 
<start>This is paradise for us ex-Mantra! 
<end> 
<start>Whatever you did during that attack 
on Nihilo doesn't mean shit here!! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Whaddya think you're doing here 
then, punk!? 
<end> 
<start>This is paradise for us ex-Mantra! 
<end> 
<start>I'll give you a taste of my torturing 
techniques!! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained the [2:FF02]Umugi Stone[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The demon disappeared. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]C'mon, c'mon, c'mon! You better 
keep it up, or you'll be dead! 
<end> 
<start>You want me to stop? You REALLY 
want me to stop? 
<end> 
<start>...Well, too bad!! 
<end> 
<start>Hyahahahahahahahahaha!! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Gaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!! 
Ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow!! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Hyahahahahahahahahaha!! 
<end> 
<start>Phew!! I think I'll let you off with 
that for today. 
<end> 
<start>I have [2:FF02]this[2:FF01], so I can come and go 
into the mirage as I please. 
<end> 
<start>...I'll be back! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You can hear a voice coming from 
somewhere. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Save us... We're trapped in 
the mirage... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Mizuchi is holding us captive in 
his mirage... 
<end> 
<start>Someone save us! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Save me! Free me! 
<end> 
<start>I don't wanna be sucked dry of 
Magatsuhi! I don't wanna die!! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]This is Kabukicho Prison. 
<end> 
<start>The ex-Mantra demons have now 
turned this... 
<end> 
<start>............? 
<end> 
<start>I thought someone was talking to 
me... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I can't take it anymore... 
<end> 
<start>Are we Manikins made just to feel 
pain!? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Where is the Collector Manikin, 
you ask? 
<end> 
<start>Hmmm...... 
<end> 
<start>Well, he's not on this floor. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Arrrrrrrrrgh! I'm being sucked dry!! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The Collector Manikin was caught 
recently... 
<end> 
<start>I think he's here somewhere... 
<end> 
<start>He's on floor... 
<end> 
<start>Ummm...... 
<end> 
<start>1F...... 2F...... 
<end> 
<start>3F...... 4F...... 
<end> 
<start>............ 
<end> 
<start>Because I'm poor, I can't 
remember. But... 
<end> 
<start>Maybe 100 Macca will refresh 
my memory!! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]3F...... 4F...... 
<end> 
<start>5F... 4F... 3F... 
<end> 
<start>It's at the tip of my tongue! 
If only I had another 100 Macca... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][7:FF07]> Will you give the Manikin 
100 Macca? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]5F...... 
<end> 
<start>4F...... 
<end> 
<start>3F...... 
<end> 
<start>3F...... 
<end> 
<start>4F...... 
<end> 
<start>3F...... 
<end> 
<start>...Oh yeah, he's on [2:FF02]2F[2:FF01]... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You don't have enough... 
<end> 
<start>It sucks being poor... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You're a friggin' tightwad... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...... 
<end> 
<start>...... 
<end> 
<start>......... 
<end> 
<start>...Leave me alone. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The Collector Manikin? 
<end> 
<start>He's a great guy! Talks to himself 
like a weirdo... But, general 
insanity aside, I like him. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The Collector Manikin? 
<end> 
<start>Oh... The one who talks to himself! 
<end> 
<start>What about him? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You can hear someone muttering. 
<end> 
<start>...Bill...... 
<end> 
<start>......1000... 
<end> 
<start>............ 
<end> 
<start>> You couldn't hear the rest. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07].........1000... 
<end> 
<start>......Watermark... 
<end> 
<start>............ 
<end> 
<start>............ 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It seems the Manikin is absorbed 
with talking to himself. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]*cough* 
<end> 
<start>............? 
<end> 
<start>...I know you! 
<end> 
<start>You're the demon I met in the Great 
Underpass... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...Huh? A spoon? 
<end> 
<start>............ 
<end> 
<start>...I see.  
<end> 
<start>...Alright, then. 
<end> 
<start>You did help me... with the Bill... 
<end> 
<start>*cough* I'll give you my spoon... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained the [2:FF02]spoon[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...While you're at it, could you 
rescue me...? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The Mantra's headquarters was 
empty, so I came here, hee ho. 
<end> 
<start>But, hee hee ho ho! This place is 
scary! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Huh? You're the demon I just talked 
to, hee ho. 
<end> 
<start>I wanna walk on the ceiling, too! 
<end> 
<start>Will I be able to do it once I become 
like the King, hee ho? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Hee ho? You again? 
<end> 
<start>...I'm not worth much experience, 
hee ho! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Does this shutter only open from 
the other side, hee ho? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]What ho? Collector Manikin? 
<end> 
<start>I thought I saw him, but I forgot 
where, hee ho! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Will I ever be like the King, 
hee ho...? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Our leader, Futomimi, is being held 
in a special room on the top floor. 
<end> 
<start>He's special. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Now that I think of it... 
<end> 
<start>The Collector Manikin is near 
a hole. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Try jumping into a hole! You may 
end up somewhere you haven't 
been. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> This is the hole that the Manikin 
jumped into. 
<end> 
<start>> Will you jump into it? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> There is a hole. 
<end> 
<start>> Will you jump into it? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]............ 
<end> 
<start>> A Manikin is doing something. 
<end> 
<start>> Will you talk to him? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]......Shit! A Mantra demon!? 
<end> 
<start>............? 
<end> 
<start>Noooooooooooo! My spoon broke! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Look what you did! I was almost 
done digging, too... 
<end> 
<start>It's you're fault! I needed that 
spoon... Take responsibility! 
<end> 
<start>...I know. How about you getting me 
another spoon? 
<end> 
<start>The [2:FF02]Collector Manikin[2:FF01] should be 
around here somewhere. He has just 
about anything. 
<end> 
<start>Find him and grab a [2:FF02]spoon[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>You got that? You're responsible! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The [2:FF02]Collector Manikin[2:FF01] should be 
around here somewhere. 
<end> 
<start>Get a [2:FF02]spoon[2:FF01] from him and bring it 
back to me, alright? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Did you bring me the spoon? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Will you hand him the spoon? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]What the heck!? I was counting on 
you!! 
<end> 
<start>Hurry up and get that spoon from 
the Collector Manikin! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Whoa! This is one powerful spoon! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The Manikin began digging. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The hole was dug instantly. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...This is incredible. I dug the hole in 
a flash. 
<end> 
<start>Alright, I'm outta here. 
<end> 
<start>See ya! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The Manikin jumped into the hole. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The Manikin is gone. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You can hear a voice coming from 
somewhere. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You can hear a voice coming from 
somewhere. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...Dammit!! 
<end> 
<start>I was able to escape from my cell... 
<end> 
<start>But I need to defeat Mizuchi to 
escape from the mirage... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]A short while back, a human came 
along. He was young. 
<end> 
<start>He's being kept at the top, just like 
Futomimi. 
<end> 
<start>He was caught because humans 
have lots of Magatsuhi. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Collector Manikin? 
<end> 
<start>I saw him as I was being dragged 
here. ...He must be below. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Please... Save our prophet, 
[2:FF02]Futomimi[2:FF01]... 
<end> 
<start>Above... He's on the 5th floor... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Mizuchi... is on the floor above... 
<end> 
<start>But......... in the mirage... 
<end> 
<start>............ 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Argh! Stop it! 
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Gyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!!!! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]............ 
<end> 
<start>> It's quiet now. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The Manikin is unconscious... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You there, listen to what I have to 
say! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You see those doors over there? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Mizuchi, the boss of this prison, is in 
there! 
<end> 
<start>Defeat him and save Futomimi, 
please!! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Mizuchi, the boss of this prison, is in 
that room over there! 
<end> 
<start>Please defeat him and save 
Futomimi!! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You sense strong power from 
beyond the door. 
<end> 
<start>> Will you enter? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]MWAHAHAHAHA! 
<end> 
<start>YOU CANNOT SEE ME! 
<end> 
<start>...NOR CAN YOU LAY A FINGER 
ON ME FROM THERE! 
<end> 
<start>FOOL! TAKE THIS! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You were knocked out of the room. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]DAMN YOU PESTS! 
<end> 
<start>YOU THINK YOU CAN BEAT ME? 
NOT A CHANCE! 
<end> 
<start>I'LL TEAR YOU APART! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]ARRRRRRRRRGH! 
<end> 
<start>MY BODY IS... MY MIRAGE WORLD 
IS... DISAPPEARING!! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The mirage is disappearing. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained the Magatama 
[2:FF03]Miasma[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]............! 
<end> 
<start>[18:]......You're...... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]...a human...? No, a demon...? 
<end> 
<start>[18:]...I see. You are the "Demi-fiend" 
I prophesied about. Very interesting. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Thank you for defeating Mizuchi. 
Now, we can finally escape from this 
mirage. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]My name is [2:FF02]Futomimi[2:FF01]. You may know 
it already, but I can see into the near 
future. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]I've been waiting for you to come 
and save us, you who are both 
human and demon... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]You may be interested to know that 
there is a [2:FF02]young man[2:FF01] trapped in 
the other room. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]It seems he came to see me, but he 
was also caught. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Hm...? 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]...I see, he is your friend. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]You should see him, then. I sense 
a strange energy in him. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]I am worried about the other 
Manikins, so I must be going. 
Thank you again for saving us. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]...Now, if you'll excuse me. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Futomimi left. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]I have come again to thank you 
once more. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]...We Manikins plan to leave 
the area. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Together, we will find a way to live 
without suffering. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]...Let me prophesy your future as 
a token of my gratitude. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]...A man... at Ginza... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]...It seems that there is a man 
waiting for you at Ginza. Go and see 
him. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]...We must get going now. Again, 
thank you so much. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]...Now, if you'll excuse us. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Futomimi led the other Manikins out. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]............ 
<end> 
<start>Let me rest awhile. ...Just a little... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> All the torture must have gotten to 
him. He doesn't want to move. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Heeeeee hoooooo!! 
<end> 
<start>I've become hee ho evil! 
I'm [2:FF02]Black Frost[2:FF01], heeeeee hoooooo! 
<end> 
<start>I'm so evil, they call me 
the "Emperor of Kabukicho"! 
<end> 
<start>The demon within you drives me 
hee ho crazy!! 
<end> 
<start>The world belongs to the mighty 
Emperor!! 
<end> 
<start>How's that? Are you impressed, 
hee ho? 
<end> 
<start>I'm so scared... 
<start>[7:FF07]Heeeeee hoooooo! I'm so cool! 
<end> 
<start>But, an Emperor needs to be cold! 
No mercy! 
<end> 
<start>You're all gonna freeze in hell! 
...Uh, "freeze in hell"...? 
<end> 
<start>Ah, who cares! Heeeeee hoooooo!! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I'm pissed! Got that, hee ho!? 
<end> 
<start>You got guts! 
<end> 
<start>But, so do I! 
<end> 
<start>I'll show you the power of 
the Emperor! Heeeeee hoooooo!! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Heeeeee hoooooo... 
<end> 
<start>Why are you interfering with my 
plans to become evil? 
<end> 
<start>All I wanted was to be like the 
legendary King! Scary, yet cute... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...That's all I ever wanted, hee ho! 
<end> 
<start>Hee ho, crap!! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Hee... I'm melting......Ho...... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Black Frost melted. 
<end> 
<start>> You obtained the Magatama 
[2:FF03]Satan[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Whoa! You a ceiling walker? 
<end> 
<start>Cool, man! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]This is Kabukicho Prison. 
<end> 
<start>The ex-Mantra demons have now 
turned this place into their own 
playground. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Huh? I thought this was a prison. 
I don't see anyone. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][2:FF02] Pretend you have entered battle. 
<end> 
<start>> Pretend you fought really, really 
hard. 
<end> 
<start>> You won. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]If you don't see [2:FF02]Futomimi[2:FF01] and [2:FF02]Isamu[2:FF01], 
there will be a bunch of Manikins 
here. 
<end> 
<start>If you meet them, they will leave for 
[2:FF02]Asakusa[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>You can now go farther in. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Th-This is debug? 
<end> 
<start>I'm Futomimi. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Blah. 
<end> 
<start>Blah. 
<end> 
<start>Blah. 
<end> 
<start>Blah. 
<end> 
<start>Blah. 
<end> 
<start>Blah. 
<end> 
<start>Blah. 
<end> 
<start>Blah. 
<end> 
<start>Blah. 
<end> 
<start>Blah. 
<end> 
<start>Blah. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Futomimi left. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]We're sorry. This stuff is too heavy 
for us. 
<end> 
<start>Can you help us? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Sorry to bother you again. There's 
more junk in our way. 
<end> 
<start>Can you help us? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]Oh, thank you!! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I see... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Thank you very much! We can 
finally get out!! 
<end> 
<start>As a token of our appreciation, 
take this. 
<end> 
<start>> You obtained [2:FF05]Life Stone[2:FF01] x 5. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Thank you very much! This time, we 
can finally get out!! 
<end> 
<start>As a token of our appreciation, 
take this. 
<end> 
<start>> You obtained [2:FF05]Medicine[2:FF01] x 4. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The Manikins left. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Check it out, there's a hole in 
the floor. 
<end> 
<start>...By the way, the shutter doesn't 
seem to open from this side. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Check it out, there's a hole in 
the ceiling. 
<end> 
<start>...By the way, the shutter won't open 
unless you press the button. 
<end> 
<start>...Hey, who am I talking to? 
<end> 
<start>No way. 
<start>[7:FF07]Come on... 
<end> 
<start>I'm begging you! Defeat Mizuchi and 
save Futomimi! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Thank you. Our friends can finally 
rest now... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Will you leave the area? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> There is a Mystical Chest. 
Will you open it? 
<end>

[2:FF05][3:FF01][2:FF01] x [3:FF02].

<start>[7:FF07]> You see a Cache Cube. 
Will you open it? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> You did not open 
the Cache Cube. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It's empty. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained

<start>[3:FF06][80EA] 
<start>[7:FF07]Where's our leader? How about 
the human boy? 
<end> 
<start>Are they okay? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I'm surprised you were able to make 
it up here, with all that junk blocking 
the halls. 
<end> 
<start>...Did you meet the young man in 
the back room? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]"That damn Mizuchi!! 
<end> 
<start>I was all ready to kick his ass!!" 
<end> 
<start>...That's what the tough-talking 
Jack Frost was saying when he left 
the building. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Ah...... 
<end> 
<start>Free at last... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]............ 
<end> 
<start>...I'm taking a break. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]............ 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> There is no response. 
<end> 
<start>> He must have taken quite 
a beating. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You sense strong power from 
beyond the door. 
<end> 
<start>> Will you enter? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]This is Kabukicho Prison. 
<end> 
<start>...Huh? This is just a run-down 
building? 
<end> 
<start>You got that wrong. This is 
a prison!! 
<end> 
<start>Even though the Mantra fell, 
there's still loads of Manikins 
being held here. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]This is Kabukicho Prison. 
<end> 
<start>...Well, it's not a prison anymore, 
with Mizuchi being defeated and all. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Brrrr... It's freezing... 
<end> 
<start>...This is all the Emperor's doing. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The Emperor is gone... 
<end> 
<start>A lot has happened here, but now 
it's finally quiet. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The Emperor on the top floor is 
doing whatever he pleases in my 
territory! 
<end> 
<start>I'd go whoop the boy, but I'm too 
cold to move! 
<end> 
<start>He got lucky... this time... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The Emperor just appeared out of 
nowhere! 
<end> 
<start>He's in Mizuchi's room acting all big. 
Is he an ex-Mantra? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I heard about the Emperor's true 
identity. 
<end> 
<start>But, how did a run-of-the-mill 
Jack Frost get so much power? 
<end> 
<start>Did he get a bunch of Magatsuhi 
from somewhere? ...Weird. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Hey brother, you here to play? 
We got young girls, so why don't 
you stop by? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]One customer, right up! Datsue, can 
you come over here? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Please, no window-shopping. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Hey brother, thanks again! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I look up to the Emperor, hee ho! 
<end> 
<start>The Emperor is Kabukicho's number 
one, hee ho! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You're...! 
<end> 
<start>...Wait up! I'm not dumb enough to 
go against you. 
<end> 
<start>I'll tell you something useful, so 
don't make that face, okay? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...C'mon, let bygones be bygones! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...Have you ever seen a Jack Frost 
named [2:FF02]Heeho[2:FF01]? 
<end> 
<start>I hear he has something to do with 
the Emperor... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]............ 
<end> 
<start>...I see. 
<end> 
<start>So, the Emperor WAS Heeho!? 
Wow! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Hee! Ho! Hee! Ho! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]~Hee ho the champion~ 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Praise the Emperor! 
<end> 
<start>Hee! Ho! Hee! Ho! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Please do not rush onto the train. 
The door is now closing. 
<start>[7:FF07]Yoyogi Park Station! 
Yoyogi Park Station! 
<start>[7:FF07]> You received a message. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You're late... You're way late, 
[12:FF01] [11:FF01]! 
<end> 
<start>You haven't forgotten that we're 
going to visit Ms. [11:FF02], 
have you? 
<end> 
<start>Hurry up and get over to 
Yoyogi Park. You're wasting 
my quality time! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It's from your classmate. 
<end> 
<start>> Enter his name. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I don't care if you come or not, 
but Ms. [11:FF02]'s nice to me 
when you're around... 
<end> 
<start>Oh yeah, you better make sure you 
look nice for her. 
<end> 
<start>How about the jacket you bought 
the other day... Y'know, the one 
with a demon graphic on it? 
<end> 
<start>You're just the mood maker. 
Don't forget that. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You see a vending machine! 
<end> 
<start>> You have enough change to buy 
a drink. 
<end> 
<start>> Will you buy something? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> The drink that came out isn't any of 
the ones listed. 
<end> 
<start>> You obtained a [2:FF05]Mysterious Drink[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You decided to hurry on ahead. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The vending machine is sold out. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...Huh??? A customer? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Are you heading to Yoyogi Park, 
too? 
<end> 
<start>After the incident, we've had a lot 
of lookee-loos, but not so many 
customers. 
<end> 
<start>Man, I've had a lot of free time 
on my hands... 
<end> 
<start>...Huh? Are you saying that 
you haven't heard the news??? 
<end> 
<start>What's going on? 
<start>[7:FF07]Hmmm... How should I put this? 
Yesterday, there was a [2:FF02]riot[2:FF01] at 
Yoyogi Park. 
<end> 
<start>If you want the details, you can 
check the giant screen. 
<end> 
<start>A buncha people were killed. 
You could hear the sirens wailing 
all night long. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Who hasn't, right? I mean, 
it's all over the news. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I'm sorry about that. I was 
so bored! I just needed someone 
to talk to. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I'm sorry about that... I shouldn't be 
talking on the job, even if I'm not 
busy... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Will you leave the area? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> There is a Mystical Chest. 
Will you open it? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> You did not open

<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]Yes, you say? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]No, you say? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> You landed in an unexpected 
location. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]First, please return the [2:FF02]Candelabrum 
of Foundation[2:FF01] to its rightful place. 
<end> 
<start>I will open the door leading to 
where the candelabrum must be 
returned. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...You can now proceed. 
<end> 
<start>I must warn you, though, 
that powerful demons roam 
the area ahead. 
<end> 
<start>Please be careful... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]If you go through the door behind 
you, you will find a pedestal.

<start>Once you retrieve the candelabrum, 
please set it on that pedestal.

<start>...I know you will be successful. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The voice of the lady in black 
can be heard through the peephole... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The lady's voice could no longer 
be heard.

<start>Yes.

<start>They're blocking me. 
<start>[7:FF07]I wanna go too, but I have no idea 
what to do! 
<end> 
<start>When I touched the glowing ball, 
everything felt different... 
<end> 
<start>For some reason, time felt like 
it was just flying by. 
<end> 
<start>It seems that the block lowers only 
on certain cycles of Kagutsuchi... 
<end> 
<start>Oh, yeah. If you take too much time, 
the blocks will fall and drop on you! 
<end> 
<start>If you figure it out, let me know. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Then, go home. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Hmmm...

<start>[7:FF07]Hahahahaha... 
<end> 
<start>Just as Lord Hikawa predicted... 
It seems a rat has wandered in! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Ohohoho... 
<end> 
<start>I assume you are here for that 
woman, but we three sisters are 
guarding the Obelisk... 
<end> 
<start>We are not like that useless Ose. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Ahaha... If you want her back, 
you must defeat us. 
<end> 
<start>Well, if you can get to us in 
the first place. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Kagutsuchi repeats the process of 
birth and death. It will not wait 
for you. 
<end> 
<start>Now... Come! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Ahaha... 
Hahahahaha... 
Ohohoho... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The women disappeared. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Hahahahaha... So, have you figured 
out how the puzzle works? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I am Clotho, the youngest of 
the Moirae Sisters. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I shall wind the thread of your life! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Hahahahaha... You don't give up, 
do you? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]If you like me that much, I can make 
you our lover... 
<end> 
<start>...But unfortunately, we have orders 
from Lord Hikawa. 
<end> 
<start>This time, I shall wind what's left of 
your life! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Ohohoho... I will not allow you 
past here. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I am Lachesis, the second of 
the Moirae Sisters. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I measure the length of life.

<start>Your thread is reaching its end! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Ohohoho... Persistent men are not 
well-liked, you know! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]It seems that my measurements 
were a little off... 
<end> 
<start>I shall end your life for sure 
this time! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Ahaha... Were you able to keep up 
with Kagutsuchi? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I am Atropos, the eldest of 
the Moirae Sisters. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]How unlucky of you to meet me. 
I cut the threads of fate... 
In other words... 
<end> 
<start>Your fate is already sealed! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Ahaha... You again? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Are you done with your prayers? 
I will cut off any attachments 
you have to this world! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Hahahahaha...! We aren't letting you 
pass that easily! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Do not underestimate us!

<start>[7:FF07]We three Moirae Sisters will... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Spin! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Measure! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]And snip your fate!! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> There is light coming from above. 
<end> 
<start>> Will you ascend? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained the Magatama 
[2:FF03]Djed[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> If you fall from here, you will lose 
your life. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> No one is here. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Will you go to the Tower of 
Kagutsuchi? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> You sense strong power from 
the floor above? 
<end> 
<start>> Will you go up? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> Will you leave the area? 
<end> 
<start>Yes.

System... 
<end> 
<start>............ 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]This tower is protected by 
the 'Moirae Sisters'. 
<end> 
<start>As long as they're here, you won't 
be able to catch even a glimpse of 
the Maiden. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Nooooo! The Moirae Sisters were... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The Moirae Sisters have set devices 
to stop intruders. 
<end> 
<start>You must control the flow of time. 
...What does that mean? You will 
soon find out... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]............ 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You must touch the glowing sphere 
and control time to deactivate 
the device ahead. 
<end> 
<start>But, if you take too much time, 
the floor will crumble beneath you. 
<end> 
<start>...A malevolent device, fitting of 
the Moirae Sisters. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Hmm... Those devices appear to be 
functioning, even though the sisters 
were defeated. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The pillar at the center of 
the Obelisk sends collected 
Magatsuhi to the bottom. 
<end> 
<start>You saw all that Magatsuhi being 
stored at the bottom, right? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]There's no more Magatsuhi flowing 
down the pillar... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Now that the Nightmare System has 
been activated, no one can stop 
the Assembly of Nihilo. 
<end> 
<start>The world of stillness is near... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The Nightmare System has been 
stopped... 
<end> 
<start>But, knowing Lord Hikawa, it 
probably isn't a problem for 
him... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Dang, there it is again... 
<end> 
<start>Do you hear it? The screaming of 
a woman, coming from above? 
<end> 
<start>...It's creepy! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Come to think of it, I stopped 
hearing that woman scream... 
<end> 
<start>...That's just as creepy! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]There must be some sort of pattern 
to the movement of these blocks... 
<end> 
<start>Is there anyplace where I can 
overlook the entire area? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Commander Hikawa will do anything 
to realize his creation. 
<end> 
<start>You never know... To him, even 
the Maiden may just be... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Below here is where the Nihilo hide 
all their treasure. 
<end> 
<start>But, no one who has gone looking 
for it has ever come back alive... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Go upstairs if you have business 
with the Maiden. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The Moirae Sisters are waiting on 
the floor above. 
<end> 
<start>I hope you enjoy being tortured to 
death... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You're not bad, defeating 
the Moirae Sisters. 
<end> 
<start>...Screw Hikawa, I should just follow 
you! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Everyone went up. I don't think 
you'll find a soul down below. 
<end> 
<start>...Still, that was some earthquake. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The Moirae Sisters... 
<end> 
<start>Clotho is the 'spinner'... 
Um, what was Lachesis? 
Atropos is the 'inevitable'... 
<end> 
<start>Hmmm... One spins the thread, 
the last one cuts it... 
<end> 
<start>...What goes in the middle? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I got it! 
<end> 
<start>Lachesis is the 'apportioner'! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]This is the Obelisk, 
<end> 
<start>the only place in Tokyo that is 
connected to Kagutsuchi. 
<end> 
<start>Everyone went upstairs... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The gate is tightly shut. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Will you leave the area? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> There is a Mystical Chest. 
Will you open it? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> You did not open 
the Mystical Chest. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 
[2:FF05][3:FF01][2:FF01] x [3:FF02]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You see a Cache Cube. 
Will you open it? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> You did not open 
the Cache Cube. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It's empty. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 
[2:FF05][3:FF01][2:FF01] x [3:FF02]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 
the Magatama [2:FF05][3:FF01][2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 
[2:FF05][3:FF01] Macca[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It's a trap. 
<end> 
<start>> Your party took damage. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It's empty. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> [3:FF03] found something. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]............ 
> You obtained 
[2:FF05][3:FF01][2:FF01] x [3:FF02]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It can't be used here. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The light effect wore off. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The repel effect wore off. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The attract effect wore off. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The levitation effect wore off. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Select a floor. 
<end> 
<start>[3:FF01][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF02][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF03][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF04][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF05][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF06][80EA] 
<start>[7:FF07]The temple up north is there to seal 
the 'Kimon' of Tokyo. 
<end> 
<start>But... What's a 'Kimon'? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...[12:FF01], 
can you hear me? 
<end> 
<start>I guess you made it to Ginza alright. 
<end> 
<start>You had me worried there... 
<end> 
<start>I lost track of you for a while, 
and I thought you may have gotten 
lost in the Amala Network... 
<end> 
<start>...Anyways, I'm glad to see 
that you're okay. 
<end> 
<start>So, can you look around Ginza 
and gather some info about Hikawa? 
<end> 
<start>You might run into tougher demons, 
but I'm sure you can handle them. 
<end> 
<start>I'm not cut out for fighting, 
so I'll track down Hikawa 
some other way. 
<end> 
<start>I'm sure we'll meet again, 
since we're both after 
the same thing. 
<end> 
<start>Alright then, see ya. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The voice could no longer 
be heard. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]...Hey, [12:FF01]! 
Looks like you're doing alright. 
<end> 
<start>How did you know I was here? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]I heard what Hikawa did. 
I didn't think he would wipe out 
the Mantra completely. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Man, that Nightmare System... 
It's more powerful than 
I ever imagined. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]But, I haven't given up just yet. 
If he makes a move, 
it may give us some clues. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Maybe we can figure out where 
the Nightmare System is located, 
or more about the Maiden... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]...It's too bad this terminal 
is under Nihilo's control. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]I can't do much digging without 
raising a red flag. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]We need to find a terminal that 
Nihilo doesn't know about... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Remember those Manikins that were 
enslaved by the Mantra? 
I heard they're rebuilding 
the town of [2:FF02]Asakusa[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Maybe there's a terminal over there 
that Nihilo's unaware of. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]With the Mantra out of the way, 
you should be able to get to 
Asakusa. It's way too dangerous 
for me to come along, though. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]I'll see what I can do 
with this terminal... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]...Wait a minute. 
I completely forgot about you. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Hey, do you feel like 
going to Asakusa? 
<end> 
<start>[18:]If you can get there and contact me 
through the Amala Network, 
it'll make my job much easier. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]I'm sure you're strong enough 
to make it to Asakusa. 
So... will you do it for me? 
<end> 
<start>Okay. 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Thanks, I appreciate it. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]I'll tell you everything 
I find out there, 
so let's stay in touch, alright? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Oh, come on. You're not gonna let 
Nihilo have things their way, 
are you? 
<end> 
<start>[18:]I'll tell you everything 
I find out there... 
about Nihilo and the Maiden. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Most importantly, 
we have to stop Hikawa. 
So, you're going. Case closed. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]I'll be waiting, then. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]You should check out the tunnel 
in [2:FF02]East Ikebukuro[2:FF01]. 
If the rumor is true, 
it'll take you to Asakusa. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]I'll be working on this terminal, 
but you'll probably have more luck 
than me. I'm counting on ya. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]There's supposed to be a tunnel 
connecting East Ikebukuro 
and Asakusa. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]I'll be working on this terminal, 
but it's mostly up to you. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]I hope we can track down Nihilo. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF06]Welcome to Rag's Jewelry. 
<end> 
<start>Mmmm, you smell strongly of gems. 
<end> 
<start>You've come to the right place. 
Heh heh heh...

<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...Do you still not understand? 
<end> 
<start>There was not really freedom. 
All that existed was greed, 
and that is what corrupted 
the world. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Freedom? Possibility? 
If you truly believe in them, 
then why do you seek 
the way of creation? 
<end> 
<start>Were they not present-- 
abundant, more accurately-- 
in the previous world? 
<end> 
<start>Why did you not pursue 
your goal back then? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]I-I... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]The same is true for you. 
What did you expect to achieve 
by sending your students 
to this world? 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Did you think they would be able 
to do what you couldn't? 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Or, did you want them to feel 
the same agony of defeat that 
you felt? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Do you know why you've been 
unable to obtain your Reason? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]All this time, 
you've just been running away... 
trying to leave everything behind. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Tell me the truth... 
Do you really believe in freedom? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Your choice to believe in Shijima, 
human, is a type of freedom itself. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Aradia... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]So it was you who sided 
with [12:FF02]. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Don't bother trying to interfere. 
You are powerless 
within this warded area. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Just watch quietly as my god 
descends from above. 
<end> 
<start>Message test 8-2 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...This land will be no more. 
<end> 
<start>Woman, we shall set out for 
the new land. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]No... I won't go. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]I have to stop Hikawa, or else... 
both the previous world and 
the new world will die. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I shall await you there, woman. 
Remember that hope is the way. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]How pitiful... 
Deceived, and now abandoned by 
a false god. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]This space will be consumed by 
the nothingness shortly. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Now, sacrifice yourself to my god 
and fulfill your duty as 
the Maiden... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...!! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Who disturbs us!? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]It's quite a surprise to see 
you here, Demi-fiend. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]I don't know what you were 
thinking, but... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]I have no intention 
of fighting you. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Now, I'd appreciate it if 
you'd stand aside and cease 
with the interruptions... 
<end> 
<start>...Alright. 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]I am deeply disappointed in you. 
How can you allow yourself to be 
swayed by this woman...? 
<end> 
<start>[18:]I've left you alone thus far, 
but now there is no point in 
letting you live. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]My faithful servant [2:FF02]Samael[2:FF01] 
will take care of you. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Message test 9-7 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]I'm glad that you understand. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]This is the moment that the world 
has been waiting for... 
the coming of the divine guardian 
of Shijima. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]You defeated Samael? 
Your prowess is simply astounding. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]But, it's too late. 
You cannot stop the advent 
of my god. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Behold... 
I wield the power of [2:FF02]Ahriman[2:FF01], 
god of the void. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Guided by the wisdom of god, 
I shall create a new world, 
the kingdom of stillness. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Eternal prosperity is possible 
through my power alone... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:][12:FF01]... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]All possibility has dried up 
in this world... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]But, there must be a world 
out there where freedom prevails... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]I wasn't strong enough, but... 
it seems your will is greater. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]...Use this, and create the world 
that you want... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Hurry... to Amala Temple... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]This will show you the way 
to Kagutsuchi... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]The pilgrimage to creation 
ends there... 
<end> 
<start>If you so desire, 
<end> 
<start>[18:]you may create a world 
of freedom... 
however you see fit... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained the [2:FF02]Yahirono Himorogi[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...Hi, [12:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[18:][7:FF07]I heard about the trial by combat, 
and I thought it might be you 
who was the winner. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Getting here was tough, 
to say the least... 
but I'm glad I made it. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:][12:FF01]... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]There's something I want to tell you. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]I decided to play by the rules 
of this world. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]You know what the purpose of 
this new world is, right? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]I... I want to try my hand 
at the creation. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]...You probably think I'm crazy. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]But, I remembered that voice... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]...that voice I heard when 
the world changed... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]You must've heard it too, 
[12:FF01], 
since you survived. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]...After we went our separate ways, 
I started thinking. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Not just about what I have to do 
in this world, 
<end> 
<start>[18:]but why the world ended up like this. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]And then, I realized... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]...that there were too many 
unnecessary things occupying 
the previous world. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]There were lots of things, 
and lots of people... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]But, nothing new was being made. 
Time passed, and nothing changed. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]What the world really needed... 
it was not getting. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]...It's true that I lost everything. 
It was the saddest thing imaginable. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]But, I survived the Conception. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]I was chosen... 
That's what I'm going to believe, 
and now, I have to look forward. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]I still feel a great sadness 
in my heart... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]but if I can swallow it down... 
endless possibilities await... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]The power of creation... 
will be mine. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]"Choose," the voice said to me. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]The world doesn't need any more 
worthless things... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]That's why I want to create 
my ideal society, 
<end> 
<start>[18:]a paradise ruled by the strong, 
the chosen... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]The world of Yosuga. 
<end> 
<start>[18:][12:FF01], 
you've fought your way this far. 
You know what I'm saying, 
don't you? 
<end> 
<start>Yeah, I get it. 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]...I'm happy to hear that. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]I knew you'd understand, 
[12:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]I might ask you to help me out, 
then. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]...That's too bad. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]I was hoping you'd understand. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]But, no matter what you say, 
I won't change my mind. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]...I see. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]But I believe in you, 
[12:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]I believe that one day 
you'll come to accept it. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]I'm going to start collecting 
Magatsuhi. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Honestly, I don't know where 
to begin... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]But, since Yosuga is the Reason 
of the strong, I'll see what 
I can do on my own first. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]...I'm glad we had the chance 
to talk today. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]We both survived the Conception... 
I'm sure we'll cross paths again. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]See you later, [12:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][6:FF01]What can I do for you, hee ho? 
<start>[7:FF07][6:FF01]What do you want, hee ho? 
<start>[7:FF07][6:FF01]How many do you want, hee ho? 
<start>[7:FF07][6:FF01]What do you want to sell, hee ho? 
<start>[7:FF07][6:FF01]How many are you selling, hee ho? 
<start>[7:FF07][6:FF01]You already have enough, hee ho. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][6:FF01]It'll be a total of [2:FF05][3:FF04] Macca[2:FF01]. 
Are you sure, hee ho? 
<start>[7:FF07][6:FF01]You're super rich, hee ho! 
<end> 
<start>I'll keep what doesn't fit  
in your wallet! 
It'll be for my training. 
<end> 
<start>Do you still want to sell,  
hee ho? 
<start>[7:FF07][6:FF01]Hee ho!  
Thanks a bunch! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][6:FF01]Do you still need something, 
hee ho? 
<start>[7:FF07][6:FF01]I caught a weird looking thing 
the other day. It looks like  
a bug, but it's a demon, hee ho! 
<end> 
<start>It's probably really, really rare!  
That's why I'm selling it, hee ho. 
<end> 
<start>...I don't like  
[2:FF03]Shiranui[2:FF01]... 
<end> 
<start>Please buy it, hee ho! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][6:FF01]...I want to go on my journey,  
hee ho. 
<end> 
<start>I'm going to become a super-cool, 
and super-strong demon! 
<end> 
<start>So, can you help me out by buying 
lots of stuff, hee ho? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][6:FF01]I caught a weird looking thing  
the other day. It looks like  
a bug, but it's a demon, hee ho! 
<end> 
<start>It's probably really, really rare! 
That's why I'm selling it, hee ho. 
<end> 
<start>Please buy it, hee ho! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][6:FF01]This is a dummy. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][6:FF01]This is a dummy. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][6:FF01]This is a dummy. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][6:FF01]This is a dummy. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][6:FF01]This is a dummy. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][6:FF01]This is a dummy. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][6:FF01]This is a dummy. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][6:FF01]This is a dummy. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][6:FF01]This is a dummy. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][6:FF01]This is a dummy. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][6:FF01]Come again, hee ho! 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07][6:FF01]Thanks for buying over  
1000 Macca worth of stuff! 
<end> 
<start>Here's a service ticket 
for you! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][6:FF01]Oh, you have ten tickets. 
<end> 
<start>Okey-dokey, pick any box you like!  
I'll give you what's inside it. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][6:FF01]You obtained [2:FF05][3:FF04][2:FF01]! 
<end> 
<start>Big box. 
<start>Dummy. 
<end> 
<start>Dummy. 
<start>Dummy. 
<end> 
<start>Dummy. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Oh, it's you... 
<end> 
<start>...What a surprise. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]It's been a while since we last met, 
young man... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Or should I say, "Demi-fiend"? 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Frankly, it never crossed my mind 
before... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]But, it seems we were destined 
to meet again. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I accumulated enough Magatsuhi 
for creation when I destroyed 
the Mantra. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]That's why I didn't stop you 
from going to the Obelisk. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]I also wanted to verify that 
you were truly the Demi-fiend. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]However, not only did you defeat 
my subordinates, 
but you single-handedly set 
the Maiden free. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]The strength of the Demi-fiend, 
as written in the Scripture 
of Miroku... 
It was beyond my expectations. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]You might be able to aid me 
in delivering Shijima to the world... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]...A man's greed is like fire. 
While it is small, it is warm 
and comfortable. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]But, fire eventually grows 
into flames, devouring everything 
in its path. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Mankind grew to covet fire. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Humans became dependent on 
its warmth, and averted their eyes 
from its destructive nature. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Humans should serve the world. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]By doing so, a life of repose 
would in turn be promised to them. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]What is desirable, 
what is undesirable... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]It is not man that makes 
the distinction... 
It is the world. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Humans should be beacons 
that light the world. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]The light spins quietly-- 
sometimes bright, sometimes dim-- 
becoming one with the world. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]That is the ideal way of life. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Don't you agree, 
that the world should be ruled 
by serenity...? 
<end> 
<start>Yes, it should. 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]So, you understand the greatness 
of Shijima? 
<end> 
<start>[18:]...You are on a different level 
than the masses, as I suspected. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]I will ask for your assistance 
when the time comes. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]...So, you are a mere demon 
after all. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]I was wrong to think that you would 
understand my ideal. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]...It is now time for us to part. 
[18:]<end> 
<start>I will not feel at ease until 
all this is over. 
<end> 
<start>Do you not sense something wicked 
in the air? 
[18:]<end> 
<start>Someone is scheming to ignite 
the ember that still glows within 
the remains of Gozu-Tennoh. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I must not falter while others 
strive to establish their foolish 
Reasons... 
<end> 
<start>It is I who will create 
the new world! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...I feel it. I feel the power... 
A candelabrum is nearby! 
<start>[7:FF07]...Hey! It's you, isn't it!? 
<start>[7:FF07]Hand over the candelabrum! 
Be a good boy, and I'll take you to 
a world without limits!! 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 
the [2:FF02]Candelabrum of Dignity[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...A world that loses its power will 
fade away into nothingness. 
<end> 
<start>If such is the fate of this world, 
<end> 
<start>then I shall return it to its mother's 
womb. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The world must first die, 
for it to be born again... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...That is the only way to salvation, 
as recorded in an ancient prophecy. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The world will fall for its sins, 
and humans will all disappear... 
<end> 
<start>But, I don't want you to meet 
the same fate. 
<end> 
<start>I want to help you hold on to 
your life. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]To do so, I need to know your 
name. 
<end> 
<start>Will you tell me who you are...? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...... 
<end> 
<start>I see, so your name is 
[12:FF01] [11:FF01]... 
<end> 
<start>As of now, your will to live shall be 
sustained. 
<end> 
<start>Believe in it... and live. 
<end> 
<start>I will. 
<start>[7:FF07]I'm glad that you understand. 
<end> 
<start>The time is near... 
It will take place very soon. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You may not understand right now... 
<end> 
<start>...but please don't forget what 
you've heard here... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I am the nurturer of the next world. 
<end> 
<start>It is my duty to create the world 
that is to come... 
<end> 
<start>Now, I want you to say my name 
out loud. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]That's right... My name is 
[12:FF02] [11:FF02]. 
<end> 
<start>...[12:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>I won't shed another tear, 
not even at the world's end. 
<end> 
<start>I'd like to see you in the next world, 
though... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Go ahead and wake up. It's time... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]In what persona will you walk 
your path? 
<end> 
<start>Hooded jacket. 
<start>[7:FF07]You prefer a new look, then? 
I'm sure you'll like it. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You want to stay the same as 
before? There's nothing wrong 
with that. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]You have come at last... 
I knew that fate would bring 
you here. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]This is the farthest region of Amala... 
Humans call it the netherworld. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]I am sure you are already aware, 
but many formidable demons lurk 
in this dark land. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]This place is home to those 
who were cast down by god. 
They await the day when 
they can fly once again. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:][13:FF01], the young man 
with the power of a demon... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]You are still weak and unable to 
withstand the flow of Magatsuhi 
in Amala. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]You may be wondering how it is 
that you arrived here and if 
you are in danger, but do not worry. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]We will send you to your original 
destination. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]You may not understand right now, 
<end> 
<start>[18:]but everything-- 
the meaning behind my words, 
the purpose of your existence-- 
<end> 
<start>[18:]...will be clear when the time comes. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]It is time for you to return 
to Tokyo. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]There is nothing you can 
accomplish here right now. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]At this point, you still lack 
the strength. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]But, allow me to give you this. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]This [2:FF02]candelabrum[2:FF01] will be 
your guide... 
<end> 
<start>[18:]...when you lose your way 
in your quest for power. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]> You obtained 
the [2:FF02]Candelabrum of Sovereignty[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Then, I will send you to Ginza. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]We shall meet again, 
if fate so desires... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:][13:FF01]... 
a young man with the power 
of a demon. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]You have arrived at 
the [2:FF02]Labyrinth of Amala[2:FF01] 
because of your power. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]Would you like to explore this realm 
for a while? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Normally this would be not be 
permitted, but I will make 
an exception for you. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Allow me to give you this. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]This [2:FF02]candelabrum[2:FF01] can be used 
to illuminate the Labyrinth. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]By placing it in the appropriate 
location, you will be able to 
delve deeper into the Labyrinth. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]> You obtained 
the [2:FF02]Candelabrum of Foundation[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]Then, please enjoy the Labyrinth, 
also known as the netherworld... 
<end> 
<start>I will be awaiting your arrival 
at the very bottom. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Oh dear, Aradia has entered 
this world. 
<end> 
<start>This can only mean trouble, 
my little master. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Be very thankful. 
<end> 
<start>My little master has given me 
permission to enlighten you. 
<end> 
<start>Listen closely to what I am 
about to tell you. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The time of creation for 
this Vortex World is near. 
<end> 
<start>War will erupt amongst those who 
spread their Reason in hopes of 
shaping the new world. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]As a demon, you are forbidden 
to conceive your own Reason... 
<end> 
<start>Which Reason will you side with? 
Which will you oppose? 
Will the Reason you choose 
persevere, or fail? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Your suffering is my little 
master's delight. 
Struggle as hard as you can. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You are free to follow 
whichever Reason you like. 
<end> 
<start>My only wish is that you do not 
disappoint my little master with 
a dull ending... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The child and the old woman 
disappeared... 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> Add which candelabrum to 
inventory? 
<end> 
<start>Knowledge 
<start>[7:FF07]What do you want to do? 
<end> 
<start>Black Visor flag on 
<start>Black Visor flag on 
<start>[7:FF07]> There is a huge pedestal. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You do not have a candelabrum 
for this pedestal... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Will you light the [2:FF02]Candelabrum 
of Knowledge[2:FF01]? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Will you light the [2:FF02]Candelabrum 
of Majesty[2:FF01]? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Will you light the [2:FF02]Candelabrum 
of Beauty[2:FF01]? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Will you light the [2:FF02]Candelabrum 
of Godliness[2:FF01]? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> You lit the [2:FF02]Candelabrum 
of Knowledge[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You lit the [2:FF02]Candelabrum 
of Majesty[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You lit the [2:FF02]Candelabrum 
of Beauty[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You lit the [2:FF02]Candelabrum 
of Godliness[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> All of the candelabra 
have been lit... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The flames illuminate the passage 
beyond. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> There is a peephole... 
<end> 
<start>> Will you look through it? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Please visit us at the deepest part 
of the Labyrinth. 
<end> 
<start>...We will be waiting. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Have you changed your mind? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Then, we will be waiting in 
the deepest part of the Labyrinth. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]I will open the way to the last 
door. Please use the candelabrum 
and come see us. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]We look forward to seeing you 
soon. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]There is still time... 
If you decide to help my master, 
please come back to this place. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]We will be waiting for you. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The voice of the lady in black 
can be heard through the peephole... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The lady's voice could no longer 
be heard. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Will you proceed down the corridor? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Will you go back? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The hole is blocked... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The path is blocked... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> There is a shaft leading downward. 
<end> 
<start>> Jump in? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Return to the entrance 
of the Labyrinth? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Return to the previous Kalpa? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> There is a shaft leading downward. 
<end> 
<start>> Jump in? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> There is a tombstone without 
a name on it... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Will you put on the Black Visor? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The inscription on the tombstone 
changed. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The inscription on the tombstone 
remained the same. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> "Record of Specter: 
Defeated in [3:FF01] turn(s)." 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> "Record of Specter: 
Defeated in [2:FF02][3:FF01][2:FF01] turn(s)." 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It is inscribed, 
"Here lies Specter." 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You recall the battle against 
Specter... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> "Record of Sakahagi: 
Defeated in [3:FF01] turn(s)." 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> "Record of Sakahagi: 
Defeated in [2:FF02][3:FF01][2:FF01] turn(s)." 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It is inscribed, 
"Here lies Sakahagi." 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You recall the battle against 
Sakahagi... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> "Record of Aciel: 
Defeated in [3:FF01] turn(s)." 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> "Record of Aciel: 
Defeated in [2:FF02][3:FF01][2:FF01] turn(s)." 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It is inscribed, 
"Here lies Aciel." 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You recall the battle against 
Aciel... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> "Record of Skadi: 
Defeated in [3:FF01] turn(s)." 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> "Record of Skadi: 
Defeated in [2:FF02][3:FF01][2:FF01] turn(s)." 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It is inscribed, 
"Here lies Skadi." 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You recall the battle against 
Skadi... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> "Record of Albion: 
Defeated in [3:FF01] turn(s)." 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> "Record of Albion: 
Defeated in [2:FF02][3:FF01][2:FF01] turn(s)." 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It is inscribed, 
"Here lies Albion." 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You recall the battle against 
Albion... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]What's the matter, sonny? 
What's your hurry? 
<end> 
<start>Everybody runs right by here just 
like you, not even giving a second 
glance to a poor old guy on the side 
of the road. 
<end> 
<start>It's a shame what this world's 
coming to... You folks oughtta get 
your priorities straight. 
<end> 
<start>Ya see, sometimes you just need to 
relax and pay no heed to the time. 
<end> 
<start>Don't you agree? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]What!? You didn't listen to me 
one single bit! Come back when 
you're not in such a hurry. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Here ya are again. 
Let me ask you the same question... 
<end> 
<start>Sometimes, you just need to relax 
and pay no heed to the time. 
<end> 
<start>Don't you agree? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Oh... I can see that you've been 
listening. 
<end> 
<start>You're in a hurry, aren't ya? 
You should be on your way. 
<end> 
<start>Come back anytime if you'd like to 
talk to me again. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]It's nice to see ya again, sonny. 
<end> 
<start>...You're still in a hurry, 
aren't ya? You should be on 
your way, then. Don't worry, 
we can talk some other time. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Too bad you don't agree, though 
your manner says otherwise. 
I hope you change your mind. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]It's a pity that we don't see 
eye to eye. But, maybe you'll 
come around to my way of thinkin'. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Work hard every day... 
That's how people should lead 
their lives. 
<end> 
<start>I contributed to society 
by doing just that. 
<end> 
<start>My company grew as a result, 
and became highly regarded. 
<end> 
<start>Do you think my life was a success? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...That's what everybody else 
thought, too. People envied me 
for my fortune... until that 
one day... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]For the first time in my life, 
I had the urge to kill. 
<end> 
<start>So much anger... All because of 
that boy... Even to this day, 
I still ache for revenge. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...Of course, I didn't have the balls 
to do anything about it back then, 
when I was still playing by 
society's rules. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I see... Yeah, you might be right. 
<end> 
<start>Just when I thought I'd achieved 
happiness, my fortune collapsed 
like a house of cards. 
<end> 
<start>You should be careful. 
You never know what tomorrow 
may bring... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...So much time has passed, 
yet my soul still burns with rage. 
<end> 
<start>I should have taken revenge back 
then, for what that boy did to me. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I sense that you have power 
beyond that possessed by 
an ordinary demon. 
<end> 
<start>Would you be willing to lead my 
wandering soul to salvation? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You rang the [2:FF02]Afterlife Bell[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>> Its pure tone fills the air... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Ah... 
<end> 
<start>I can see... my black heart... 
A new shape surrounds it... 
<end> 
<start>I am in a place... that gives rise 
to many demons... 
<end> 
<start>...... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The soul vanished... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]What was I thinking? 
No demon would have that kind 
of power. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...You're a strange-looking demon. 
I got a question for you. 
<end> 
<start>Do you think it's wrong to kill 
until your heart's content? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Heh, whatever. 
You sound just like a human. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Actually, humans can be crueler 
than you think, even crueler 
than demons... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I knew you'd understand. 
Yeah, I killed lots of humans 
when I was still alive. 
<end> 
<start>They're all the same... 
Just flesh and blood under 
a thin layer of skin. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]But, to tell you the truth... 
Deep down inside, I've always 
wondered what it'd be like to 
feel warmth and kindness... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I lived my life causing nothing but 
pain and suffering for others... 
<end> 
<start>I never felt bad about it, 
and I don't regret living that way, 
either. 
<end> 
<start>But... when I met that girl, 
the words just slipped out of 
my mouth... 
<end> 
<start>"Everybody has kindness in 
their heart." 
<end> 
<start>Why the hell did I say that? 
<end> 
<start>Maybe I was just curious what 
warmth and kindness feel like... 
<end> 
<start>If I could live my life again, 
I... I'd wanna be the kind of person 
who is liked by everyone. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Damn it, what am I saying? 
Why am I getting all emotional...? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You're really one weird demon. 
I've never told anyone about 
these feelings before. 
<end> 
<start>Hey, by any chance... Would you be 
able to guide my soul from here? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You rang the [2:FF02]Afterlife Bell[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>> Its pure tone fills the air... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I guess it's time to say goodbye 
to this place... 
<end> 
<start>The part of my soul that I was 
missing... The "me" that I really 
wanted to become... 
<end> 
<start>It's gonna wait with other demons 
for a new life... 
<end> 
<start>...... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The soul vanished... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I see... 
Forget what I just said, will ya? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> There is a switch. 
Will you activate it? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The switch has been activated. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Gee, you look worn out. 
<end> 
<start>Would you like to rest for a while? 
Only 500 Macca! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Oh... Well, please come again! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Oh, you don't have enough Macca... 
Come back when you do. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You must be thirsty. 
Here, have a drink... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Your party recovered. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Go ahead, have some more... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Are you feeling better? 
Here's some more... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Your party recovered some more. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...Have... another... drink... 
<start>[7:FF07]> Your wallet feels really light... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Will you leave the area? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> There is a Mystical Chest. 
Will you open it? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> You did not open 
the Mystical Chest. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 
[2:FF05][3:FF01][2:FF01] x [3:FF02]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You see a Cache Cube. 
Will you open it? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> You did not open 
the Cache Cube. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It's empty. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 
[2:FF05][3:FF01][2:FF01] x [3:FF02]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 
the Magatama [2:FF05][3:FF01][2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 
[2:FF05][3:FF01] Macca[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It's a trap. 
<end> 
<start>> Your party took damage. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It's empty. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> [3:FF03] found something. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]............ 
> You obtained 
[2:FF05][3:FF01][2:FF01] x [3:FF02]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It can't be used here. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The light effect wore off. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The repel effect wore off. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The attract effect wore off. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The levitation effect wore off. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Select a floor. 
<end> 
<start>[3:FF01][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF02][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF03][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF04][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF05][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF06][80EA] 
<start>[7:FF07]> The door is locked... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You used the [2:FF02]Star Key[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The path is blocked... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> A strong presence can be felt 
from behind the door. 
<end> 
<start>> Will you enter? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]OUR LEADER'S ROOM IS THERE!! 
<end> 
<start>BE CAREFUL!! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Y-YOU DEFEATED OUR LEADER!? 
WOW!! 
<end> 
<start>THEN, YOU SHOULD LOOK FOR 
THE [2:FF02]STAR KEY[2:FF01]! 
<end> 
<start>IT CAN UNLOCK 
THE GOLDEN DOORS. 
<end> 
<start>IT'S SOMEWHERE IN THIS 
LABYRINTH, WHERE IT 
USED TO BE CURSED... 
<end> 
<start>THERE'S ANOTHER DEMON 
WHO KNOWS WHERE IT IS. 
<end> 
<start>IF YOU CAN GET THE STAR KEY, 
MAYBE YOU CAN MAKE IT TO 
THE BOTTOM! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]This is a prison for souls... 
<end> 
<start>Once you're inside, 
you can never get out. 
<end> 
<start>But, if you do find a way out, 
please let me know! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]"The sound of the bell unites 
a soul and a body..." 
<end> 
<start>There was a guy who managed 
to escape this prison, 
and that's what he used to say. 
<end> 
<start>I wonder what he's doing now... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Look, another demon who got lost 
in this prison. 
<end> 
<start>Do you think he can find his way 
out of here? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I don't know... 
<end> 
<start>He'll probably give up, and then 
run home and cry about it. 
<end> 
<start>*chuckle* 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Come on, he can't do that. 
<end> 
<start>Think about it. How can he run 
home if he doesn't know where 
the exit is? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Oh... That's true. 
<end> 
<start>...So, this poor demon's lost 
and he's all alone? How sad. 
<end> 
<start>...Hey, you there. If you wanna 
go home, head north. You'll find 
your way out of here eventually. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The two souls resumed their 
conversation... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Oh, you're sooo close! 
You're bound to find the exit 
any minute now. 
<end> 
<start>But, which way is it...? 
North or south, east or west...? 
Good luck finding it. 
<end> 
<start>By the way, 
I know exactly where it is. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Don't get too close! It's dangerous! 
<end> 
<start>...Just kidding. 
<end> 
<start>You think this is the exit? 
<end> 
<start>There was a guy who escaped from 
here, with something he called 
the [2:FF02]Afterlife Bell[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>He was saying that the bell has 
the power to resurrect the dead. 
<end> 
<start>If that's true, I wonder if he's 
come back to life in a cemetery 
somewhere... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Man, I should've tagged along. 
If only I'd known that there's 
a way out... 
<end> 
<start>I wonder if he's come back to life 
in a cemetery somewhere... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]No one can escape from this prison. 
<end> 
<start>You might as well give up all hope. 
<end> 
<start>Just look at me... 
I'm going absolutely nowhere... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]There are two souls with 
extraordinary power 
imprisoned here. 
<end> 
<start>Have you talked to either of them? 
<end> 
<start>Oddly enough, it feels like 
I've met them somewhere before... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]It's natural for every living thing 
to die... Treatment, therefore, 
contradicts nature. 
<end> 
<start>So... Did you come here to defy 
nature and be treated? 
<end> 
<start>No. 
<start>[7:FF07]Good. One lives, one dies... 
That's the way it should be. 
<end> 
<start>I pray that you find rest soon. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...I am a doctor, after all. 
I'll treat your wounds. 
<end> 
<start>But, I'm gonna charge you 
[3:FF01] Macca. Alright? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> ...... 
<end> 
<start>> Dr. Dark healed your party. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...... 
<end> 
<start>Money first. Get outta here. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Turn back! Right now! 
It's dangerous ahead! 
<end> 
<start>Not only is it dangerous, 
it's VERY dangerous!! 
<end> 
<start>I mean, it's EXTREMELY 
dangerous!!! 
<end> 
<start>If you still insist on going, 
I won't try to stop you, but... 
<end> 
<start>Make sure you go straight. 
Don't ever, ever turn left! 
Okay? 
<end> 
<start>...Please believe me. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]It was dangerous ahead! 
<end> 
<start>It was VERY dangerous!! 
<end> 
<start>I mean, it was EXTREMELY 
dangerous!!! 
<end> 
<start>...It's a thing of the past, though. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The cursed areas in this Labyrinth 
were created by the Wicked King, 
who's in the room ahead. 
<end> 
<start>The curse will be lifted if 
the king is defeated, so... 
<end> 
<start>If, by some miracle, you manage 
to defeat him, you might want to 
go back and revisit each Kalpa. 
<end> 
<start>You know those golden doors 
that are in different parts 
of the Labyrinth? 
<end> 
<start>I heard there's a guy who knows 
how to open them. 
<end> 
<start>If you're lucky, 
maybe you'll run into him. 
<end> 
<start>...Of course, I highly doubt 
that you'll last long against 
the Wicked King, let alone 
defeat him. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The curse has been lifted. 
<end> 
<start>That means the Wicked King 
has been defeated, but... 
<end> 
<start>Who could it have been? 
...It wasn't you, was it? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Oh, I'm so in love with our leader! 
<end> 
<start>...Who is he? Sorry, I can't 
give out his name. But... 
<end> 
<start>He's so noble, we call him 
the Lord of the Flies! 
<end> 
<start>I can't stop thinking about him... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]We call the corridor ahead 
the 12 Meters of Eternity. 
<end> 
<start>It's only a short distance 
to the other side, 
but every time you enter, 
you end up somewhere else... 
<end> 
<start>You'll see what I mean once 
you try it yourself... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]To continue on, just go down 
that ladder. 
<end> 
<start>If you want to go back, 
then return through 
the 12 Meters of Eternity. 
<end> 
<start>It's really strange... 
From the other side, the phase 
of Kagutsuchi determines where 
you'll end up, 
<end> 
<start>but from this side, you can only 
return to the entrance. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Too bad! 
<end> 
<start>This is a dead end. 
You spent all that precious time 
coming here for nothing. 
<end> 
<start>Just so you know, there's a place 
nearby that looks like a dead end, 
but you can actually go through it. 
<end> 
<start>Have fun looking for it. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I think you need to activate that 
switch over there to continue. 
<end> 
<start>It looks like you can get to 
the other side from the Kalpa above, 
so... 
<end> 
<start>Why don't you try to make your way 
across? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Hey, you activated the switch. 
<end> 
<start>Now, you can move on. Good luck! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...I'm glad you made it here. 
<end> 
<start>...If you get stronger, 
<end> 
<start>...I'll sell you something special. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...I've got nothing else 
to sell you. 
...Hey, don't worry. 
<end> 
<start>I'm sure there are other brokers 
besides me in this Labyrinth. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...You're pretty strong. 
<end> 
<start>...I'll sell you something special. 
Interested? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...On second thought, 
forget what I just said. 
<end> 
<start>The demon you have there... 
Yeah, the one that has colorful 
wings... 
<end> 
<start>As long as you've got that demon 
with you, I can't sell you mine. 
Come back after you get rid of it. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...You're pretty strong. 
<end> 
<start>I'll sell you something special. 
<end> 
<start>Uh... Wait a minute, 
your party's full. 
<end> 
<start>If you want a new companion, 
make some room first and then 
come back. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Here's what I'm selling... 
<end> 
<start>...a demon that wields an assortment 
of powerful attack spells. 
<end> 
<start>It's a charming and dependable 
companion! 
<end> 
<start>I'm asking 50000 Macca. 
I know it's kinda high, 
but it's well worth the price... 
So, you want it? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Here's what I'm selling... 
<end> 
<start>...a demon that is exceptionally 
tough. 
<end> 
<start>It's practically impervious 
to any form of attack! 
<end> 
<start>I'm asking 100000 Macca. 
I know it's kinda high, 
but it's well worth the price... 
So, you want it? 
<end> 
<start>Alright, I'll buy it. 
<start>[7:FF07]Excellent choice! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You purchased a demon from 
the Shady Broker. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I am Kaja Mitama. 
<end> 
<start>With my magic, I can 
weaken the enemy. 
<end> 
<start>Nice to meet you. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The demon joined your party. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]That's fine. 
If you change your mind, 
feel free to come back anytime. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Hey hey hey, you don't have 
enough Macca. 
<end> 
<start>Come back when you have more 
money, okay? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Have you been through 
the 12 Meters of Eternity yet? 
<end> 
<start>It can take you to different places 
like the vault or the maze, but... 
<end> 
<start>I'm warning you, don't go 
through it when Kagutsuchi 
shines the weakest. 
<end> 
<start>...Why? Whaddya mean, "Why?"! 
If you wander into 
the Wicked King's room, 
you won't come out alive! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Have you been through 
the 12 Meters of Eternity yet? 
<end> 
<start>It can take you to different places 
like the vault or the maze, but... 
<end> 
<start>I'm warning you, don't go 
through it when Kagutsuchi 
shines the weakest. 
<end> 
<start>...Why? Whaddya mean, "Why?"! 
If you wander into 
the Wicked King's room, 
you won't come out alive! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Have you been using the shafts 
that connect the Kalpa? 
<end> 
<start>I heard that your innate abilities, 
such as your agility and strength, 
affect your performance in there. 
<end> 
<start>If you plan on collecting Macca 
in there, then you might want to 
train yourself first. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]If you have any Deathstones 
in your possession... 
<end> 
<start>then you can call forth the deaths 
that you have conquered, just as 
you have created new demons. 
<end> 
<start>It all depends on the light of 
Kagutsuchi, though... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The door has been deformed 
and will not open... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The vending machine isn't 
working. 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]You got a Golua Cola! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You gave up on a Golua Cola. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The entrance is closed tight. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Dang! 
<end> 
<start>I came here to sell medicine, 
and now I get dragged into 
all this rubbish. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I saw it!! I saw a human go 
underground!! 
<end> 
<start>It's him... This is his doing!! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]............ 
<end> 
<start>What the hell happened!? 
<end> 
<start>Isn't this Tokyo!? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I-I-In the annex, I saw a d-demon... 
<end> 
<start>I-I-I-I have no idea what's 
going on... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...........Blarg? 
............Gaah? 
<end> 
<start>Maga...tsuhi...? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]We don't have any Magatsuhi 
to give to the likes of you! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]If you don't wanna get hurt... 
Give us the [2:FF02]Pass-thingie[2:FF01]!! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Blarg!! Gaah!!! 
<end> 
<start>Magatsuhi!! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained an [2:FF02]Annex Gate Pass[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Hmmm... You're stronger than 
I thought! 
<end> 
<start>But, you could get even stronger if 
you [2:FF02]talk[2:FF01] to other demons and 
get them on your side. 
<end> 
<start>We got the Pass-thingie, so let's 
head over to Yoyogi Park! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I've never seen a demon like you 
before... 
<end> 
<start>Are you looking for something, too? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]Is that so...? 
<end> 
<start>Denied again! I wonder if 
a strong demon would ever pass by 
here... *sigh* 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Oh, you're here again! 
<end> 
<start>You ARE looking for something, 
aren't you??? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Hey, about that thing you're 
looking for... 
<end> 
<start>I'll help you, if you want! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I was looking for something, too! 
<end> 
<start>A demon who can help take me to 
[2:FF02]Yoyogi Park[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>You look kinda flabby and weak, 
but I'll let that slide. 
<end> 
<start>Whaddya say? Should we join up? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Alright then, let's get outta here! 
<end> 
<start>If we have the [2:FF02]Pass-thingie[2:FF01], we can 
get through that door to the annex. 
<end> 
<start>I saw some [2:FF02]Pretas[2:FF01] carrying it. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...I'm Pixie the Fairy. I'm sure 
we'll be the best of friends! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Pixie joined your party! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...Is that so? 
<end> 
<start>I guess I'll have to beat them 
myself... Ugh, there's just no way 
I can do it alone! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Oh, you again??? 
<end> 
<start>Have you decided to join up 
with me? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...Is that so? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Ooooh!! Why don't you just 
walk around until something eats 
you, then! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Pixie joined your party! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...MaGatSUhi... 
LeT me EAt iT...!! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You're still alive, too? 
<end> 
<start>Boy, I sure see a lot of humans 
today. 
<end> 
<start>As a matter of fact... 
I just saw one go down to 
the basement. 
<end> 
<start>I'm so envious of you guys! 
Being able to walk around and 
all... *sigh* 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The Vortex World... 
That's what we call this place. 
<end> 
<start>Of course, the world hasn't been 
reborn yet. 
<end> 
<start>And I don't know what it's gonna be 
like when it does get reborn... 
<start>[7:FF07]If you negotiate well with demons, 
they'll join your party. 
<end> 
<start>About negotiating... Well, I dunno 
all the details, so I can't tell you 
anything specific. 
<end> 
<start>But, don't let that stop you from 
trying! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You're not a human, are you? 
Then, let me tell you something 
good... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Listen up. First, you need to get 
demons to join you. 
<end> 
<start>That's right! You need demons on 
your side. 
<end> 
<start>If you run into a demon, try starting 
a conversation. 
<end> 
<start>I'm sure you'll get a response. 
It won't always be a good response, 
mind you! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You see it too, huh!? 
That g-giant demon in the lobby??? 
<end> 
<start>We c-can't go near there! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Eeeek! A demon! 
There's a demon!! 
<end> 
<start>Demons are scary, right?? 
They attack people, right??? 
<end> 
<start>EEEEK!! I need to text message 
my boyfriend!! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]............ 
<end> 
<start>You're a demon, too??? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Oh, Doctor!!  
<end> 
<start>Thanks to you, I'm back to normal. 
<end> 
<start>...So, when's lunch? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]When you fight demons, you'll have 
a better chance of winning if 
you can get more actions in during 
your turn. 
<end> 
<start>By using attacks that the enemy is 
weak against, you'll be able to 
attack more frequently. 
<end> 
<start>But, the enemy will gain the upper 
hand if you do the opposite! 
<end> 
<start>So, make sure you use your actions 
wisely. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]What!? You're going to defeat 
Forneus!? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]Hahaha... Yeah, right! 
I'll give you all my money 
if you can do that. 
. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I guess I heard wrong... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Amazing... You really beat Forneus!! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]............ 
<end> 
<start>You really beat him... 
<end> 
<start>Dang! A promise is a promise!! 
Take it!! 
<end> 
<start>> You obtained [2:FF05]100 Macca[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I need to escape from poverty first, 
before I can escape from here... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Hey, punk! I've never seen you 
around, and I don't like your face! 
<end> 
<start>You're trying to get by 
without paying respect to me, 
The Almighty Forneus!? 
<end> 
<start>You wanna die, don't ya!? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I screwed up and let another human 
escape a while ago, but not this 
time... 
<end> 
<start>I have a habit of butchering 
anyone who disrespects me. 
I cut 'em up with these fins! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Time to die!!! 
<start>[7:FF07]> Will you leave the area? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]Now entering the big map. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Oh, you're that kid who was 
with Chiaki! 
<end> 
<start>This world is now a Vortex 
and Terminals are important... 
<end> 
<start>Etc, etc... 
And, lastly... 
<end> 
<start>I don't need this, so here. 
<end> 
<start>> You obtained an [2:FF02]Annex Gate Pass[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>Try looking around the hospital 
with that. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]So, is the [2:FF02]Annex Gate Pass[2:FF01] 
doing you any good? 
<end> 
<start>...I see. 
Alright, then. 
<end> 
<start>I think you should save 
your progress here. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]If I knew this would happen 
for reals... 
<end> 
<start>I should've listened to Hikawa. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I don't know the details, but... 
<end> 
<start>I heard that this hospital did 
some pretty horrific things! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> For some reason, you cannot 
go inside the X-ray room. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It's locked from the other side. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You're injured... Here, let me 
heal you. 
<end> 
<start>There you go. Don't push yourself 
too hard. 
<end> 
<start>> Your wounds have healed. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The door to the X-ray room 
is closed tight... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The door is locked. 
Will you unlock it? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> You unlocked the door. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The door is still locked. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Hey, kid!! This place is dangerous!! 
<end> 
<start>There's demons past here!! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained Chakra Drop x 2. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained Magic Bead x 1. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Select a floor. 
<end> 
<start>2F 
<start>[7:FF07]> Select a floor. 
<end> 
<start>2F 
<start>[7:FF07]> Select a floor. 
<end> 
<start>1F 
<start>[7:FF07]> Select a floor. 
<end> 
<start>1F 
<start>[7:FF07]Insert your [2:FF02]Annex Gate Pass[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>> You don't have the right card... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Insert your [2:FF02]Annex Gate Pass[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>> You don't have the right card... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Insert your [2:FF02]Personnel ID Card[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>> It is asking for a Personnel ID Card. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Insert your [2:FF02]Personnel ID Card[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>> You used the [2:FF02]Personnel ID Card[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Insert your [2:FF02]Annex Gate Pass[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>> You used the [2:FF02]Annex Gate Pass[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The gate is open! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> There is a demon going crazy 
in the annex. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> No one is on the roof. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained the Magatama 
[2:FF03]Wadatsumi[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]It is reassuring to see that you 
did not do anything to embarrass 
my little master, such as dying. 
<end> 
<start>My little master has pitied you. 
The least you could do is survive 
such a trivial thing as this. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...Come to think of it, this is 
your first time seeing the new 
Tokyo, is it not? 
<end> 
<start>Allow me to tell you one thing, 
if you don't mind... 
<end> 
<start>Look above you. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]As you can see, Tokyo has now 
become a [2:FF02]circular world[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Now, do you see something shining 
in the center of this world? 
<end> 
<start>That is [2:FF02]Kagutsuchi[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]That is what created this 
Vortex World, 
<end> 
<start>and that is also what provides 
power to the inhabitants of 
this world. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Oh, my little master, 
are we leaving already? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Pardon me, now. I must be going. 
Please keep it up. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You can create a new world, 
or you can destroy this one. 
The choice is yours... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The child and the old woman 
have disappeared... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You feel the presence 
of something... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained the Magatama 
[2:FF03]Marogareh[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>> Will you return to 
the starting point? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]The time has finally come. 
The way shall now be revealed... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...The Yahirono Himorogi that 
you possess... 
<end> 
<start>It shall provide a stairway to 
creation for the strong... 
<end> 
<start>...and a tower of certain death 
for the weak. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Fate awaits you within... 
<end> 
<start>If it is your will, then go inside... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]This... is Tokyo...? 
<end> 
<start>[18:]This doesn't seem like the kind 
of place you'd find sushi. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07][18:]That old guy... what a client. 
This is gonna be one tough job. 
<end> 
<start>[18:]...Oh well. Time to get to work. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...... 
<end> 
<start>...Go... to where... Kagutsuchi... 
awaits... 
<end> 
<start>...Show... me... the beginning... 
<end> 
<start>> The voice could no longer be heard. 
[16:]<start><end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The flames of the [2:FF02]Candelabrum 
of Sovereignty[2:FF01] are flickering wildly... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You can feel the presence of 
a terrifying demon... 
<end> 
<start>> Will you stay here? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> Are you sure? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF02]> ............ 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It looks like you'll be able to 
get away. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It looks like you won't be able to 
escape... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I know you have a Candelabrum! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The flames of the Candelabrum 
burn passionately! 
You won't escape! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You can feel an extraordinary 
power from beyond the door... 
<end> 
<start>> Will you open it? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I thought it'd be safe with Forneus 
dead, but... 
<end> 
<start>Now, there's a demon living in 
the annex even more frightening 
than Forneus! 
<end> 
<start>He looks like one of the Horsemen 
of the Apocalypse! When will I ever 
feel at ease...? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Will you leave the area? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> There is a Mystical Chest. 
Will you open it? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> You did not open 
the Mystical Chest. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 
[2:FF05][3:FF01][2:FF01] x [3:FF02]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You see a Cache Cube. 
Will you open it? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> You did not open 
the Cache Cube. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It's empty. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 
[2:FF05][3:FF01][2:FF01] x [3:FF02]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 
the Magatama [2:FF05][3:FF01][2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 
[2:FF05][3:FF01] Macca[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It's a trap. 
<end> 
<start>> Your party took damage. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It's empty. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> [3:FF03] found something. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]............ 
> You obtained 
[2:FF05][3:FF01][2:FF01] x [3:FF02]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It can't be used here. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The light effect wore off. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The repel effect wore off. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The attract effect wore off. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The levitation effect wore off. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Select a floor. 
<end> 
<start>[3:FF01][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF02][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF03][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF04][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF05][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF06][80EA] 
<start>[7:FF07]You know that [2:FF02]security system[2:FF01] 
at the passageway ahead? 
<end> 
<start>You need an [2:FF02]Annex Gate Pass[2:FF01] 
to get through. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You know that [2:FF02]security system[2:FF01] 
at the passageway ahead? 
<end> 
<start>You need an [2:FF02]Annex Gate Pass[2:FF01] 
to get through. 
<end> 
<start>Oh, wow! You already have it. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]If the volume of your headache is 
cranked up to max, you just have to 
give up and die. 
<end> 
<start>That's the kind of place Tokyo is... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The door is locked. 
<end> 
<start>> Will you unlock it? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> The door is now unlocked. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The door has been left 
unlocked... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You sense strong power 
from beyond the door. 
<end> 
<start>> Will you enter? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> The door is locked from 
the other side... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You cannot use this exit. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The door will not open. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]What does a demon, like you, want? 
<end> 
<start>I'll heal your wounds, so please 
don't eat me! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> ............ 
<end> 
<start>> The soul healed you. 
<end> 
<start>I'll heal your wounds anytime, 
so don't eat me, please. 
<end> 
<start>If you want to get healed, 
ask the lady at the fountain. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You see that demon swimming 
around the lobby, like he owns 
the place? 
<end> 
<start>That's [2:FF02]Forneus[2:FF01]! 
<end> 
<start>As long as he's here, it's not gonna 
be easy to get out of this hospital. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Wow, you're amazing! You went 
WHAM! BAM! POW! and defeated 
Forneus! 
<end> 
<start>He kept us cooped up in this place 
all the time. 
<end> 
<start>Now, we can leave the hospital 
whenever we want! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Who are these Fiends? 
What do they want with Tokyo? 
<end> 
<start>...That includes you. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]What're you staring at me for? 
<end> 
<start>Am I that peculiar? Have you been 
living all your demon life in a cave? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]What are you staring at me for? 
<end> 
<start>Am I that peculiar? Have you been 
living all your demon life in a cave? 
<end> 
<start>Well?? Where'd you come from? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]What are you staring at me for? 
<end> 
<start>Am I that peculiar? Have you been 
living all your demon life in a cave? 
<end> 
<start>Well, if you're going to walk around 
the hospital, let me warn you... 
<end> 
<start>You've chosen to walk the path of 
hardship. You may never again turn 
your back on your enemies... 
<end> 
<start>Keep that in mind. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]What are you staring at me for? 
<end> 
<start>Am I that peculiar? Have you been 
living all your demon life in a cave? 
<end> 
<start>Well, if you're going to walk around 
the hospital, let me warn you... 
<end> 
<start>You've chosen to walk the path of 
hardship. You may never again turn 
your back on your enemies... 
<end> 
<start>Keep that in mind. 
<end> 
<start>By the way... Where'd you come 
from? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You've got "Death" following you. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Come to think of it, you were born in 
the room up ahead, weren't you? 
<end> 
<start>And now, you have been born 
a second time... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Who are you? 
<end> 
<start>Yet another demon after [2:FF02]Magatsuhi[2:FF01]... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The annex is the center of 
conversation now. 
<end> 
<start>Up ahead is the main building... 
You already forgot? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Was it you who defeated that demon 
at the annex? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]That's a lie. 
<end> 
<start>If you get too involved, you won't 
be able to turn back, you know! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I see...  
<end> 
<start>But, if you get too involved, 
you won't be able to turn back, 
you know? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]............ 
<end> 
<start>I can tell by your eyes... 
The human side of you is already 
dead. 
<end> 
<start>You denied your human side, and 
have been reborn as a true demon. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]What? 
<end> 
<start>[12:FF04]? 
[12:FF03], you say? 
<end> 
<start>I don't know anyone by that name... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]What?  
<end> 
<start>Ms. [11:FF02]? Dr. Otsuki? 
<end> 
<start>There's no scientific proof that 
such doctors are in this hospital... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]What? 
<end> 
<start>Baal Avatar? 
Noah, you say? 
<end> 
<start>I don't know anyone by that name... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I saw a human at the annex. 
<end> 
<start>He's probably dead by now... 
Eaten by a demon or something 
weird like that. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Nothing good ever happens when 
demons appear. Case in point with 
that creep Forneus. 
<end> 
<start>They always want our Magatsuhi and 
try to eat us. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I saw a human at the annex... 
<end> 
<start>...But that was a looooong time ago. 
<end> 
<start>I wonder what they're doing now... 
<end> 
<start>Did they change, just like Tokyo did? 
Hmmm... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Forneus thinks this hospital is 
all his. 
<end> 
<start>"All the Magatsuhi is mine!" 
That's what he yells all the time. 
<end> 
<start>So he'll rough you up if you tick him 
off. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]It seems that these Fiends are killing 
each other. 
<end> 
<start>It's like they're competing for 
something... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Hey, you survived the battle royale 
between all those Fiends? 
<end> 
<start>Not bad! 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]Forneus is there, so there's no way 
we could get out... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Hey! Was it a fun city? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I see... 
<end> 
<start>I hear it's a fun city, with 
[2:FF02]stores[2:FF01] and a [2:FF02]club[2:FF01] there. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Forneus? 
<end> 
<start>He's almost as strong as me. 
I... think. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The exit is just as you perceive it. 
<end> 
<start>Were you trying to leave 
the hospital? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]Then, how about next door? 
<end> 
<start>This is the main building, but there's 
an [2:FF02]annex[2:FF01]. Maybe you can use 
that entrance. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...I see. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Well, well, well! 
If it isn't the tatooed boy. 
<end> 
<start>Is the Pixie you went out with 
doing okay? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I HAVE NEVER SEEN A DEMON 
LIKE YOU. 
<end> 
<start>TAKE THIS AS A SIGN OF 
OUR MEETING. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained [2:FF05]Medicine[2:FF01] x 1. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]RARR!! US DEMONS HAVE IT 
ROUGH. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Hey, you there! 
<end> 
<start>The demon next door isn't trying to 
eat me, is he??? 
<end> 
<start>Hey... wait a sec... You're a demon, 
too! Noooooo! Don't eat me!! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Hey, you there! 
<end> 
<start>There's something next door, 
isn't there!? It's a demon, huh!? 
<end> 
<start>Hey, you're a d-demon, too! 
Please d-don't eat me! 
I go bad with ranch! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Hey, you there! 
<end> 
<start>Thanks for beating the demon in 
this room-- Wait... 
<end> 
<start>You're a demon too!! 
You don't wanna eat me! 
I uh... I never bathe! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]There's a demon way stronger than 
you up ahead in the annex. 
<end> 
<start>You'll probably die. 
Nice knowin' ya! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I hear there are demons in Tokyo, 
but there are no gods... 
<end> 
<start>You think that's true? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You can hear something 
from inside the room... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Huh...? Where are we, you ask? 
<end> 
<start>[2:FF02]Shinjuku Eisei Hospital[2:FF01]'s basement, 
of course. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The phone is disconnected. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> There is a notice on the information 
board. 
<end> 
<start>"This hospital consists of 
a [2:FF02]main building[2:FF01] and an [2:FF02]annex[2:FF01], 
connected by a [2:FF02]passageway[2:FF01]." 
<end> 
<start>"Only authorized personnel are 
allowed in the [2:FF02]basement[2:FF01]." 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I can see it... I can see you suffering 
in your battle against demons. 
<end> 
<start>But, this future is only one of many 
possibilities. The future is not 
written in stone. 
<end> 
<start>I shall help you. 
What future do you desire? 
<end> 
<start>A bright future. 
<start>[7:FF07]If you wish for a bright future... 
<end> 
<start>Know your enemies, and use attacks 
that they are [2:FF02]weak[2:FF01] against. 
<end> 
<start>If you do, a bright future full of 
[2:FF02]attacking[2:FF01] shall await you. 
<end> 
<start>It is not easy to learn your enemies' 
weaknesses... Only through battles 
shall you gain knowledge. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Hmmm! Well, if you wish for 
a dark future... 
<end> 
<start>Continue to use [2:FF02]useless attacks[2:FF01], 
<end> 
<start>and your attacks shall be [2:FF02]nullified[2:FF01], 
[2:FF02]reflected[2:FF01], or [2:FF02]absorbed[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>If you do all of this, a dark future full 
of [2:FF02]defending[2:FF01] shall await you. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I shall wait here until you learn 
your future... Bwahahahahaha! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I sense a dangerous power... 
<end> 
<start>A [2:FF02]demon that brings about famine[2:FF01] 
lurks in the room ahead. 
<end> 
<start>You and that demon are fated to 
meet. 
<end> 
<start>Most regrettable... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Did you see that demon flying 
around the lobby? 
<end> 
<start>Even if we could get out, there's 
demons like that everywhere! 
<end> 
<start>All we can do is hide and tremble 
in fear! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Forneus is hella strong! 
<end> 
<start>I lost a hella lot of friends to him! 
It's hella sad! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You're not trying to defeat Forneus, 
are you!? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]Even if you're strong, you won't be 
able to beat him alone! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Don't just beat all the demons. 
Try [2:FF02]talking[2:FF01] to them, and get them to 
join you. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]That's what I thought. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You wanna know? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Ah, forget it! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Oh, come on! Listen to me. 
<end> 
<start>I heard the guy on the black horse 
can seal your magic. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You're amazing! 
<end> 
<start>But, as strong as you are, 
you'll never beat you-know-who. 
I'm too afraid to say his name! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Do you have time to spare? 
<end> 
<start>I saw a human sneak past Forneus 
just a while ago. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Ever heard of the Gaea cult? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]...I think I know it, but I just can't 
remember... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I see... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I heard there's a Fiend on the floor 
above. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]A magazine said that the conflict 
between the Gaea and Messiah cults 
is a war between gods and demons. 
<end> 
<start>Then what about the Fiends? 
Whose side are they on? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]*mumble* 
<end> 
<start>...There are some races of demons 
that rarely join through [2:FF02]negotiation[2:FF01]... 
<end> 
<start>*mumble* 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]*mumble* 
<end> 
<start>...Demon fusion...[2:FF02] Yoma[2:FF01]... [2:FF02]Fairy[2:FF01]... 
[2:FF02]Night[2:FF01]... [2:FF02]Tyrant[2:FF01]... *mumble* 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]*mumble* 
<end> 
<start>...Demons stick together, so [2:FF02]defeat 
the demons in the way first[2:FF01]... 
<end> 
<start>They disrupt conversations... 
*mumble* 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]*mumble* 
<end> 
<start>Speaking of Fiends, there's 
the [2:FF02]Deathstones[2:FF01]... *mumble* 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]*mumble* 
<end> 
<start>There's a trick to negotiating with 
demons... 
<end> 
<start>*mumble* 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]*mumble* 
<end> 
<start>If you keep [2:FF02]Kagutsuchi[2:FF01] in mind... 
You can can meet them again at 
the Cathedral of Shadows... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]What!? You're going to defeat 
Forneus!? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]Hahaha... Yeah, right! 
I'll give you all my money 
if you can do that. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I guess I heard wrong... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You going to defeat 
Forneus...? 
<end> 
<start>Riiiiiiight! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]............ 
<end> 
<start>You really beat him... 
<end> 
<start>Dang! A promise is a promise!! 
Take it!! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained [2:FF05]750 Macca[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Dammit. 
<end> 
<start>I need to escape from poverty first, 
before I can escape from here... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You really beat Forneus? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]......Gaah...... 
<end> 
<start>Maga......tsuhi...... 
......Magatsuhi... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The door is locked from 
the other side... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]......Gaah...... 
<end> 
<start>Maga......tsuhi...... 
......Magatsuhi... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Ew! Those gunky Pretas are inside! 
Here, let me talk in their 
nappy native language... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Pixie changed the tone of her voice. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]"Me have......Magatsuhi...... 
Brought.......lots......" 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]......Gaah? 
<end> 
<start>Maga...tsuhi...? 
<end> 
<start>............ 
<end> 
<start>Me eat!! Me eat!! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The door is now unlocked... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Alright, they fell for it! You ready? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]Oh, fine... Hurry up and get ready! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The door's open. 
<end> 
<start>Are you ready this time? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Still?? Hurry it up! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]There's some demons called [2:FF02]Pretas[2:FF01] 
making a fuss about wanting 
Magatsuhi. 
<end> 
<start>Magatsuhi is the source of 
demonic powers, I think. 
I don't know much about it... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The room next door sure has gotten 
quiet. 
<end> 
<start>So, is Magatsuhi the source of 
demonic powers? No one's given 
me a clear answer... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The other world is always watching 
the thirsty draft horse as it limps 
feebly to the spring. 
<end> 
<start>Do you know if you're in 
the position of that draft horse? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Um, Forneus is strong and mean. 
<end> 
<start>I heard adults say demons are 
outside, too. I want my momma... 
One day she'll come for me... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Ummm... There's a demon stronger 
than Forneus... 
<end> 
<start>He's in the room over there! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Ummmm... The strongest demon... 
<end> 
<start>Becomes the [2:FF02]King of Chaos[2:FF01]! 
<end> 
<start>Mister, are you strong? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Will you leave the area? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]If you go south from this hospital, 
you'll run into [2:FF02]Yoyogi Park[2:FF01] and 
[2:FF02]Shibuya[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>I hear that Shibuya's a fun place, 
with stores and a club and all. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Darn! If only Forneus wasn't here! 
Hope he didn't hear that... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]There's a Fiend now!? 
<end> 
<start>Give me a break, man. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I don't like fighting. 
<end> 
<start>Whether it's for a new world or for 
a new universe... I don't care. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]It seems that you're hurt... 
<end> 
<start>Allow me to heal you. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> ............ 
<end> 
<start>> You've been healed. 
<end> 
<start>I'll heal you anytime, 
so come again... 
<end> 
<start>It may be hard, but don't give up 
now... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]This will be a large terminal. 
Entry is prohibited because  
it is under construction. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]This will be a small terminal. 
It is under construction, but 
it can link to the big terminal. 
<end> 
<start>Do you wish to link it? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]Huh? 
<end> 
<start>Since you're in here, does that 
mean we can get out now? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]If you go through this route, you'll 
reach Akasaka and Sannou. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I hear this Hikawa guy is transferring 
Magatsuhi to Akasaka. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]It seems that this Hikawa guy is 
going to become the leader of 
the world. Cool, huh? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I don't care who the leader is... 
<end> 
<start>I just wanna see the latest issue of 
Ayakashi Monthly!! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Is it okay to trust this Hikawa guy? 
<end> 
<start>What do you think? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I'm a prospector that's a lookin' fer 
buried treasure 'round these parts. 
<end> 
<start>After years a pokin' around, I finally 
located the treasure right here! But... 
<end> 
<start>The earth here's as hard as a rock 
turtle with frostbite! So, I can't dig, 
ya dig? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]............!! 
<end> 
<start>Ya got demons with ya!? 
Hoo-doggie! 
<end> 
<start>Could ya spare one a them demons 
a yers? If ya do, I promise ta split 
the treasure with ya! 
<end> 
<start>C'mon! Lemme have a demon! 
<end> 
<start>My demon's your demon. 
<start>[7:FF07]Man, guess ya woke up with a snake 
in yer boot! 
<end> 
<start>Well, I won't give up!! 
<end> 
<start>Come back if ya change yer mind. 
I'll still be here... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Really!? Hoo-doggie! Thanks! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]*whistle* 
<end> 
<start>How about [3:FF01]? 
<start>No, not that one. 
<start>[7:FF07]Hmmm... 
<end> 
<start>It looks a might weak to me... 
Better take in a few winks. 
This is gonna take awhile! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Whoa! 
<end> 
<start>This one's as ornery as a bobcat 
with his tail on fire! Look forward to 
ma results! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Hey, it's you! 
<end> 
<start>I'm still gettin' ready. Can you come 
back in awhile? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You can hear the sound of rock 
being chipped from inside the hole. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I did it! I did it! 
Hoooooo-dooooooggie!! 
I finally found the treasure! 
<end> 
<start>I owe ya, lil' buckaroo! We'll split 
the treasure, as promised! 
<end> 
<start>There's four chests ahead, so pick 
two of 'em. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Yer not gonna take that one after 
all? Hurry up and pick two! I gotta 
jamboree to go to! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Alright, one more. Pick any one that 
ya like. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Ya picked two, right? Then the rest 
is mine! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Thanks to ya, ma lifelong dream's 
been fulfilled. 
<end> 
<start>You're more useful than a terrier in 
a backyard fulla prairie dogs! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Thanks to ya, ma lifelong dream's 
been fulfilled. 
<end> 
<start>Yer more useful than a cat in 
a barnyard fulla mice! 
<end> 
<start>Here's a little somethin' fer ya! 
<end> 
<start>It was in one of ma chests, but 
I don't reckon I need it. 
<end> 
<start>Ya might be able to find a use fer it. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained a [2:FF02]Kimon Ball[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Your demon kicked the bucket. 
Sorry 'bout that, partner! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]............ 
<end> 
<start>I knew ya would come! 
<end> 
<start>Have ya decided to gimme 
a demon? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Ya don't need to be as humble as 
pie! It's all thanks to ya that I found 
the treasure. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]What's wrong, partner? Go ahead 
and pick any two treasures. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Will you give Shige a strong demon? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> The flag "gave strong demon" 
has been raised. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The flag "gave strong demon" 
is still off. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Advance the digging event? 
<end> 
<start>Advance to step 2. 
<start>[7:FF07]> Advancing to step 2. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Advancing to step 3. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Event is left as step 1. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Watch out for steep slopes! 
<end> 
<start>You'll slide right down to the bottom, 
and then... SPLAT. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I hear those gods summoned by 
Magatsuhi aren't really gods... 
<end> 
<start>Does that mean they're demons? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> There is no answer... 
It's just some drunken buffoon. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Dang! You're pretty tough makin' it 
through that tunnel! 
<end> 
<start>But, you're best off not goin' near 
the Diet Building. 
<end> 
<start>If you get in the way of Commander 
Hikawa... *gulp* 
<end> 
<start>Or, are you here to 'help' 
Commander Hikawa? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]You are, eh? 
<end> 
<start>But, are you good enough!? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Then, Commander Hikawa really will 
make you... *gulp* 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Commander Hikawa's god will soon 
descend upon us. 
<end> 
<start>The Reason of Shijima shall begin. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Commander Hikawa's god is finally 
here. 
<end> 
<start>The final moment of creation has 
begun... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Are you here because you heard 
that Commander Hikawa is 
summoning a god? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]I see... 
<end> 
<start>But, there's no need to help. 
We have 'their' protection. 
<end> 
<start>I won't tell you to turn back, but 
from here on out, I can't guarantee 
your safety... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Ha ha ha! 
<end> 
<start>Someone just like you passed by 
here a while ago. 
<end> 
<start>The Maiden... calling herself Aradia. 
<end> 
<start>Well, we have 'them' in 
the Diet Building. 
<end> 
<start>I won't tell you to turn back, but 
from here on out, I can't guarantee 
your safety... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Hey, you there. 
<end> 
<start>If you're looking for Hikawa, 
you'd better remember this, 
or else... 
<end> 
<start>If he's handsome, hook me up! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It doesn't open from this side. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You slide down too? 
<end> 
<start>Looks like we got the short end 
of the stick. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The flames of the [2:FF02]Candelabrum 
of Sovereignty[2:FF01] are flickering wildly... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You can feel the presence of 
a terrifying demon... 
<end> 
<start>> Will you stay here? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> Are you sure? 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF02]> ............ 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It looks like you'll be able to 
get away. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It looks like you won't be able to 
escape... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I know you have a candelabrum! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]The flames of the candelabrum 
burn passionately! 
You won't escape! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Will you leave the area? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> There is a Mystical Chest. 
Will you open it? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> You did not open 
the Mystical Chest. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 
[2:FF05][3:FF01][2:FF01] x [3:FF02]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You see a Cache Cube. 
Will you open it? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]> You did not open 
the Cache Cube. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It's empty. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 
[2:FF05][3:FF01][2:FF01] x [3:FF02]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 
the Magatama [2:FF05][3:FF01][2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> You obtained 
[2:FF05][3:FF01] Macca[2:FF01]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It's a trap. 
<end> 
<start>> Your party took damage. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It's empty. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> [3:FF03] found something. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]............ 
> You obtained 
[2:FF05][3:FF01][2:FF01] x [3:FF02]. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> It can't be used here. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The light effect wore off. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The repel effect wore off. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The attract effect wore off. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> The levitation effect wore off. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]> Select a floor. 
<end> 
<start>[3:FF01][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF02][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF03][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF04][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF05][80EA] 
<start>[3:FF06][80EA] 
<start>[7:FF07]If you go straight forward, you'll 
reach the Diet Building. 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Hey...! 
<end> 
<start>I just saw a human woman! 
She was headed for Kasumigaseki. 
<end> 
<start>She was creepy, like she was 
possessed by something... 
She was hot, though! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]I think I've finally got it! 
<end> 
<start>The Assembly of Nihilo conceived 
their Reason of... Shijima, was it? 
'A world of stillness', right...? 
<end> 
<start>Aw, forget it! I'll never understand... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Hey, you. It's dangerous up ahead. 
<end> 
<start>It's a maze in there. Plus, 
there are steep slopes. 
<end> 
<start>You'll slide right down to 
the bottom! 
<end> 
<start>If you jump in unprepared, 
you might die of starvation, or 
worse... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]You made it through that tunnel? 
Wow! You must be tough! 
<end> 
<start>But, even you're not tough enough 
to go near the Diet Building. 
<end> 
<start>...If you get in the way of 
Commander Hikawa... Well... 
It was nice knowing you! 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Commander Hikawa's god is 
finally here. 
<end> 
<start>The final moment of creation 
has begun... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Are you here because you heard 
that Commander Hikawa is 
summoning a god? 
<end> 
<start>Yes. 
<start>[7:FF07]I see... 
<end> 
<start>But, there's no need to help. 
We have 'their' protection. 
<end> 
<start>I won't tell you to turn back, but 
from here on out, I can't guarantee 
your safety... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Ha ha ha! 
<end> 
<start>Someone just like you passed by 
here a while ago. 
<end> 
<start>The Maiden... calling herself Aradia. 
<end> 
<start>Well, we have 'them' in 
the Diet Building. 
<end> 
<start>I won't tell you to turn back, but 
from here on out, I can't guarantee 
your safety... 
<end> 
<start>[7:FF07]Commander Hikawa has summoned 
the famous god, Ahriman... 
<end> 
<start>Darn! I wanted to see that... 
<end>
